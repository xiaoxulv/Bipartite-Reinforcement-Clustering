good evening, everyone. i'm carole simpson. some are calling it the battle for jerusalem, but the violence has spread well beyond the city. the weekend has brought the worst outbreak of fighting between israelis and palestinians in four years. at least 26 people are reported dead and nearly 1,000 injured. tonight there is word both sides are trying to end the clashes. president clinton has spoken to both yasser arafat and ehud barak, urging restraint. but as abc's gillian findlay reports, the news comes at the end of a very bloody day and we warn you some of the images are disturbing. gunfire it was nothing short of war in the west bank today -- palestinian anger, building for four days now, exploding on to the streets once again and once again was met by israeli force. in nablus, in ramallah, in hebron, bethlehem and in gaza, the battles went on all day. even in arab towns within israel there were protests and there was blood. what is different now is how well armed the palestinians are. palestinian police did little to stop demonstrators today and there were repeated reports of policemen joining in the fighting, taking on israeli soldiers. right now i'm trapped with a group of other journalists in one of the many clashes today turned deadly. it started with rocks and rubber-coated bullets. now israelis and palestinians are firing at each other using live ammunition. in the streets it's being called the battle for jerusalem. palestinians will not accept israel's claim to sovereignty in the holy city and they are furious with ariel sharon, israel's opposition leader, whose visit to the site of their sacred mosques sparked these riots. last night on television, mr. sharon refused to accept responsibility. "it's not my visit that started this," he said. "the place is holy for jews, too." the man who could have stopped mr. sharon's visit and didn't today blamed palestinian leaders for the clashes. we have solid ground to believe that they were in a great part orchestrated from above. tonight there are reports that both sides are looking for a cease-fire. but other reports say clashing are continuing. four days of fighting, dozens of new martyrs and an image that will haunt everyone in this conflict for years to come. it happened yesterday in gaza, a man and his injured son trapped under israeli fire. the boy is terrified. gunfire "my son is dying," the man yells. and then the shots come in lower. 12-year-old mohammad jamaal al-durra was buried a palestinian hero last night. his father remains in serious condition in a hospital. gillian findlay, abc news, jerusalem.

terror. the palestinian cameraman who recorded it is 45-year-old recorded it is 45-year-old talil aburama. he is the father of three. in tonight's "reporter's notebook," he recalls the moment. again, we warn you what follows is difficult to watch. the shooting is coming down like rain. unbelievable. never, ever i saw shooting like this. i looked at the wall. i find out the boy and the father in the storm. the bullet came to his leg, he got injured in his leg. after that, the shooting start coming fast and fast and faster. the father was moving his hand and trying to get some help. he looked at me, "help." i said, "i can't." he was squeezing the boy to his sides, you know, to try to protect him. in that minute while he was squeezing the boy, the father got bullet in his arm. and so something, boom, just big big dust. i look and my friend, i find out the boy is laying down in his father's lap and the father got more bullets and he was going like this. that minute i was screaming, "the boy is dead. the boy is dead." all i hope is this picture i filmed yesterday to be for the palestinian and israeli negotiators when they negotiate. because a lot of civilians did die for nothing. i want them to understand one of these days, the israeli and palestinian negotiator, maybe one day their own sons will be in the same position.

the white house is also keeping a close watch on yugoslavia, where opposition forces are about to step up the pressure on president slobodan milosevic. but will it work? nbc's jim maceda is in belgrade tonight. serbia on the eve of a general strike. this two-hour roadblock is just a taste of what will come tomorrow, says the opposition, when a nationwide work stoppage is to begin. the purpose, to force out the man they say stole the presidential election, slobodan milosevic. the people don't accept to be victim and to be hostage of one person, milosevic. time is working against him now. but will the pressure work? four years ago, hundreds of thousands of serbs marched against milosevic calling for a general strike as well. the protest lasted three months, but milosevic survived. that's the real question. does the opposition have the power to confront the regime with its combined wealth to get rid of it? a case in point. these coal mine, the very heart of serbia's economy, now on strike, only a handful of workers guarding equipment. but with a week of electricity reserves, these engineers are worried about blackouts. "we're just making a gesture to try to make this regime come to its senses." there are difficulties, too, spreading the word about the strike. independent radio station b-292 has been shut down three times. its signal jammed in belgrade leaving journalists frustrated. i'm waiting for a better time when people in belgrade can hear and listening my radio. poorly organized opposition rallies have been shrinking, now drawing barely 10,000 in belgrade. but opposition leaders hope all that will change tomorrow and civil disobedience throughout the land may give new life to their struggle to oust milosevic. jim maceda, nbc news, belgrade.

The Yugoslavia opposition is urging its supporters to begin a civil disobedience campaign today to force President Slobodan Milosevic to concede defeat in last week's general elections. Protesters blocked several major roads in Serbia Sunday calling the actions dress rehearsals for the general strikes aimed at convincing Mr. Milosevic to relinquish power. Reports also say police sealed off the main pivot, Serbia's largest coalmine where a strike in support of the opposition threatened to plunge large parts of Yugoslavia into darkness. The opposition says its presidential candidate Vojislav Kostunica won last week's general elections by an outright majority. The State Electoral Commission ordered an October 8th run off, saying neither Mr. Kostunica nor Mr. Milosevic won enough votes to avoid a run off. Former NATO commander, retired US General Wesley Walker predicts Mr. Milosevic's next move. It's a little too early for the international crisis stage. First, he is going to try to hold the elections down and move on into the second round and then he will finish the second round of the elections if he can. General Wesley Walker. US Secretary of State Madeleine Albright says it's time for President Milosevic to step aside and let the political opposition do the many jobs it was elected to do. In an essay written for the US magazine Newsweek, Ms. Albright says Mr. Milosevic must go so the opposition can restore democracy, root out corruption and bring Serbia back into the European family of nations. She also writes that Western leaders stand ready to lift sanctions against the government in Belgrade, once a new and democratic administration is in place. The essay comes as Ms. Albright prepares to meet Monday in Paris with European Union Foreign Ministers for talks expected to focus on Yugoslavia's political crisis.

Slobodan Milosevic's gift was an ability to persuade Serbs that someone was out to get them _ and that much of the world was in on the plot. For more than a decade, he presided over an ever-shrinking Yugoslavia that lost four consecutive wars, became an international pariah and chased away its educated elite. Still, even as they descended into poverty, Serbs believed Milosevic was defending their honor against enemies who included Islamic fundamentalists, the pope and President Clinton. The Serb leader, as a result, won elections that were more or less fair. Last week, though, the well of nationalist delusion ran dry. A majority of voters decided that Milosevic himself was dishonoring Serbia, according to an opposition vote count backed by the United States and the European Union. Even the official vote count, managed by his loyalists, conceded that more Serbs (though just short of 50 percent) were against him than were for him. That left only the question of how long he could survive the contempt of a proud people who knew that he tried to steal the election, or how long he could keep the backing of a long-resentful army that has borne the brunt of his lost wars. Yet, whatever the outcome of the struggle to force him to accept electoral defeat, one thing was clear: The logic of Milosevic's hold on the people of Serbia had been shattered. Much of the world had already taken to calling Milosevic a dictator, based on his manipulation of the apparatus of power. But many Serbs didn't see it that way, since he didn't terrorize them and could win elections based on the fiction that he was protecting them from the sea of enemies. Now, by doctoring the results of last Sunday's election, refusing to accept defeat and demanding a second round of voting, the populist demagogue revealed himself to his countrymen as a tyrant hiding behind the trappings of democracy. What was so different about this election? For the first time, Milosevic did not have a handy aggressive nationalist neighbor he could demonize, and even lead Serbs to war against, as a diversion from their own troubles. And the opposition movement inside Serbia, after years of egotistical infighting, had finally figured out how to pull together. Milosevic's loss of legitimacy in Serbia is difficult to understand without a quick look back at how he cemented his populist base in the first place. As communism came crashing down in Eastern Europe in the late 1980s, Milosevic, a relatively unknown party functionary, stumbled upon a survival strategy. During a spring visit in 1987 to the Serbian province of Kosovo, where Serbs had been complaining of mistreatment at the hands of Kosovar Albanians, he broke with a party policy that suppressed nationalistic conflicts. Ignoring the explosive impact of his behavior in a federal Yugoslav state of six republics, three religions and two alphabets, he promised Serbs that they would come first, that no one would mistreat them again. During 1989, a year in which all of Eastern Europe's other communist leaders were being tossed out of office, jailed or shot, Milosevic was riding high as Serbia's president. Weeping Serbian women kissed his official photograph at political rallies as his police stripped Albanians in Kosovo of political rights they had been guaranteed in Tito's Yugoslavia. Milosevic plugged into long-simmering resentments among Serbs, who felt that their status as Yugoslavia's largest ethnic group had never been shown proper respect. Many Serbs, too, shared an abiding feeling of victimization, dating back through 500 years of Ottoman rule and punctuated by their murderous treatment during World War II by Nazis and Croat fascists. Milosevic and the Serbs, however, were not simply remembering or inventing enemies. The splintering of Yugoslavia in the early 1990s left about 2 million Serbs outside Serbia, making them, in effect, minorities in foreign countries. In Croatia, Serbs were bullied, fired from state jobs and sometimes killed. The late Croatian President Franjo Tudjman, a puffed-up nationalist eager to expand the borders of his new country, was made to order for Milosevic. The Croat's witless posturing left the Serbs itching for war. As in all of Milosevic's wars, which started off strong and ended in ignominious Serb retreat, Tudjman's side ended up winning. When there was little to inflame the Serb paranoia that Milosevic needed to remain popular, his regime used state television and radio to manufacture it. Belgrade television showcased terribly mutilated bodies during the Bosnian war, which newscasters described as Serbs butchered by Muslims. The Serb siege of Sarajevo was explained on Belgrade radio as Muslims laying siege to themselves, to win sympathy from the West.

A sharp new debate has sprung up among atmospheric scientists over where to aim efforts to stave off the prospect of global warming from the buildup of heat-trapping greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Some say the main target should be carbon dioxide, the most common greenhouse gas, while others say the most practical solution is to focus first on less common, but more powerful, substances possibly influencing climate, like methane, ozone and soot. The debate comes just as negotiators from more than 150 countries are preparing to head to The Hague, Netherlands, next month to put flesh on the bones of the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, a treaty outlining commitments by industrialized countries to reduce their greenhouse emissions and help poor countries avoid new emissions as their economies grow. The argument for attacking the less common greenhouse ingredients is mainly based on the idea that these substances contribute to harmful air pollution as well as climate change _ and so an easier case can be made to policy makers and the public to clean them up. They are also relatively easy to attack with existing or developing technologies, whereas carbon dioxide can still generally only be reduced by burning less fuel. Proponents of this strategy, most notably Dr. James E. Hansen, an influential NASA climate expert, say that cutting carbon dioxide, at least in the short term, is a far more daunting task because it is a basic byproduct of burning coal and oil. In other words it is a basic byproduct of almost every aspect of modern life. But there are problems with focusing on other heat-trapping substances, as well, other scientists say. Soot and the other greenhouse gases, they argue, constitute an extraordinarily complex brew whose influence on climate, interactions with each other and with clouds and other atmospheric ingredients are still poorly understood. ``When you add in their chemical interactions, most scientists' eyes glaze over, it's so complicated,'' said Dr. Michael Oppenheimer, an atmospheric chemist who is chief scientist of Environmental Defense, a private conservation group. The debate was spurred last August, when Hansen and a team of his colleagues at NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies, which is based in Manhattan, published ``Global Warming in the 21st Century: An Alternative Scenario,'' in The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. In the paper, they said that deep cuts in carbon dioxide emissions were probably impossible in the short run, while the other gases and soot were already being targeted because of their contribution to old-fashioned pollution. In its conclusion, the team used a word rarely found in studies of global warming: ``optimistic.'' The analysis has since been criticized by some longtime colleagues of Hansen and embraced by industry groups and elected officials who have long doubted the science behind climate change and the need for big cuts in fossil fuel use. Just last Thursday, for example, Hansen's findings were repeatedly cited by Republican senators holding a hearing questioning the need for the Kyoto Protocol, which has been signed by more than 100 countries but has yet to be ratified by any industrial powers. Many of the treaty's provisions focus on cutting carbon dioxide. Hansen's critics, including many influential experts on the atmosphere and climate, say that emissions of all of the gases should be curtailed wherever this is possible and not too expensive, but that cutting carbon dioxide still must be a top priority. For his part, Hansen said that both sides in the debate had largely either misrepresented or misinterpreted his study. He said the fundamental goal was simply to find the most efficient _ and politically and economically palatable _ way to cleanse the atmosphere of human effluents that have the biggest impact on climate. He said he still hoped that once the dust settled, policy makers from all parts of the spectrum might find merit in the proposal. ``I think it may be possible to get conservatives and liberals to agree on common-sense steps that slow down the climate experiment,'' Hansen said. The ``climate experiment'' to which he referred is a substantial rise in the amount of greenhouse gases released into the air by human activities since the start of the Industrial Revolution. So far, the insulating effect of these gases is the equivalent of turning on two one-watt Christmas tree light bulbs over each square yard of the earth's surface. That does not seem like much additional energy, Hansen said, but as a comparison he and others have calculated that the extra wattage accounting for the difference between the last ice age and current equable conditions is from 6 to 9 watts per square yard. If greenhouse gas concentrations continue to rise, the human-caused increase in energy bathing the surface could exceed four watts per square yard, a rise that begins to approach the change from the last ice age until now. That is bound to jog climate, Hansen said. Hansen, besides being a respected climate scientist, is an inveterate pot stirrer who in the sweltering summer of 1988 told a Senate committee ``it is time to stop waffling'' about climate change, adding that signs had emerged that humans were causing some of the global warming measured in the 20th century. His new analysis is clearly intended to provoke his peers to re-examine assumptions made over the last 10 years, particularly by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a body of hundreds of scientists working together under the auspices of the United Nations to assess global warming and possible responses. Their first update in five years is due in January. Most atmospheric scientists have long recognized that more than a dozen greenhouse gases and various kinds of particles emitted by combustion and industry affect the flow of energy to and from the earth. (Most particles reflect sunlight like a parasol, cooling the planet; carbon soot tends to absorb it and heat up.) But for the last decade, carbon dioxide has been the main target of climate experts and diplomats trying to stabilize climate. Its concentration in the atmosphere has risen by a third from levels seen before the Industrial Revolution; once added to the air, it takes many decades to disappear; and levels could double from pre-industrial amounts by the end of the new century, scientists project. Also important, it is relatively easy to measure emissions and its sources and ``sinks,'' and processes that remove it from the air are fairly well understood. But Hansen noted that carbon dioxide emissions are not continuing their relentless climb at anywhere near the pace set in the last century, as fuels are used more efficiently and dirty ones, like coal, are supplanted by cleaner ones, like natural gas. Rather than seeking relatively costly additional cuts in carbon dioxide now, he said, the best return on an environmental investment in the short term, he says, would be to look at the other greenhouse culprits on his list. Then, later in the new century, when technologies have matured that offer sources of energy without new streams of carbon dioxide, the emphasis can shift back to that gas. Here is his thinking on the best targets for action now. First there is black carbon _ microscopic soot particles released from inefficient diesel engines, unfiltered power plants or burning forests. These tiny particles, besides harming lungs, absorb heat and also _ like other particles in the air _ form seeds for cloud droplets. They tend to make clouds darker, Hansen says, reducing clouds' tendency to reflect sunlight and make the earth's surface cooler. He said that if continuing efforts to reduce conventional pollution from fossil-fuel burning spread from wealthy countries to developing countries, the amount of this heat-trapping substance in the air will quickly drop. Methane is on most lists of priorities for reducing the greenhouse effect, and Hansen said it has, if anything, been underplayed as an important target. Methane comes both from natural sources like bogs and from a host of human sources, including coal mines, leaking pipelines, landfills, belching cattle and rice paddies. Hansen's study concluded that efforts to shift to rice-farming methods where fields are drained more frequently could cut releases. Also, his team pointed to Australian research showing that changing feeding patterns or mixing certain anti-gas additives in feed for tropical cattle cut by 40 percent their release of this gas without interfering with growth. With 2 billion cows, sheep, and goats belching away _ half of them in the tropics _ there is plenty of potential to cut into the greenhouse effect, he and supporters say. Finally, the Goddard analysis emphasizes the importance of reducing ozone, an evanescent gas that is not on the list of greenhouse gases considered under the Kyoto Protocol because it is not directly produced by human activities. Ozone, a poisonous molecule consisting of three oxygen atoms, is continually formed and destroyed when sunlight hits air, particularly when that air is laden with nitrogen oxides, hydrocarbons, or other emissions from burning fuels or forests. This is the lung-searing brew called smog. Separately, ozone is formed high in the stratosphere, where it shields the planet from harmful radiation. Wherever it exists, it traps heat. Hansen said that as with carbon soot, as China, Mexico and other industrializing countries start to enact pollution controls to cut smog, they will also indirectly be lessening their greenhouse impact. But other scientists say the situation is not that clear-cut. One reason ozone has largely been left out of greenhouse equations so far is that its relationships with other greenhouse gases and other compounds in the air are almost impossibly complex. For example, extremely reactive hydroxyl radicals, OH, which are created as ozone encounters other compounds, destroy methane molecules. In essence, one greenhouse gas eats the other. ``OH is the detergent of the atmosphere, scrubbing everything,'' said Dr. Monika Mayer, a research scientist in the climate program at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. She published a study last month in The Journal of Geophysical Research _ Atmospheres, in which she and several colleagues conclude that future trends for ozone and methane will largely cancel each other out. Generally, she said, models show that although ozone should increase in cities, on average around the globe levels should drop, and this will allow methane to persist longer in the air because there will be fewer hydroxyl radicals there to destroy it. The effects of all of this on climate, she concluded in the paper, are likely to be a wash. Dr. Ralph J. Cicerone, an atmospheric scientist and chancellor of the University of California at Irvine, said he agreed with Hansen that the complexity of chemistry in the atmosphere should not deter efforts to cut ozone, methane and other substances that contribute both to pollution and climate problems. He pointed to recent work showing that although levels of ozone and nitrogen oxides, which help create ozone, have been dropping over the United States and western Europe, they are relentlessly rising elsewhere. One study, Cicerone said, showed that nitrogen oxide concentrations in China, Taiwan, South Korea and Japan rose 60 percent from 1997 to 1998. There is plenty of concrete benefit to be gained, with little of the potential pain that might come from putting the same effort into reducing carbon dioxide emissions. But other scientists fear that any shift away from reducing burning of coal and oil would only impede long-term progress toward limiting the human influence on climate. ``The most important thing is to stabilize all these emissions,'' said Dr. Thomas P. Ackerman, chief scientist in the Energy Department's atmospheric radiation measurement program in Richland, Wash. ``And there's no way you're going to do that without attacking the fossil-fuel problem. We're a society that likes to have simple solutions, but there are no easy answers here.'' For his part, Hansen seems satisfied simply to have nudged the climate debate toward considering partial, common-sense solutions that he feels have been neglected. He added that one way to spur interest would be to illustrate the other harmful qualities of the greenhouse ingredients on his list up close and personal. Maybe, he said, it would make sense to ``lock people in a room with a good bit of ozone and black carbon in the air until they come up with some positive ideas.''

Yugoslav opposition leaders sharply criticized both the United States and Russia today as a general strike against President Slobodan Milosevic gained momentum across the country. NPR's Sylvia Pajoli reports from Podgorica. With the international community anxiously following the Yugoslav political crisis from the sidelines Kostunica accused the Russian government of indecision and said Washington was indirectly helping Milosevic's cause. He was scheming with the United States, which he said never missed a chance to mention that there's an indictment against Milosevic at the War Crimes Tribunal in The Hague as if this were more important Kostunica added than the fate of a nation. And still Russia which has offered to mediate but thus far has not joined western governments in embracing Kostunica as the victor against Milosevic, the opposition leader was very critical. He said Russian policy has been indecisive and reluctant and he described it as one step forward and one back. Sylvia Pajoli , NPR News, Podgorica

Opposition protests continue in Yugoslavia and President Slobodan Milosevic shows no signs of bowing to international pressure by stepping down. Now Russian President Vlademier Putin has offered to be a mediator in the Yugoslavia election crisis. Steve Rosenberg reports from Moscow. In a written statement Vlademier Putin expressed concern of the mounting tension in Yugoslavia which he described as being fraught with unpredictable consequences. Since Russia was a true friend of Yugoslavia, the Russian President said he was prepared to step in as peace-maker and help mediate in the crisis. He invited both Slobodan Milosevic and Vojislav Kostunica to Moscow for talks. For days now the Russian authorities have been banging on Belgrade's door offering to help negotiate a peaceful resolution to the conflict. Steve Rosenburg, BBC News, Moscow.

In Yugoslavia, President Slobodan Milosevic's opponents plan to continue a general strike that began Monday, in an effort to force the certification of the opposition candidate Vojislav Kostunica as the new President. Truck and taxi drivers blockaded roads and bridges and factories throughout the country. Late in the day, President Milosevic held his first news conference since the disputed election. VOA's Eve Cornette reports from Pristina. As thousands of protestors walked off their jobs, President Milosevic warned that if Mr. Kostinitca were to become President, Yugoslavia would, in his words "fall under foreign occupation and inevitably break-up." Mr. Milosevic said his policy guaranteed peace while that of the opposition's guaranteed clashes and hostility. He rejected Mr. Kostinitca's claim that the opposition won outright in a first round, saying a second round was needed. Coal miners, power plant workers and drivers, all joined in the protest to urge President Milosevic to step-down. Meanwhile, Mr. execution by a United Nation's court for alleged war crimes in Kosovo. He argued that by doing so, the United States was, in his words, "strengthening Mr. Milosevic in his belief that these elections are a question of life and death for him."

Premier Tang Fei resigned Tuesday, ending weeks of speculation that he would step down because of health problems and a disagreement with the president over a nuclear plant. Tang, who took the job five months ago, announced his resignation after a brief meeting with President Chen Shui-bian. Tang said the move was prompted by health problems. ``Today, President Chen accepted my request and I'm very thankful,'' said Tang, whose resignation was effective immediately. The former fighter pilot and military chief has been dogged by health problems since he was named premier. In April, he underwent surgery to remove a benign tumor from between his lungs. Eager to begin his new job, he checked out of the hospital too soon and had to return because of an infection. Chen surprised many when he picked the 68-year-old Tang to be his premier. Tang is a member of the former ruling Nationalist Party, not the president's Democratic Progressive Party. He was born in China and favors reunification with the mainland, while Chen and his supporters are mostly native Taiwanese with a history of supporting independence. But Tang's appointment helped calm the public's jitters about the historic change following Chen's March defeat of the Nationalists, who controlled the Taiwanese presidency for more than five decades. He was a levelheaded, familiar figure _ a straight-talking general who worked hard to reform the military. He was also trusted by the United States, Taiwan's most important friend. He served as an attache in Taiwan's Washington embassy in the 1970s. Some of the harshest criticism of Tang has come from Chen's party. His biggest critic has been party Secretary-general Wu Nai-jen, who has accused Tang of being slow to usher in reforms and of ignoring the wishes of the party. Tang's relations with the Democratic Progressive Party became especially tense in recent weeks because he favored finishing the construction of Taiwan's fourth nuclear plant, a $5.4 billion project that is one-third complete. Chen's party has long been opposed to the plant, and the president said he would like to scrap it. But Chen also said the final decision would be made by the Cabinet, which Tang heads.

In a move that rattled Taiwan's already shaky government, Prime Minister Tang Fei resigned Tuesday, citing poor health. Tang, who had been in the job for less than five months, announced his decision Tuesday evening after meeting with President Chen Shui-bian. ``In the past three or four weeks, every time I met the president I told him my health was failing,'' said Tang, 68, who underwent surgery in the spring. ``This time, the president accepted my resignation request.'' Tang's departure is likely to roil Taiwan's political waters. Chen chose Tang, a former fighter pilot and member of the Nationalist Party, to act as a bridge to the Nationalists, whom Chen swept out of power last March. But the Nationalists, who still control the Legislature, have stymied Chen's government at every turn. And Tang made enemies among senior officials of Chen's Democratic Progressive Party. Most recently, he clashed with Chen's party over whether to complete construction of a $5.4 billion nuclear power plant that is one-third completed. Tang favored continuing work, while the party wants to halt construction. With a decision by Tang due this month, his relations with the party had reached a breaking point. ``This symbolizes that Chen Shui-bian cannot hold together a coalition government,'' said Andrew Yang, the secretary general of the Chinese Council of Advanced Policy Studies. ``He will now be under tremendous pressure.'' The resignation could also upset the delicate balance between Taiwan and China. Tang's appointment was regarded as a soothing gesture toward China because of his ties to the Nationalists. Tang, who was born in mainland China, had been defense minister under Chen's predecessor, Lee Teng-hui. Chen, on the other hand, was born in Taiwan and his party had long favored independence, though he has said he would not declare it as president. ``One reason China decided to wait and see was that Chen was going to form a coalition government,'' Yang said. ``Now Chen's party is going to control the entire Cabinet, which is not good from Beijing's point of view.'' Chen's efforts to forge a political consensus have been tortured from the start. The president won with only 39 percent of the vote. As shrewd as it was, Chen's appointment of Tang was criticized by both his supporters and members of the Nationalist Party. Tang was reluctant to take the job because of his fragile health. In April, a month before Chen's inauguration, Tang underwent surgery to have a benign tumor removed from between his lungs. The prime minister's later efforts to form a government were overshadowed by events that _ while out of his control _ he was frequently blamed for. The most serious was a flash flood in central Taiwan that killed four construction workers. While the workers clung desperately to each other, the military and the police bickered over who should respond. Tang's deputy, Yu Shyi-kun, took responsibility for the failed rescue effort and resigned. His name was being circulated on Tuesday as a possible replacement for Tang. The debate over the nuclear plant brought the simmering discontent with Tang into the open. Tang and the Nationalists contend that the project is crucial to Taiwan's economic health. But on Saturday, the economics ministry recommended ending work on the project. Tang had earlier threatened to resign if the plant was scrapped. On Tuesday, he denied that his resignation was related to the dispute.

Taiwanese Premier Tang Fei resigned Tuesday after four months in office, creating the biggest crisis for the shaky, new minority government. Tang, 68, who underwent surgery in April to remove a tumor, said poor health forced him to step down, but many believed that his disagreement with President Chen Shui-bian over a nuclear power plant was a major reason for his departure. Tang favors finishing the $5.4 billion nuclear plant _ Taiwan's fourth _ which is one-third complete. Chen's Democratic Progressive Party has long opposed the plant and the president has said he would like to scrap it, though he left the final decision to the Cabinet, which Tang headed. Presidential spokesman Chen Che-nan said Tang had asked to resign several times because of poor health. The spokesman did not discuss Tang's possible successors. A news conference was scheduled for Wednesday. President Chen, who took office in May, surprised many when he picked the former fighter pilot and popular defense minister to be his premier. Tang was a member of the former ruling Nationalist Party, not the president's Democratic Progressive Party. Tang also was born in China and favors reunification with the mainland, while Chen and his party supporters are mostly native Taiwanese with a history of supporting independence. At first, Tang's appointment helped calm the public's jitters about the historic change following Chen's stunning March defeat of the Nationalists, who controlled the Taiwanese presidency for more than five decades. But Tang struggled to smooth relations with the legislature, still under Nationalist control. Lin Jih-wen, a political scientist at Academia Sinica, Taiwan's top state research institute, said Tang's resignation would cause serious problems for the government. Switching premiers so soon will create a major disruption in the government's current campaign to pass its budget, Lin said. Lee Si-kuen, a political science professor, said Tang's strong personality made him ill-suited for the premiership and that Tang was fed up with his job. Because the premier is not elected, he has little real power and in the end must do the bidding of the president, he said. ``The premier can only do a good job if he's a good friend of the president's or is willing to be the president's slave,'' Lee said.

The Serbian government issued a harsh warning to the democratic opposition on Tuesday, promising ``special measures'' and prosecutions against those organizing a spreading general strike intended to oust Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic. The statement, read on state television, heralded a counterattack on political leaders who are organizing the strikes to support Milosevic's challenger, Vojislav Kostunica, and on the independent news media reporting on the effort. Early Tuesday, the police arrested the head of the public-transport trade union, Dragoljub Stosic, and ordered protesters to clear away their obstacles blocking the bus garage. The government also announced that it was investigating allegations of sabotage against 11 organizers of a coal miners' strike at Kolubara and would seek their arrest. State television said that two opposition politicians who have helped the strikers, Nebojsa Covic and Boris Tadic, would also face charges. The opposition is trying to force Milosevic to concede an outright, first-round electoral victory to Kostunica, who says that only massive government vote fraud denied him the presidency outright in elections on Sept. 24. Milosevic is organizing a second-round runoff for Sunday that Kostunica vows to boycott, saying that his victory was stolen from him and that a runoff is unnecessary. In its statement on Tuesday, the government said, ``The violent behavior of individuals and groups that threatens citizens' lives, disrupts normal functioning of traffic, prevents normal work of industry, schools, institutions and health facilities will be proscribed by law.'' ``Special measures will be taken against the organizers of these criminal activities,'' the government said, adding, ``These measures also apply to media that are financed from abroad and are breeding lies, untruths and inciting bloodshed.'' The statement followed a televised address by Milosevic on Monday in which he labeled opposition leaders _ especially Zoran Djindjic, who is running the strike campaign _ as puppets of NATO and the West. While Milosevic did not name Djindjic, the reference was clear. The Milosevic government is trying to tough out increasingly detailed allegations of vote fraud. An opposition economist, Mladjan Dinkic, said on Tuesday that he had new evidence of vote fraud given to him by officials in the Federal Statistics Bureau, and that its head, Milovan Zivkovic, had told him privately that the truth was on the side of the opposition. Dinkic and his colleague, Miroljub Labus, said they had been given a copy of software used by the Federal Election Commission to distribute falsified and voided votes to Milosevic. In an interview, Labus said that the software had ``flags'' that gave operators options to include prefabricated voting totals into otherwise accurate results. He said the election commission appeared to have counted Kostunica's votes accurately but added ``not more than 170,000 votes'' to Milosevic's totals. Even with confusion about some 50,000 military votes, Labus said, ``I'm absolutely positive Kostunica was elected in the first round. It's a game of small numbers to push Kostunica under 50 percent. But even without the military votes, you find that he has a majority of over 51 percent.'' Dinkic said he also was thrown a computer disc from a window of the statistical bureau that contained election results from individual polling stations. But he refused to reveal the contents, saying that it was up to the electoral commission to come clean. An opposition appeal to the Constitutional Court for a recount of the first round will be heard on Wednesday morning. In the maneuvering, there is increasing concern, especially from Western governments, that the opposition will not push Milosevic from power quickly and that participation in Sunday's second round, despite clear evidence of vote fraud in the first, could be the best way to defeat Milosevic if some international guarantees could be negotiated. Western officials are pressing Russia's president, Vladimir Putin, who has influence over Milosevic, to work to resolve the dispute or somehow postpone the second round. To that end, officials said, Kostunica is expected to accept an invitation by Putin to travel to Moscow to discuss the election dispute, possibly on Thursday. Putin, who was in India on official business Tuesday, has also invited Milosevic, who has not ruled out attending, according to his brother, Borislav Milosevic, the Yugoslav ambassador to Moscow. Jiri Dienstbier, U.N. special investigator for human rights for the former Yugoslavia, said on Tuesday in Belgrade that there had been clear irregularities in the election and urged a recount. ``The results must have been manipulated,'' he said. The strike spread on Tuesday, with some 50,000 students in Belgrade toying with police by deciding to march from the city center toward Milosevic's home in the suburb Dedinje. The police turned the students back after amicable negotiations. The opposition says it wants to call hundreds of thousands of people Thursday from all over Serbia to Belgrade, where the suggestion may come up again. The students had earlier blocked traffic in Slavija Square with garbage containers, but the police removed them with no conflict. At least 30,000 people rallied in Novi Sad, and 10,000 gathered in Nis, two towns that are opposition strongholds. And 50,000 people in Kragujevac came to hear Kostunica speak. The police also removed some roadblocks elsewhere in Serbia, but the main road south was reported to be blocked near Cacak, a center of the opposition, which was nearly shut down. And police dispersed a rally of 2,000 protestors in Vranje, making at least a dozen arrests. Milosevic usually relies on his special police to counter demonstrations. But some police special units stood by while protesters blocked roads, and at least one special police battalion, the 92nd, based in Belgrade, turned in its riot equipment, the Belgrade press reported on Tuesday. In the northern town of Backa Palanka, local police commanders refused to obey orders from Belgrade to remove a roadblock across a main route. And a report that the head of the special police anti-terrorist units, Zivko Trajkovic, was demoted and shipped south to the town of Kursumlija has not been denied by the state news media. The state news media continued to seethe with protests and petitions demanding ``balanced news,'' but the main organs of state propaganda, Radio Television Serbia and the daily newspaper Politika, were largely unchanged on Tuesday. But some journalists in Politika called on their colleagues to consider a strike. Some regional state radio stations went on strike, in towns like Novi Sad and Nis, or simply stopped rebroadcasting state news. In another sign of trouble for Milosevic, the Yugoslav dinar weakened further on the black market; it cost 38 dinars to buy one German mark Tuesday, up from 28 dinars a month ago. The decline was a result of anxiety and of the government's desire to buy hard currency to finance necessary imports.

Two months ago, the Kursk, a Russian nuclear submarine went down in the Barents sea during military exercises. All 118 sailors died. American officials say the Kursk may have sunk after a torpedo misfire but Moscow authorities are still investigating. Many Russian people are skeptical about the inquiry and about the wisdom of trying to recover the remains of the seamen, an operation said to begin in about 2 weeks. The World's Nenad Chebeck reports from Moscow. The tragedy of the Kursk submarine has disappeared from the front pages but is anything but forgotten in Russia. Last month, in accordance with Russian orthodox tradition, a remembrance class was held 40 days after the death of 118 seamen aboard the Kursk. All over the country bearded priests spread out a roll call of the crewmembers. But even the clouds of incense could not hide the two main controversies following the accident - what caused it and what to do with the submarine and the bodies of the crew. President Vladimir Putin promised the families that the bodies will be recovered and Sir Gay Evanell, the Head of the powerful Security Council says the promise still stands. We are going to see through this unique operation. No one has ever done anything like it before. And we do realize that it is very risky, both when it comes to physical dangers for the divers, and to the psychological stress depending on what we find there. But not everyone thinks recovering the bodies is a good idea. Naval captain Biltera Pedro says it's against tradition that sailors have respected for centuries and could also cause great grief. He says, "Just imagine the tragedy of those families when some bodies are retrieved and others aren't." Russia had a similar case way back in 1970s says Pedro, when just one body was recovered. The Fleet Commander then decided to have even that one body handed back to the sea where the submarine went down says Pedro. And it's not just about the tradition in the past, but the future as well argues Alexe Budnev from the Veterans Club of the Russian Fleet. The cost of this operation will be huge. I think it would be much better to invest the sum in improving the rescue capabilities of the Russian fleet, so we can save lives in the future. And while this controversy going on, so does the government investigation to the causes of the disaster. Former submarine captain Ureg Gladkovich says that he is confident the government commission will do a good job. The authorities need to know the truth in order to make whatever changes are necessary for the future safety of the submarine fleet says Gladkovich. But whether those findings will ever reach the public is another matter. Just look back at the way they fudged and lied their way through the rescue operation. They never gave us the full truth. That gives us reason to doubt their good intentions to tell us the truth this time. It all depends on the good will of the military and the government. Unfortunately, Russia doesn't have a political mechanism that would make such an investigation open to the public. Military affairs analysts with the well-respected Russian news magazine Itogi, Alexander Gulls, says the Commission's work is just a smoke screen. He says the cause of the Kursk tragedy is known to those in charge. Our Navy Commanders they know pretty well and all that's going on now points that these people want to hide the real thing that had had happened onboard of Kursk. But what did cause the Kursk tragedy? There are three main theories. Firstly, that a torpedo missile misfired while still in the tube causing a massive explosion in the armory. Secondly, that the sub hit a mine leftover from World War II. And thirdly, a collision with another vessel. Former captain Ureg Gladkovich says that his experience leads into believing another theory. I believe that the Captain over the Kursk took a sudden and drastic maneuver to avoid colliding with another vessel. The waters were shallow for such a huge submarine and the sub maneuver led to the front part of the sub hitting the seabed with great speed. The shear force led to the explosion of the armaments that are stored in the front compartment. The whole front part of the submarine was probably flooded within seconds killing most of the crew says Gladkovich. The ones in the back compartments could have survived for a while, he says, but not more than a few hours, as the sea continued to flood the whole boat after it cracked up. But while the theory sounds very closable, there is no evidence as yet to make it anything more than educated guess work According to military analyst, Alexander Gulls, that is the way things will remain. The huge money that were promised to families avail, receive ten times more than families of soldiers who were killed in Chechnya. For me, it's rather cynical attempt to shut them up. With so many secrets linked to the Kursk, Russia's most advanced nuclear submarine, the full truth may never emerge, even if the bodies and the boat eventually do. For The World this is Nenad Sebek in Moscow.

If the regime of Slobodan Milosevic breaks and Vojislav Kostunica takes office as Yugoslavia's president, it could be because of what happened at this gritty coal mine here Wednesday. Hundreds of Interior Ministry policemen swooped in to break a protest strike at the Kolubara mine, which produces the coal for half of Serbia's electricity. The police ordered the workers, who have been on strike since Friday demanding Kostunica's inauguration as president, to leave. But the strikers refused, calling for help. Confronted with up to 20,000 ordinary people pouring into the mine to defend the workers, some from as far away as the central Serbian city of Cacak and from Belgrade, the capital, 40 miles to the northeast, the police broke and stood aside. One police commander said: ``I'm fed up with this. After this, I'm throwing my hat away and going home. The police in Serbia are more democratic than you think.'' The police watched as Kostunica himself arrived Wednesday evening, pushing through the crowd of miners and their families, to cheers and shouts of ``President,'' coming closer to claiming the prize he says he won with an outright majority in elections on Sept. 24. ``I will be with you until we defend what we won on Sept. 24,'' Kostunica said. ``Is there anything more honest than the miners of Kolubara rising to defend their votes?'' Some miners began to chant, some to cry. ``I'm telling you, what you are doing here is not subversion,'' Kostunica shouted, his voice breaking up over the primitive sound system set up beside him on the steps of a single-story wooden office building. ``You are defending the people's will, and those who step on the people's will and try to steal their votes are the ones committing subversion.'' Kostunica vows not to take part in a second-round runoff against Milosevic this Sunday, saying that the government stole votes and faked the election results. He is appealing to Milosevic to recognize his defeat and step down to spare the country. The opposition is planning a huge rally in Belgrade on Thursday, which it hopes will be decisive and will push Milosevic out. On Tuesday, the Serbian government issued a stern warning to the organizers of this spreading strike, saying that they would be arrested for action that ``threatens citizens' lives, disrupts normal functioning of traffic, prevents normal work of industry, schools, institutions and health facilities.'' The government has accused the strikers here of subverting the national interest, and early Tuesday morning sent the country's top general, Gen. Nebojsa Pavkovic, to tell the workers to go back to work or face punishment. Blaming the miners, the government began power cuts all over Serbia on Tuesday, a reminder of last year's NATO bombing war over Kosovo. And a judge issued a warrant for the arrest of 11 strike leaders, plus two opposition politicians. But the police failed to make the arrests Wednesday. Miners said they had behaved correctly and, said Dragan Micandinovic, an electrical engineer, with ``a sense of shame.'' Micandinovic has remained here for three days except for two brief visits home to see his children. ``During the NATO war, we worked four shifts, including Sundays, and the government called us heroes,'' he said bitterly. ``I was here and saw the missiles flying over my head. Now the government calls us enemies.'' ``But we are victims,'' he said. ``Their victims.'' Slavoljub Sajic, a mechanical engineer, said, ``This is the heart of the protest, the heart of Serbia, and we're not leaving until Milosevic leaves.'' Police hung back while Kostunica spoke, but did not immediately withdraw from the office buildings and other facilities they had occupied earlier in the day. Wednesday night, workers were negotiating with them about whether they would withdraw altogether _ but expressed confidence that the police could not get the mine going again. The police, in camouflage uniforms and riot gear, with helmets and batons, arrived about 11 a.m. when only about 100 workers were gathered. ``They came from all directions,'' Micandinovic said. ``They threatened us and told us to leave or they would drag us out. It was very risky.'' ``There are a lot of people here now,'' he said. ``But it was pretty risky this morning.'' The police set up a cordon around the mine with roadblocks and moved into offices, talking with a strike committee and the management, who are supporting the workers. But Micandinovic and others began to telephone opposition politicians in nearby Lazarevac, 30 miles south of Belgrade, and independent Radio Lazarevac spread the news. Relatives, workers and ordinary people began to come toward the mine, some dodging the police roadblocks by crossing fields and streams. By early afternoon about 1,000 people were trapped behind a police roadblock on a bridge just outside the mine itself. Two opposition politicians, Vuk Obradovic, a former general, and Dragoljub Micunovic, negotiated with the police, to no avail. ``This shows the weakness of the regime,'' Micunovic said as he stood at the bridge. ``They are faking this campaign of an electricity shortage to frighten people and make them suffer and blame it on the opposition.'' The Kolubara coal mine is critical, he said. ``Copper mines are on strike, too, but people can live without copper, not without electricity.'' But the police were clearly unhappy with their orders, Micunovic said, adding, ``Both sides are being very patient.'' One young policeman, accepting some water, said quietly, ``This is a mess.'' He stopped, then said, ``Don't worry, everything will be all right.'' A bus full of protesters moved slowly through the crowd and, almost gently, shoved aside a police van blocking the bridge. The crowd surged forward; the police moved aside, looking sheepish. Some protesters gave them apples and clapped them on their shoulders. The mood on the long walk from the bridge to the strike headquarters was that of exhilaration, even as opposition leaders sped by in cars and buses. Then more cars moved by, with license plates from Cacak and other towns, full of people who had come to defend the mine. People shouted, ``Cacak! Cacak!'' and the slogan of the student resistance movement, ``Otpor'' (``He's finished''). Nadia Ruegg, who is married to a Swiss, told the police to let her through to see her brother, Aleksandar Nikitic. ``When I asked the guy, `Do you have a brother?' he didn't answer,'' she said. ``Then he told us, `We won't beat you.' And we told them, `Well, we won't beat you either.''' In 1914, Kolubara was the site of one of the most famous Serbian victories, when the Serbs turned back the Austro-Hungarian army. The ``Kolubarska bitka,'' or ``Kolubara battle,'' became part of nationalist folklore, and the famous writer and later, briefly, Yugoslav president, Dobrica Cosic, featured it in his novel, ``Time of Death.'' That part of the novel became a stage play in Belgrade in 1986, as Serbian nationalism was growing. At one point, the Serbs wait for ammunition from the French, but when it arrives it turns out to be the wrong caliber. As the soldiers start to wail and weep, the commander turns to the audience and says, ``Don't cry, no one can do anything to us.'' On the Kolubara coal field Wednesday evening, those words were echoed, unwittingly, by Milanko Bulatovic, a miner here for 26 years, who has been here every day of the strike from 6:30 in the morning until the evening. ``This is the end of him,'' he said. ``This is the beginning of the new Serbia. Milosevic cannot do anything to us now.''

It came in a case brought by the Opposition which claims Vojislov Kostunica should be declared winner of the election and President Slobodan Milosevic should acknowledge his defeat and leave office. Opposition leaders said today they feared the ruling would buy time for the Milosevic government to crack down on dissidence.

The Yugoslav constitutional court has annulled parts of last month's contested presidential election. According to the state run news agency Tonugue, the court invalidated opposition claims that President Slobodan Milosevic lost the election. The impact of the court's ruling was not immediately clear and Tonugue said the court's full statement would be released later today. However, the members of the court are known to be Milosevic's supporters and the appeal was brought by the opposition, which asked that challenger Vojislav Kostunica be declared the winner of the September 24th election. Mr. Kostunica's supporters have been staging mass protest demonstration across the country since Monday.

Thank you very much Vick. Yugoslavia's Constitutional Court is expected to release details today about its decision to annul part of the results of the recent presidential elections. The official Tanugue news agency says the Court acted Wednesday following an emergency session to hear opposition complaints about vote rigging and the decision came just hours after the opposition said President Slobodan Milosevic had until 3 p.m. local time today to resign and announce the true election results. The opposition claims its candidate won more than half the vote.

The Voice of America presents differing points of view on a wide variety of issues. Next, an editorial expressing the policies of the United States government. The pressure is mounting for Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to concede defeat to challenger Vojislav Kostunica. Mr. Milosevic has claimed that neither candidate won the necessary 50 percent of the vote in the presidential election making a runoff on October 8th necessary. The opposition says it received an absolute majority, based on certified results from polling places and sees no need for a run off. The Serbian Orthodox Church and other nations support the opposition's claim of victory. The Yugoslav Constitutional Court is now disputing the validity of parts of the election results. A general strike is underway to demonstrate to Milosevic that he has already lost control of the country. Workers at mines serving two of Yugoslavia's biggest power plants have walked out. In Eastern Serbia, 4500 miners have put down their tools at the Kostrolots mine. Taxi drivers, railways staff and oil refinery workers have also joined the work stoppage. Road blockades have been set up across the country. A convoy of 70 trucks blocked a key highway in Yugoslavia with drivers brandishing banners and posters of Mr. Kostunica. It appears that Milosevic is also losing his grip on the state media. One example is Pherchevia Novosty, a popular tabloid the state took over in March. Now more than 60 reporters have signed a petition demanding a return to balanced news coverage within 24 hours. In an open letter, they demanded that the paper stop linking itself to the interests of a narrow political party or person, but only to the truth and the will of the people as expressed in the elections. There is a similar petition at Belgrade Radio, part of the state system. Eight local radio stations also said they would stop broadcasting state news. Clearly Milosevic must go. The Serbian people have voted overwhelmingly in favor of democracy and of an end to their international isolation. As soon as a democratic government is in place, the US will immediately take steps to remove economic sanctions and help Serbia with its transition. Listen to the people, Mr. Milosevic, it is time to go.

In what may be an attempt to buy time for Slobodan Milosevic, Yugoslavia's highest court invalidated parts of the presidential election on Wednesday after thousands of opposition supporters forced police to back off from seizing a strikebound mine. The constitutional court ruling, reported by the state news agency Tanjug, came in a case brought by the opposition _ which sought to have Vojislav Kostunica declared the winner of last month's election. Instead, the court annuled ``parts'' of the election, the agency said, adding details of the ruling would be made public Thursday. If the presidential vote _ or even parts of it _ must be repeated, it means Milosevic retains power longer. The announcement came on the eve of a planned mass rally in Belgrade that the opposition hoped would be the final push to force Milosevic to concede defeat. Milosevic acknowledges Kostunica finished first in a five-candidate field on Sept. 24 but without a majority needed to avoid a runoff Sunday. The opposition has rejected a runoff. Opposition official Goran Svilanovic said he believes the opposition will also not agree to take part in a rerun of the first round. ``We have our elected president,'' he said. ``These are things we can discuss, but my initial reaction is that there can be no bargaining.'' The opposition, challenging the official findings of the Federal Electoral Commission, went to Yugoslavia's highest court earlier Wednesday, appealing to the justices to grant them victory in the presidential elections. The court met in emergency session Wednesday to hear complaints by the 18-party opposition coalition, maintaining Milosevic's supporters manipulated election results by using a sophisticated software program. Opposition leaders said they had obtained a copy of the program and would use it to illustrate how the vote was rigged to favor Milosevic's candidacy. Earlier Wednesday, Milosevic's police abandoned barricades at a striking coal mine 25 miles south of Belgrade and mingled with thousands of workers seeking to topple the Yugoslav president. The turnout gave opposition forces hope that the regime was mortally wounded. ``The battle for Serbia was won here,'' cried one jubilant opposition leader, Dragan Kovacevic. The stunning and swift turn of events at the Kolubara mine complex was unprecedented in a former communist nation with no history of major worker uprisings. It caught even top opposition figures off guard. They rushed to join more than 10,000 protesters at the mine and predicted Milosevic's quick demise. Opposition leaders issued an ``ultimatum'' for Milosevic to resign by 3 p.m. Thursday _ the time set for the Belgrade rally. ``This flame will engulf the whole of Belgrade,'' said Vladan Batic, an opposition leader. In an open letter Wednesday to Milosevic before the court's ruling, Kostunica said ``it will be better for you to recognize'' electoral defeat or risk ``the danger of open clashes'' nationwide. ``Serbia has risen so that one man would leave,'' Kostunica told cheering workers and their supporters at the Kolubara mine. Only hours earlier, police in riot gear had poured in and occupied the strip mine complex in an attempt to break up the largest of the nationwide strikes against Milosevic. But the police couldn't contain a swelling crowd that heeded the workers' cry for help. With sunset approaching, the police gave up. Most withdrew from their barricades and were mingling with strikers inside the compound. Supporters of the strikers streamed in on foot and in convoys of vehicles. One bus pushed aside a police car blocking its way. A few police remained guarding some areas of the mine, but made no attempt to control the joyous crowd. From the beginning of the civil disobedience campaign launched this week to force Milosevic to concede defeat in the election, the mine was a pivotal point. It employs 7,000 workers and supplies major power plants. On Tuesday, the Milosevic government had threatened ``special measures'' against leaders of strikes and road blockades, and Belgrade's prosecutor issued arrest orders for 13 opposition leaders involved in organizing the walkout at the Kolubara mine. None of the arrests has been carried out. The mine walkout was the forerunner of other strikes: the state telecommunications company workers announced they would stay off the job and city bus drivers and garbage collectors in Belgrade refused to work. ``This is (Milosevic's) end,'' said a Kolubara mine worker, Dragan Stamenkovic. ``Now the workers have risen.'' Before the court's ruling, the government was pushing ahead with plans for the runoff, where voters will mark paper ballots bearing the names of Milosevic and Kostunica. The opposition insists it is pointless to participate because Milosevic will simply cheat again. In July, the Milosevic-controlled parliament changed the constitution, removing any requirement for a minimum voter turnout. Prime Minister Momir Bulatovic, meanwhile, repeated the position that regardless of the election outcome, Milosevic can remain in office until his current term expires in June. There were also signs that Milosevic's control over the media, until now the principal propaganda pillar of his regime, was fraying. The main state-run daily in the northern province of Vojvodina declared Wednesday that its editorial policy would switch from following the government line to reporting on events objectively. Its Wednesday edition for the first time carried numerous reports on opposition activities.

Opposition official Goran Svilanovic said he believes the opposition will also not agree to take part in a rerun of the first round. ``We have our elected president,'' he said. ``These are things we can discuss, but my initial reaction is that there can be no bargaining.'' The opposition, challenging the official findings of the Federal Electoral Commission, went to Yugoslavia's highest court earlier Wednesday, appealing to the justices to grant them victory in the presidential elections. The court met in emergency session Wednesday to hear complaints by the 18-party opposition coalition, maintaining Milosevic's supporters manipulated election results by using a sophisticated software program. Opposition leaders said they had obtained a copy of the program and would use it to illustrate how the vote was rigged to favor Milosevic's candidacy. Earlier Wednesday, Milosevic's police abandoned barricades at a striking coal mine 25 miles south of Belgrade and mingled with thousands of workers seeking to topple the Yugoslav president. The turnout gave opposition forces hope that the regime was mortally wounded. ``The battle for Serbia was won here,'' cried one jubilant opposition leader, Dragan Kovacevic. The stunning and swift turn of events at the Kolubara mine complex was unprecedented in a former communist nation with no history of major worker uprisings. It caught even top opposition figures off guard. They rushed to join more than 10,000 protesters at the mine and predicted Milosevic's quick demise. Opposition leaders issued an ``ultimatum'' for Milosevic to resign by 3 p.m. Thursday _ the time set for the Belgrade rally. ``This flame will engulf the whole of Belgrade,'' said Vladan Batic, an opposition leader. In an open letter Wednesday to Milosevic before the court's ruling, Kostunica said ``it will be better for you to recognize'' electoral defeat or risk ``the danger of open clashes'' nationwide. ``Serbia has risen so that one man would leave,'' Kostunica told cheering workers and their supporters at the Kolubara mine. Only hours earlier, police in riot gear had poured in and occupied the strip mine complex in an attempt to break up the largest of the nationwide strikes against Milosevic. But the police couldn't contain a swelling crowd that heeded the workers' cry for help. With sunset approaching, the police gave up. Most withdrew from their barricades and were mingling with strikers inside the compound. Supporters of the strikers streamed in on foot and in convoys of vehicles. One bus pushed aside a police car blocking its way. A few police remained guarding some areas of the mine, but made no attempt to control the joyous crowd. From the beginning of the civil disobedience campaign launched this week to force Milosevic to concede defeat in the election, the mine was a pivotal point. It employs 7,000 workers and supplies major power plants. On Tuesday, the Milosevic government had threatened ``special measures'' against leaders of strikes and road blockades, and Belgrade's prosecutor issued arrest orders for 13 opposition leaders involved in organizing the walkout at the Kolubara mine. None of the arrests has been carried out. The mine walkout was the forerunner of other strikes: the state telecommunications company workers announced they would stay off the job and city bus drivers and garbage collectors in Belgrade refused to work. ``This is (Milosevic's) end,'' said a Kolubara mine worker, Dragan Stamenkovic. ``Now the workers have risen.'' Before the court's ruling, the government was pushing ahead with plans for the runoff, where voters will mark paper ballots bearing the names of Milosevic and Kostunica. The opposition insists it is pointless to participate because Milosevic will simply cheat again. In July, the Milosevic-controlled parliament changed the constitution, removing any requirement for a minimum voter turnout. Prime Minister Momir Bulatovic, meanwhile, repeated the position that regardless of the election outcome, Milosevic can remain in office until his current term expires in June. There were also signs that Milosevic's control over the media, until now the principal propaganda pillar of his regime, was fraying. The main state-run daily in the northern province of Vojvodina declared Wednesday that its editorial policy would switch from following the government line to reporting on events objectively. Its Wednesday edition for the first time carried numerous reports on opposition activities.

Taiwan's new premier announced a Cabinet reshuffle on Thursday that brings in a new finance minister, vice premier and government spokesman. The changes come two days after former Premier Tang Fei resigned, the biggest crisis yet for the four-month-old minority government. Tang, who cited poor health as his reason for quitting, stepped down amid a bitter dispute about a nuclear plant and growing concerns about the slumping stock market. On Thursday, Premier Chang Chun-hsiung said that the new finance minister would be Yen Ching-chang, who has served as vice finance minister. He replaces Shea Jia-dong, whom many investors blamed for the market's recent slide. The premier also said that former Grand Justice Lai In-jaw would take over Chang's old job as vice premier. The new government spokesman will be Taiwan Daily News senior editor Su Cheng-ping, who replaces Chung Chin, an economist whose lack of public relations experience hampered her effectiveness. The Cabinet's new secretary-general is Chiou I-jen, the former deputy secretary-general of the National Security Council, which advises the president on the island's security policies. Chiou replaces Wea Chi-lin. Chiou's successor in the National Security Council is veteran journalist Antonio Chiang, publisher of the English-language Taipei Times daily. Chang repeated his pledge that the economy and political stability would be the most important issues for the government. ``We hope that all of the opposition parties will work hard to cooperate with us,'' Chang said. Many have speculated that Economics Minister Lin Hsin-yi will resign or be removed from his post. But Chang did not say whether Lin would keep his job. One of Chang's most pressing tasks as the government's third most powerful leader is to restore investors' confidence in the administration, which took office in May. Taiwan's stock market has been on a steady slide since May, losing about 40 percent of its value. Many investors worry that President Chen Shui-bian's government lacks a clear economic policy and favors social issues over business. Tang had struggled to halt the market decline. Chang's appointment failed to comfort investors immediately. Blue chips closed down 2.36 percent Wednesday, and trading volume was at its lowest since Sept. 27, 1999, when the island was recovering from a devastating earthquake. Chang, 62, is a former lawmaker with a reputation for being an adept negotiator who can unite people across party lines. His mediating skills are desperately needed in Taiwan's fiercely partisan legislature, where the president's Democratic Progressive Party has a minority. Since taking office in May, Chen's approval rating has been slipping. After his first month in office, Chen's approval rating was 77 percent; since Tang's resignation, the number has dipped to a new low of 37 percent. Chang sought to calm investors Wednesday and to win over opposition lawmakers, pledging to work hard to restore political stability. ``We will use our greatest efforts and most sincere, modest attitude to listen to the public and the opposition parties,'' Chang said.

As a massive popular uprising against Slobodan Milosevic spreads, there are signs that even one of the autocratic ruler's mainstays _ the pro-government media _ seem to be switching sides. The management of such staunchly pro-Milosevic outlets as the official Serbian television and the state-run Politika daily are facing demands by usually servile journalists and technicians that editorial policies be changed to include reports about the opposition. Staff walkouts are likely if they don't bend. In central Serbia, several branches of the official television have already stopped broadcasting the program from their Belgrade headquarters and are opting for their own newscasts. Those include reports about opposition claims of electoral fraud by Milosevic and objective newscasts free of the insults usually heaped on the opposition. Some dailies, such as the state-run Dnevnik newspaper in northern Serbia, have either already included reports on opposition activities and growing strikes and blockades, or will soon be forced to by their rebellious employees. Any loss of control over state media for Milosevic is likely the herald of his demise after more than a decade of control over Yugoslavia. The slow collapse of Milosevic's authority began after Sept. 24 presidential elections. Backers of his rival, Vojislav Kostunica, claim outright victory in that balloting, something Milosevic's camp has denied. But as a wave of opposition strikes and protests have paralyzed Serbia, the main Yugoslav republic, discontent also was spreading among staff of state media. ``We demand that the editors and journalists ... who are still taking part in the biased reporting, to refuse obedience ... and join their colleagues who have already distanced themselves from such policies,'' some of the state television staff said in a letter carried by Beta news agency. The journalists, technicians and producers of state television threatened a strike starting Thursday, the day the opposition has summoned all supporters to gather in Belgrade for what organizers hope will be the largest ever anti-Milosevic rally. A similar simmering rebellion was reported by staff of the Politika daily. Elsewhere, one of the departments of the state-run radio ceased broadcasts. So did several pro-government radios throughout Serbia. The state-run media were a key tool in bringing Milosevic to power in Serbia in 1987. Firm control over the state television _ the only TV in the whole country _ and several newspapers has been a main pillar of Milosevic's rule, and the Yugoslav president has fought hard against any attempts of a takeover. In March 1991, a protester and a policeman were killed in Belgrade during demonstrations called because of the unprecedentedly biased reporting of the official television. The TV building in downtown Belgrade was guarded with army tanks against the demonstrators. The editor-in-chief was finally replaced, but the editorial policies remained unchanged and firmly pro-Milosevic. Aware of television's importance for Milosevic, NATO bombed the TV headquarters in downtown Belgrade during last year's air war against Yugoslavia, killing 16 employees. Because most people associate the state media with Milosevic, they have become a symbol of his autocratic rule and thus probably the most hated state institution among the pro-democracy movement. During major anti-Milosevic protests four years ago, the state television and Politika buildings were pelted with eggs and stones thrown by furious demonstrators.

Police battled demonstrators Thursday and black smoke billowed from parliament after security forces drove off mobs trying to storm the building to demand Slobodan Milosevic accept electoral defeat. Clashes spread through the streets of the capital, which echoed with the sound of stun grenades and tear gas fired to break up the crowds. Dozens of people were injured, according to witnesses. The melee erupted at the start of a huge rally the opposition called to force Milosevic to accept electoral defeat by Vojislav Kostunica in the Sept. 24 election. In what was apparently the largest anti-Milosevic protest since his 13-year rule began, hundreds of thousands of people had assembled less than an hour before the rally was to begin, and tens of thousands more were seen streaming into the city.

Mobs seeking to topple Slobodan Milosevic turned their fury on his centers of power Thursday, leaving parliament and other key Belgrade sites in shambles and flames and pushing the Yugoslav president to an inevitable choice: fight back or bow down. Hundreds of thousands of people swarmed the capital to demand that Milosevic accept his apparent electoral defeat by Vojislav Kostunica in the Sept. 24 election. As demonstrators charged and riot police cowered behind helmets and shields, the federal parliament building, the state broadcasting center and police stations fell in quick succession. Demonstrators tossed documents and portraits of Milosevic through the broken windows of the parliament complex. Smoke billowed from the building and from the state television headquarters nearby. Dozens of people were injured, according to witnesses. ``What we are doing today is making history,'' Kostunica proclaimed during an evening speech in front of Belgrade city hall, across from parliament. ``We call on the military and police to do everything to ensure a peaceful transition of power.'' The crowd chanted for Milosevic's arrest. Kostunica answered: ``He doesn't need to be arrested. He arrested himself a long time ago.'' At the White House, President Clinton said: ``The people are trying to get their country back.'' British Prime Minister Tony Blair said of Milosevic: ``Your time is up. Go now.'' Clashes spread through the capital, which echoed with the sound of stun grenades and tear gas fired to break up the crowds. Later, both state television channels went off the air, leaving TV screens black. The uprising swelled as security forces showed little willingness to battle the largest anti-Milosevic protest in his 13-year rule. Many police joined the flag-waving crowds as they surged across central Belgrade. Thousands more people joined smaller rallies in towns throughout the country. There was no immediate reaction from Milosevic, and his whereabouts were not known. A statement from his Socialist Party of Serbia said it would ``fight against violence and destruction'' with ``all its force and in all state institutions,'' the state-run Tanjug news agency reported. There were fears the mayhem could allow Milosevic to declare a state of emergency and come down hard on his foes. But his security forces appeared to be disintegrating, with protesters seizing police precincts without a fight. The level of defiance was unprecedented in Yugoslavia's 55-year communist history. Some policemen discarded their uniforms and fled. Others embraced demonstrators. ``They're giving up,'' said a demonstrator who identified himself only as Sasha. The government acknowledges that Kostunica outpolled Milosevic in the Sept. 24 election but says he fell short of a majority in the five-candidate race. A runoff had been set for Sunday. The president has already countered in the courts in an apparent bid to cling to power: The Milosevic-controlled Yugoslav Constitutional Court issued a decision Wednesday that one justice said nullified the election. The justice, Milutin Srdic, told Radio Free Europe that Milosevic could remain in office until his term expires in July. The ruling outraged opposition supporters. Hundreds of thousands streamed into Belgrade from around the country for the opposition rally, and Thursday's melees erupted as the rally was beginning. The quick outbreak of violence suggested that opposition leaders had little control over some factions that may be driven by frustration over Yugoslav's disastrous economy. One attempt to storm parliament was repulsed by tear gas, but following waves of protesters broke through. By late afternoon, opposition supporters who had been inside the parliament building were climbing through the windows and onto the complex's balconies, waving flags as the crowd roared below. Inside the building, chaos reigned. Gangs of young people, many of them intoxicated, roamed the building, smashing furniture and computers and looting what valuables they could carry. But police offered little resistance and the clashes ebbed. Afterward, crowds of demonstrators, some drunk and brandishing handguns, roamed the streets. Many protesters wore paper caps with the slogan, ``We'll Endure.'' They moved past shops, some shut down with signs stating, ``Closed because of Robbery'' _ an allusion to opposition claims that Milosevic stole the elections. A few ambulances tried to take injured policemen to the hospital. Crowds of drunken youths stopped them and demanded the ambulance crews hand over the injured officers. In the evening, more than 100,000 people gathered in front of parliament before Kostunica spoke. Protesters _ from burly farmers to black-robed Serbian Orthodox priests _ waved Yugoslav flags outside the building, where Milosevic was sworn in to another term in 1997 and promised ``peace, progress and prosperity.'' ``At this moment, terror rules in Belgrade,'' the pro-Milosevic government television said in a commentary earlier in the day. ``They are attacking everyone they see on the streets and there is chaos.'' The state television went off the air in the afternoon after a bulldozer, apparently commandeered by demonstrators, broke into the state TV building and demonstrators poured inside. Police fled out the back or surrendered and flames engulfed part of the building, which was hit during NATO airstrikes last year. Before Thursday's protest, police had set up roadblocks outside Belgrade, but the convoys of protesters were so large that most of them were allowed to pass. A convoy of about 2,000 people was briefly blocked about 30 miles south of Belgrade, but it eventually pushed its way through barricades. Protesters used a front-end loader to shove aside two sand trucks used by authorities to try to block a 12-mile-long line of cars and buses with about 15,000 people. Riot police stood by without intervening.

Some were drunk and brandishing handguns. Many protesters wore paper caps with the slogan, ``We'll Endure.'' They moved past shops, some shut down with signs stating, ``Closed because of Robbery'' _ an allusion to opposition claims that Milosevic stole the elections. Several shop windows were shattered, and orange flames still billowed from one section of the parliament building. Big trucks with loudspeakers drove through Belgrade blasting folk and rock music. The downtown headquarters of the Yugoslav Left, the neo-communist party run by Milosevic's wife, was demolished, with the graffiti ``People's Revolution'' sprayed on inside walls. More than 100,000 people gathered in front of parliament before Kostunica's evening speech. Protesters _ from burly farmers to black-robed Serbian Orthodox priests _ waved Yugoslav flags outside the building, where Milosevic was sworn in to another term in 1997 and promised ``peace, progress and prosperity.''

good evening. there has been a revolution in yugoslavia. and, as of tonight, the people seem to have won. take a look at these scenes in belgrade. even the police are with the people. people fed up with being the poorest country in europe, cut off from the rest of the world, an economic basket case, beaten down by the nato bombing and economic sanctions. we talked to colleagues in yugoslavia throughout the day. what was the straw that broke the camel's back? what did the dictator, slobodan milosevic, finally do wrong? milosevic called a free election said one of them, and when he refused to accept the results, finally the long-suffering serbs had had enough. we do not know precisely tonight where slobodan milosevic is or what his plans are. is he somewhere in the serbian countryside? has he left the country? perhaps for exile in russia? we do know the leader of the opposition is now the new president. first here's our rorter, bob woodruff. tonight, the people of belgrade celebrate with their police. the security force once loyal to slobodan milosevic are now with the opposition. and the people have reclaimed the yugoslav parliament building. but the day did not start this way. fighting through tear gas this morning, demonstrators stormed and occupied the yugoslav parliament building, a human tide of anger and frustration, and finally joy. the police were remarkably restrained. if there were orders to use violence against the people, those orders were ignored. as smoke rose from parliament, the riot squads were forced to retreat. the crowds attacked the symbols of the state. they seized the government-controlled television station and burned it. the broadcast cut to a concert and then to black. hours later, opposition stations broadcast scenes of the revolution. on the steps of the parliament, milosevic's opponent, vojislav kostunica, announced that he is now president. "serbia has taken the road of democracy," he said, "and where there is democracy, there is no place for slobodan milosevic." milosevic was nowhere to be seen, as the people rose up against him. although there were fears that this chaos would invite a military response, the yugoslav army stayed away. tonight, the president of montenegro, long threatened by milosevic, told abc news that the more than 15,000 yugoslav troops stationed here have not left their barracks. he believes the military will no longer obey their president. "milosevic," he says, "is a man whose political time has expired." tonight on the streets of belgrade, no one seems to doubt that. bob woodruff, abc news, podgarica, yugoslavia. we have been talking to belgrade throughout the day and just before the broadcast tonight, i checked in briefly with two men who know yugoslavia better than most. first some comments from steve erlanger of "the new york times." this has been quite a remarkable day. the serbs have risen up and taken back their country. the army has stayed out of things. what's the mood on the streets as you just wander around and talk to people? there's still a lot of anger. there's a little shame at the burning of the federal parliament itself, but i think a great deal of self-respect tonight. but still also some fear that during the night, somehow, some way, mr. milosevic, a very crafty man, will strike back. and then we talked to misha glenny, who knows the whole region extremely well, working tonight for abc. peter, this is the most amazing thing i have ever seen. almost an entire people has risen against its leader, slobodan milosevic, and thrown him out of power in what i can only describe as a furious outburst of fervor. it is like everyone is coming out of a nightmare here in belgrade and there's no way slobodan milosevic is going to get back. the police have already given up entirely, and the army also are not going to move against this people. they are surrounded by demonstrators. they've handed over their helmets, their jackets, their weapons. they cannot fight against this. what do you know about the rest of the country? the rest of the country does matter because it is the rest of the country which has created this revolution. over the past five or six days, belgrade has been reluctant. tall media have been blocked, but in the rest of the country, the most astonishing things have happened. u.s. intelligence has tried to keep an eye on this. go to john m wethy. milosevic, do they think he's going into exile or might he stay in serbia? growing circumstantial evidence that he probably will have to leave, peter, although analysts warn never count this man out. it will be his last resort, if he does leave. they have some intelligence indicating he's tried to get ahold of some of his top military commanders and has been unable to do so. now he's an indicted war criminal. does the u.s. plan to arraign him? any country willing to take milosevic that the u.s. will not stand in the way. what should we be looking for in the next 24 snours. one of the things american intelligence is looking for, a neighbor, romanian has given clearance for a transport to fly into yugoslavia and out tomorrow99 tomorrow. abc news has learned that this is something they are going to be watching, u.s. intelligence very closely. thank you very much, john. watch for a russian military transport. this broadcast continues at abc news.com, where there is a good deal more about this, including a profile of vojislav kostunica, the man who's now in charge and a name now to be remembered.

This is The World. I'm Lisa Mullins. Not since he took power 13 years ago, has Yugoslavia's President Slobodan Milosevic appeared so close to losing it. His grip began to slip on September 24th, when as even he admitted opposition candidate Vojislav Kostunica won more votes in a nation wide election. Milosevic claimed, however, that Kostunica had failed to win at least 50% and that another ballot would be necessary. The opposition insisted that Kostunica had won outright and staged mass anti-Milosevic demonstrations. Today, the protest reached a climax as hundreds of thousands of people took to the streets of Belgrade. The crowds took over the parliament building and a state television center and the events of the day resembled nothing so much as a popular revolution. The World's Nenad Chebeck takes us to the streets of the Serbian capital in his eyewitness report. Rock drummer Dragon Zuricic pounded out a beat for marching and hundreds of thousands of demonstrators took up the call. Within minutes, the center of the town was blocked solid. Opponents of Slobodan Milosevic called on the Yugoslav President to relinquish power immediately. An opposition spokesman demanded that Milosevic accept the electoral will of the people, that the Federal Electoral Commission reveal what she called the true result of the election. There were speeches and even songs, denouncing Slobodan Milosevic and praising opposition leader, Vojislav Kostunica. But the singing stopped and at least some shooting began. The crowd converged at the Federal Parliament building and tried to storm it. The police retaliated with tear gas and most streets around the buildings were full of people and tear gas. The mood became angry and several police cars were smashed or set ablaze. Then the demonstrators turned their fury towards a nearby police station. That's when the mass protest took what may have been a "turning point". The police gave themselves up without a fight and some of them even joined the demonstrators. Then the crowd marched over to the state run televison station. Much to the demonstrators' surprise dozens of heavily armed riot policemen simply walked out of the building and offered no resistance. Elsewhere in Belgrade, journalists at three other television stations and the radio station B92 took over their newsrooms vowing to report independently of state control. This evening, police withdrew from the streets of Belgrade. Outside the Federal parliament building, hundreds of thousands gathered for a rally. Vojislav Kostunica appealed to them to stay on the streets and defend democracy. Kostunica said Milosevic took the country into several wars and now wanted to wage a battle against his own people. The crowd chanted "arrest Slobo and let's march onto Beveneary 3rd, to Milosevic's residence. Kostunica advised calm, what he didn't say was what he couldn't, which is where exactly Slobodan Milosevic is. He hasn't been seen or heard from in the past 24 hours. For The World, this is Nenad Chebeck in Belgrade.

At the White House today, President Clinton said the Serbs, quote,"are trying to get their country back" and that Americans hope they do. The opposition candidate who according to all unbiased reports clearly won the election obviously has, also has, strong differences with us. This is not a question of whether he agrees with us. All we want for the Serbian people is what we want for people everywhere, the right to freely choose their own leaders. That's President Clinton speaking earlier today at the White House. Alexa Gelus is a public policy scholar at the Woodrow Wilson Center in Washington DC. Mr. Gelus, you are a Serb historian. I wonder if you can shed some light on what's happening for us. Do you believe that what we are seeing today is a revolution? It's not a revolution in the sense that there is no violence. But it is revolution in the sense that large masses of people seem to be firmly determined to overthrow and change the regime and that Serbia deep in his heart has decided that they want to have democratic society. So what's the strategy as you see it at work. Why are the protesters attacking the parliament building? I mean, why are they confronting the President? I think it is symbolic, you know, they are attacking, you know, seats of power and so on. I mean they are not attacking parliament because they are opposed to parliamentarians, on the contrary, you know, they want democracy. I mean they are symbolic gestures. They are throwing, for example, Milosevic pictures out of the parliament. They know where the President is presumably. Why aren't they going to see him at his official residence or at the palace? Well, you see first of all it is not very likely that at the moment he is in that palace or residence. He is probably in some secret bunker where he was for example during the NATO bombing. And secondly Milosevic lives in a residential area, right, with rather narrow streets and removed from the center of Belgrade. So it's not so easy to get there, you know. It is relatively easy for police to block the access, either to his private house or to his residence. I think this is the main reason. If he lives in the center of Belgrade, I am certain that they would be storming his house. Do you think the Serbs have it in their minds to see that Milosevic gets out unharmed? Do you think that there is a possibility that they have in mind, Chouchescu type firing squad into this? Well, I would guess that this moment when people are really very angry there are some people who would wish for Milosevic and his followers, the fate of Chouchescu, the Romanian dictator and his wife but majority of people would be against it, you see. The opposition is, in general is adamant that they are against violence, that they are against revenge, against killing and so on. And also if you look at Milosevic's 13 years of rule in Serbia, I mean he repressed media. He intimidated political opponent, bribed them. He often did not respect law. But he had not engaged in large-scale violence or repression inside Serbia itself, also over Bosnia and Croatia, these are different questions. So, in that sense, I don't think, I would not think that majority of Serbs would want Milosevic killed. How does Milosevic get out of this? Well, with some difficulty. I think the way for Milosevic now is simply to accept the defeat and in return to demand from the opposition that he is not persecuted nor extradited to The Hague and simply withdraw to private life. I don't think there is any other solution for him at the moment. Well, of course nobody knows exactly what he is thinking right now, but is he the type of leader, based on some of his past actions, to think that he can withstand even this kind of feverish opposition? One of his kind of quality, if you can call it a quality, he has very strong nerves so it is difficult to spook him and he can remain under great pressure for a long time. We witnessed that during NATO bombing, but at the same time he is, how shall I put it, may be his strategy is irrational right. His whole view of politics is in deep conflict with the values of modern democracy. But at the same time on a day-to-day basis he is not an irrational politician. He is a rational, pragmatic politician, who calculates, who tries to a find a way out and so on. He is not a mad man as some people see him right and so I think that ultimately these instinct of self preservation and rational calculation will prevail. Alexa Gelus is a public policy scholar at the Woodrow Wilson Center in Washington DC. Thank you very much. Thank you.

Milosevic got even more bad news today from Montenegro, Serbia's last remaining partner in Yugoslavia. As spokesman for Milosevic's Socialist Party there said, the party had not yet decided whether to take part in further presidential voting. The government of Montenegro is pro-western and in fact boycotted last month's election claiming it was illegal. To find out the mood of ordinary citizens and the Republic, we turn to The World's Jennifer Glass in the capital Podgorica. The people of Montenegro are watching what's happening in Belgrade closely. The only sound on the streets that anything is going on is increased security around the government buildings. Montenegro's Deputy Prime Minister Dragesa Borzon says that's just a precaution, incase Slobodan Milosevic tries to make a last move. He might try in desperation to put up flame here somehow and there is some mood among officers here, but prevailing mood among army people here is not to try that and that gives me a hope that we may escape after 13 years of these horrible developments, that he will escape without conflict. But what form Montenegro would take is still in question. There is a strong independent movement. Borzon says, in some ways it will become weaker if and when Milosevic goes because he was a common enemy. The man who would replace him, Vojislav Kostunica has said he wants Montenegro to remain part of Yugoslavia, but he has not said what rights the Republic would have. Montenegro historically regards its sister Republic Serbia with suspicion. In the town of Cetinje, Montenegro's former capital, locals point to a building that was the Serbian embassy at the beginning of the 20th century, proof they say that Montenegro was independent of Serbia and will be again. Part of any future separation from Serbia may like the other splits in the Balkans be driven by religion. In an office on a hillside, orthodox priest Mikilo Dadivic calls himself the Metropolitan of the Montenegrin Orthodox Church, which he says has a right to be free of the Serbian church. Serbia does not recognize Montenegro as an independent state he says and the Serb Orthodox Church does not recognize the Montenegrin Orthodox Church as independent. He says they see Montenegro as a region. Once it was a region of their great Serbia, now it's a region of their small Serbia. Dadivic says the Montenegrin church lost its independence from Serbia in the 1920s, but the Government's Minister of Religion Vladimir Duboc denies the Montenegrin church was ever independent and says there is one church here. Orthodox Church was always a factor of gathering the cohesion. So it was not a factor of division that's why I do not consider that we have separate churches here. In Montenegro there is only one church and it is Serbian Orthodox. He says Dadivic has no authority to try and split the Orthodox Church, but no one will stop him. I don't think that term 'rebels' can be used because they are not rebels. They have the absolute right to express their religious belief, but they cannot claim for what is not theirs. But Dadivic claims that more than 600 churches in Montenegro controlled by the Serbs should be turned over to Montenegrins. Setinya's monastery, less than a mile from his office, is run by the Serbian Orthodox Church. The priests here won't talk about the church division. The elderly nun running the souvenir shop was happy too. I asked what she thought of the idea of the Montenegrin church taking over the monastery? She dismissed the possibility. They can't bother us, she says. The Montenegrin Orthodox Church is not even a real church. Then a large man in civilian clothes told her to be quiet. No interviews, no comment, no information he said. Montenegrins accused the Serbian Orthodox Church of rewriting history to keep this Republic's church under its control. Rewriting history, changing the rules, just like they say Milosevic is doing in Belgrade now. Perhaps the simple fact that the turmoil there has hardly touched life here, it is a sign of how much independence Montenegro already has. For The World, I am Jennifer Glass in Podgorica.

Presidential candidates George W. Bush and Al Gore agreed Thursday that Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic must heed protesters' calls that he step down. Bush, deviating from an education speech at a public school near Detroit, said it was ``clear the people have spoken. It is time for Mr. Milosevic to go.'' Later, he told a Wisconsin audience that Milosevic ``needs to go.'' In Belgrade, Yugoslavia, protesters took control of the parliament Thursday, angry that Milosevic won't accept electoral defeat. Bush, the Republican candidate, said the protesters were acting out of frustration and ``took matters into their own hands.'' ``Our country must work closely with our allies in Europe, the international community including Russia, to pressure Mr. Milosevic to leave office,'' Bush said. ``The world will be a better place when he hears the word of his people and leaves his office.'' Bush's running mate, Dick Cheney, in Kentucky for Thursday night's vice presidential debate, said, ``You keep your fingers crossed and hope it works out all right and democracy triumphs.'' Asked what the role of the United States should be, Cheney a former secretary of defense, said, ``Find out for sure what's going on. You always make sure you've got good information.'' Gore, the Democratic candidate, said he felt ``in some ways joyful'' at the sight of revolutionaries in Yugoslavia, but said the joy was tempered by the ``volatile situation'' in Belgrade. ``It is obviously time for Milosevic to get out of power. One way or another he is going to leave power because what we have seen is the power of people who vote to express themselves in a decisive way,'' Vice President Gore said in Grand Rapids, Mich. ``We call upon Milosevic to get out of power,'' he added. ``It will be taken from him if he does not, because the people of Serbia have spoken, and now they're rising up.'' Though Gore sympathized with the Yugoslav protesters, who staged the most violent revolts Milosevic has seen during his 13-year rule, the vice president said U.S. troops should not be involved. ``This is an expression of democracy by the people of Serbia and their will is not to be denied,'' Gore said. ``This is the kind of situation that we saw over and over again when the Berlin Wall came down. It is the people feeling their right to self-determination, and he has to yield, he has to leave.'' Gore's running mate, Joseph Lieberman, said, ``The people of Yugoslavia have made it clear first at the ballot box and now in the streets that they want freedom and democracy in their country. Milosevic's tyranny must end.'' During Tuesday's presidential debate, Gore was quick to seize on Bush when he said Russians might have the ``sway'' to persuade Milosevic to leave office. Russian President Vladimir Putin invited Milosevic and his rival to Moscow for talks to resolve the dispute. But Gore said Putin's unwillingness to recognize the election results was troubling. ``I'm not sure that it's right for us to invite the president of Russia to mediate this dispute there, because we might not like the result that comes out of that,'' Gore said. Despite Gore's suggestion that involving the Russians could backfire given Moscow's past support for Milosevic, Bush made clear in his Michigan remarks that he believed the Russians had an important role to play. Asked on Thursday to comment on Bush's statement that Russians should be called in to assist, Gore said, ``I'm not going to get back into that. This is not a moment for politics.'' ``It is a moment for all the world to stand with the people of Serbia,'' Gore said. Bush, in his later question-and-answer session at a school in Appleton, Wis., noted that he had supported President Clinton's decision to confront Milosevic militarily in 1999. ``I supported the president in Kosovo because I thought it was in our vital national interest to keep a strong NATO ... I was worried that an unchecked Milosevic would destabilize NATO, which would affect our vital national interests.''

Thousands of immigrants fled Ivory Coast on Thursday, fearful of being targeted by civil unrest if opposition leaders are barred from presidential elections. Immigrants from neighboring West African countries and Muslims from northern Ivory Coast are the primary support base of the main opposition candidate, Alassane Dramane Ouattara, who is expected to be excluded from the vote. Some Ouattara supporters have warned of civil unrest if he is excluded and junta officials have countered with threats of harsh reprisals for any violence. Junta leader Gen. Robert Guei struck a conciliatory note in an address to the nation Thursday, but warned he intended to act with ``a firm hand'' during this ``sensitive period.'' ``Dear foreign sisters and brothers, it is legitimate that the life of the country that received you should interest you,'' Guei said. ``But you must refrain from taking part in the jousts of national politics. They do not concern you.'' The U.S. State Department announced it was sending Ambassador Nancy Powell, the No. 2 official in the African affairs bureau, to the Ivory Coast to underscore the grave U.S. concern about developments in that country. Powell will meet Friday with Gen. Robert Guei, leader the governing junta in Ivory Coast, said department spokesman Philip Reeker. Meanwhile, immigrant families converged on bus stations in Abidjan's potholed, polluted working-class neighborhood of Adjame, seeking to leave ahead of a weekend state of emergency and curfew announced Thursday by the junta. At one station, surrounded by car-sized potholes filled with foul-smelling mud, hundreds of immigrants from Mali squatted among rice sacks and flimsy bags of clothing. ``I have sick parents to think about, so I am afraid,'' said Mohammed Cisse, 24, who along with his parents and younger brother had been waiting since dawn to get places on a bus to Mali. ``The situation is dangerous in Ivory Coast and I don't want my parents to be here if it gets worse.'' At a nearby bus station, where state television said a bomb exploded late Wednesday, killing four people, anxious immigrants waited while a damaged vehicle was repaired. State television reported the device exploded in the hands of the assailants as they were planting it, but there was no independent confirmation of the account. Some witnesses said the victims included vendors who had nothing to do with the bomb. ``One of my friends was killed and he was not a bomber _ he sold sacks,'' said Abou Tiote, a bus station laborer. The Supreme Court is expected to announce by Saturday who can run against Guei, who has insisted he will run despite international calls to step down. After seizing power in Ivory Coast's first coup d'etat on Dec. 24, Guei initially promised a quick handover to civilians. But he has since traded his military uniform for a suit and tie and has rallied several small political parties around his candidacy. He promised Thursday to ``respect on every point the will of the people and to suffer no stalling tactics,'' but noted that foreigners were forbidden in Ivory Coast to ``lust after the highest responsibilities of state.'' Adding to the growing tensions were a series of arrests in a Sept. 18 shooting outside Guei's home. Nearly all those taken into custody were soldiers, most of them northerners thought to be at odds with regime. At least 30 were tortured and at least two died, two soldiers familiar with the torture sessions told Daniel Balint-Kurti of Dow Jones Newswires. The soldiers, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said one man was covered in a mattress and burned alive, and others were forced to crawl beneath barbed wire hung low to the ground, shredding the skin on their backs. Salt was then poured on the wounds, the soldiers said. The junta, which says the shooting was an attempt to assassinate Guei, has denied torturing or killing the dozens of suspects arrested in the incident. Some disaffected soldiers see the arrests that followed the shooting as an army purge of northerners suspected of sympathy with Ouattara. The junta contends Ouattara, a former International Monetary Fund deputy managing director and Ivory Coast prime minister, cannot run for president because one of his parents was born outside the country. Ouattara says both his parents are Ivorian. The debate over his eligibility has solidified Guei's support among southerners who have long dominated Ivory Coast's political arena, while hardening the defiance of northerners. The leader of the former ruling Democratic Party of Ivory Coast, Emile Constant Bombey, is also expected to be barred from running. The junta has accused him of corruption. The December coup shook Ivory Coast's standing as a stable financial and political power. The country has Africa's third-largest economy, dependent on exports of coffee and cocoa.

Mobs seeking to topple Slobodan Milosevic turned their fury on his centers of power Thursday, leaving parliament and other key Belgrade sites in shambles and flames. The 13-year rule of the Yugoslav president appeared to have collapsed. Opposition leader Zoran Djindjic said Milosevic was holed up near the eastern town of Bor, some 50 miles southeast of the capital, near the border with Romania and Bulgaria. He said Milosevic had not been in touch with the opposition camp. ``As of today, Serbia is again a democratic nation,'' declared an opposition leader, Nebojsa Covic, referring to Yugoslavia's main republic. ``It belongs to all of us, to Europe and to the world.'' By nightfall the crowd's fury was spent as the symbols of Milosevic's power __ police stations, state media __ had fallen to the opposition. Huge crowds wandered the streets and gathered in the squares celebrating their apparent victory. Opposition leaders, including some former senior military officers, appealed to the armed forces to support their candidate, Vojislav Kostunica. State media said that army commanders were meeting in Belgrade early Friday and that a statement was expected. Djindjic said shortly before dawn Friday that he felt ``the critical period'' overnight when Milosevic military could have counterattacked against the opposition supporters ``was over.'' On Thursday, hundreds of thousands of people swarmed through the capital to demand that Milosevic accept his apparent electoral defeat by Kostunica in the Sept. 24 election. The uprising developed with stunning speed, swelling as security forces showed little willingness to battle the largest anti-Milosevic protest ever. Some police who did fire on demonstrators were beaten, as was the director of Serbian state television, Dragoljub Milanovic, one of Milosevic's closest allies. He was punched, kicked and pummeled with sticks as he tried to flee the television station. The government's Tanjug news agency, which defected to the opposition, said two people were killed and 65 injured in the rioting. All but 12 of the injured were treated and released from hospitals, Tanjug said. Many police put down their clubs and joined flag-waving crowds as they surged across central Belgrade through clouds of tear gas. As demonstrators charged and riot police cowered behind helmets and shields, the federal parliament building, the state broadcasting center and police stations fell in quick succession. Protesters tossed documents and portraits of Milosevic through the broken windows of the parliament complex. Smoke billowed from the building and from the state television headquarters nearby. Elsewhere in the country, thousands more people joined smaller rallies in a number of towns. ``What we are doing today is making history,'' Kostunica proclaimed during an evening speech in front of Belgrade city hall, across from parliament. The opposition's domino-like successes did not fully erase fear that Milosevic could strike back. ``The most critical moments are not over,'' said Vuk Obradovic, a former general turned opposition leader. ``It is very important that people stay in the streets.'' Kostunica asked supporters continue demonstrating until dawn to try to block any possible counterattack by the military. Tens of thousands were still heeding his call as dawn approached Friday, roaming the streets in impromptu celebrations. Kostunica also appealed to people from the countryside to stream into Belgrade for rallies Friday. ``We call on the military and police to do everything to ensure a peaceful transition of power,'' he said. The crowd chanted for Milosevic's arrest. Kostunica answered: ``He doesn't need to be arrested. He arrested himself a long time ago.'' At the White House, President Clinton said: ``The people are trying to get their country back.'' British Prime Minister Tony Blair said of Milosevic: ``Your time is up. Go now.'' Commenting on the possibility that Milosevic could strike back, National Security Adviser Sandy Berger said: ``There are a lot of rumors swirling around and I would take them all with a certain grain of salt at this point. Again, we have no reason at this stage to believe that he's not still in Serbia.'' A statement from Milosevic's Socialist Party of Serbia in the early hours of the clashes said it would ``fight against violence and destruction'' with ``all its force and in all state institutions.'' No further statement was made. A former Yugoslav army chief of staff, retired Gen. Momcilo Perisic, appealed to the armed forces to support the democratic forces. He said what was left of the police force had already agreed not to attack people ``unless they break into public buildings and cause damage.'' ``I talked to the army leaders and they promised not to intervene,'' Perisic said without elaborating. Perisic said, however, that Milosevic and his allies are ``determined'' and there remains a chance they might be planning a counterattack from somewhere ``outside Belgrade.'' During an interview on state television, Kostunica said he envisions a democratic Serbia that has normal relations with other countries and does not suffer under diplomatic sanctions. The United States and the European Union have imposed sanctions against the Milosevic regime for several years. But French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine said France, which holds the rotating EU presidency, is ``taking the necessary steps'' for the EU to reconsider the sanctions as soon as Monday. The collapse of Milosevic's institutions in Belgrade was extraordinary. As clashes spread through the capital, the streets echoed with the sound of stun grenades and tear gas fired in an unsuccessful attempt to break up the crowds. Later, both state television channels went off the air before coming back on under opposition control, and the state-run Tanjug news agency _ one of chief pillars of Milosevic's rule _ announced it is no longer loyal to him. ``From this moment, Tanjug informs the Yugoslav public that it is with the people of this country,'' a statement carried by the agency said. Another Tanjug report referred to Kostunica as ``President-elect of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.'' The conquest of the parliament was highly symbolic. But the loss of the state media and the government-run newspaper Politika was a bigger blow to Milosevic, denying him his biggest propaganda tools. The Yugoslav military remained in its barracks and it was unclear whether the army remained loyal to Milosevic, but his security forces appeared to be disintegrating, with protesters seizing police precincts without a fight. The level of defiance was unprecedented in Yugoslavia's 55-year communist history. ``They're giving up,'' said a demonstrator who identified himself only as Sasha. The government acknowledges that Kostunica won more votes than Milosevic, but says he fell short of a majority in the five-candidate race. A runoff had been set for Sunday. The president has already countered in the courts in an apparent bid to cling to power: The Milosevic-controlled Yugoslav Constitutional Court issued a decision Wednesday that Tanjug said nullified ``parts'' of the election. The ruling outraged opposition supporters, who had brought the case in hopes Kostunica would be declared the winner. Hundreds of thousands of people broke through police convoys and streamed into Belgrade for Thursday's opposition rally, and the melees erupted as the rally was beginning. One attempt to storm parliament was repulsed by tear gas, but following waves of protesters broke through. By late afternoon, opposition supporters who had been inside the parliament building were climbing through the windows and onto the complex's balconies, waving flags as the crowd roared below. Inside the building, chaos reigned. Gangs of young people, many of them intoxicated, roamed the building, smashing furniture and computers and looting what valuables they could carry. But police offered little resistance and the clashes ebbed. Afterward, as night fell, thousands of demonstrators walked the streets in a relatively relaxed atmosphere. Some were drunk and brandishing handguns. Many protesters wore paper caps with the slogan, ``We'll Endure.'' They moved past shops, some shut down with signs stating, ``Closed because of Robbery'' _ an allusion to opposition claims that Milosevic stole the elections. Several shop windows were shattered, and by evening orange flames still billowed from part of the parliament building. Big trucks with loudspeakers drove through Belgrade blasting folk and rock music. The downtown headquarters of the Yugoslav Left, the neo-communist party run by Milosevic's wife, was demolished, with the graffiti ``People's Revolution'' sprayed on inside walls. More than 100,000 people gathered in front of parliament before Kostunica's evening speech. Protesters _ from burly farmers to black-robed Serbian Orthodox priests _ waved Yugoslav flags outside the building. The crowd chanted ``Kill him! Kill him!'' as opposition leaders claimed victory over Milosevic. ``At this moment, terror rules in Belgrade,'' state television said in a commentary earlier, before a bulldozer broke into its headquarters and the opposition took it over. ``They are attacking everyone they see on the streets and there is chaos.''

An exultant Secretary of State Madeleine Albright welcomed Russia's decision to back Yugoslav opposition leader Vojislav Kostunica after long years of support for ousted President Slobodan Milosevic. ``This is great news,'' Albright said Friday, giving a thumbs up, after receiving word of the Russian action as she carried out a series of morning television interviews. Even though there has been no formal transfer of power in Yugoslavia, she referred to Kostunica as ``President Kostunica.'' She said she had no information on Milosevic's whereabouts but another official said there was some evidence that he might be at a retreat near Yugoslavia's border with Romania. ``The Russian recognition of President Kostunica is very, very important because they have always had a very special relationship with the Serbian people,'' Albright told CNN. ``We are very glad that Russia has now joined the rest of Europe and us in congratulating the victory of President Kostunica.'' She said sanctions will be lifted against Yugoslavia ``as soon as it's clear that Kostunica is in and Milosevic is out.'' She added that the United States and its European allies will give assistance to the new Yugoslavia ``so that it can be reconstructed and they can have the normal life that the rest of ... the Balkans are beginning to have.'' On Thursday, President Clinton also talked about a return to normal relations with Yugoslavia. Once democracy is restored, he said, ``We will move as quickly as possible to lift the sanctions and build the kind of responsible partnership that the people there deserve.'' He spoke after hundreds of thousands of people swarmed through the Yugoslav capital of Belgrade to demand that Milosevic accept his apparent defeat by Kostunica in the Sept. 24 election. Rumors swirled that Milosevic had fled Yugoslavia, but Clinton's national security adviser, Sandy Berger, said Thursday evening, ``At this stage we have no reason to believe he is not in Belgrade. I don't think anybody knows what his intention is.'' Berger said Milosevic was ``perfectly capable of trying to make a last stand. I think that the pillars of his power that have kept him in power _ his control of the security forces, his control of the state media, the cronies around him _ I think all of those pillars are crumbling.'' Senators urged Yugoslavia's armed forces and Russian officials to get on the side of the opposition. ``We have played a positive role and I think it's time for the Russians to be more constructive,'' said Sen. Sam Brownback, R-Kan. ``They need to step up and recognize the opposition leadership and encourage the military to stay in the barracks.'' Sen. Rod Grams, R-Minn., a member of Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said he supports transition assistance for Yugoslavia. ``Help in those first days (of a new government) could be important,'' said Grams. Clinton administration officials have acknowledged spending millions of dollars over the past year to support the Serbian opposition, independent radio, human rights groups and others working for democracy in Yugoslavia. But they have denied that any money went to the presidential campaign of opposition leaders. Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del., also a Foreign Relations Committee member, said it is important that Serb opposition get credit for their own efforts against Milosevic and not be seen as instruments of the United States or other international opponents of Milosevic. ``We have to be cautious,'' Biden said. ``It is critically important that Kostunica be viewed as independent of any outside source and a product of the world of the Serbian people.'' Biden has introduced a Senate resolution saying that if Kostunica became president, the United States would lift sanctions, immediately and then incrementally ``to help bring the Serbian people and the Serbian government back into the family of nations.'' ___ On the Net: State Department background on Serbia and Montenegro: http://www.state.gov/www/background_notes/serbia_9908_bgn.html

The European Union will start dismantling its sanctions against Yugoslavia next week if the Serbian opposition manages to consolidate the success of its uprising against President Slobodan Milosevic, EU officials said Friday. The EU foreign ministers, who are to meet in Luxembourg, are expected to lift an oil embargo against Serbia, permanently remove a ban on commercial flights to and from Yugoslavia, and ease financial restrictions on Serb companies. ``If Vojislav Kostunica takes office over this weekend, then sanctions against Serbia will go on Monday when the European foreign ministers meet,'' British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said in an interview with London's Sky Television News. However, EU officials stressed that it was too early to lift all sanctions, even if opposition leader Kostunica is confirmed in power. The U.N.-imposed arms embargo can be ended only by a Security Council resolution. The EU's asset freeze on Milosevic's friends and family, and its visa ban on Milosevic's entourage are expected to stay. ``We don't want a situation where some of the worst elements of the regime can get the money they've salted away and take it out of Serbia,'' said EU External Affairs Commissioner Chris Patten. Monday's meeting is also expected to consider freeing up some $2 billion in economic aid that the EU had earmarked for Serbia over the next seven years, in case Milosevic was thrown out. Patten played down concerns that handing over the aid could be complicated by Kostunica's declared resistance to cooperation with the international war crimes tribunal in the Hague, Netherlands. ``I don't think at this stage we should be starting to imagine circumstances where it will be difficult to work with Serbia,'' Patten told journalists in Brussels by live television link from Edinburgh, Scotland. EU foreign ministers promised last month that they would lift sanctions if Kostunica defeated Milosevic in Yugoslavia's Sept. 24 elections. The 15-nation bloc delayed acting, however, as Milosevic refused to stand aside and demanded a runoff vote against Kostunica, who secured the most votes in the election. The EU imposed sanctions in response to Milosevic's repression of the opposition in Serbia and the crackdown by Yugoslav troops in Kosovo province, which provoked last year's NATO bombing campaign against Serbia.

good evening. it took the angry voices of hundreds of thousands of people protesting for days, but tonight slobodan milosevic finally admitted he is no longer the president of yugoslavia, and he said he had just received at information. it followed a day of intense behind-the-scenes negotiation to decide his future and the future of the country. for now, it seems the new regime of president kostunica is not insisting milosevic leave the country. abc's bob woodruff is in belgrade tonight. in a surprise live speech tonight, slobodan milosevic conceded his loss and congratulated his oppone. i, myself, am relieved by the enormous responsibility i have borne for a whole decade. i plan to rest a bit and spend time with my family. after that, to help my party gain force and contribute to the future of the country. on the streets on the second day of the revolution, the people of yugoslavia are savoring their victory, swept up by the sudden death of their dictatorship. belgrade has become one big party. while the people celebrated, slobodan milosevic reappeared in beg grade in a videotaped meeting. russia's foreign minister had come to tell him that the russians no longer are behind him and he should accept defeat. sources say milosevic was defiant, promising to stay in yugoslavia and in politics. the people here say, their new president, vojislav kostunica, is quickly becoming a populist leader. today he, too, met with russia's foreign minister, who carried the russian's president endorsement. and tonight he went on national television to take direct questions from the viewers -- something milosevic never dared to do. disdain for milosevic seems to be growing. yesterday's uprising was targeted mostly at him. the crowds focused much of their anger on anything associated with milosevic. this is the local party headquarters of milosevic's wife. as you can see, every window is broken and the building is trashed. the mob also singled out and destroyed the store owned by milosevic's son. they burned the tv station that carried milosevic's words and beat the station's director. but tonight, the people seem to be turning away from anger, praying instead for a better future. a future and a country without slobodan milosevic. bob woodruff, belgrade.

good evening, everyone. upheaval in two of the world's most troubled places tonight. the middle east andoslavia. the scenes could hardly be more different n. yugoslavia, slobodan milosevic has finally con creeded defeat in last month's election. in the middle east, muslim protesters have declared a day of rage, clashing with israeli troops and police across the west bank and gaza, culminating in a battle in jrm jrm. eight splinz been killed today, bringing the total dead to 77. more on that situation in a moment. first what appears to be the transfer of power in yugoslavia. two reports beginning with nbc's jim maceda in belgrade. jubilant but exhausted serbs today picking up the pieces of their revolution. day one of what was, until yesterday, unthinkable -- a life not ruled by slobodan milosevic. happy, happy, happy, happy. "he stole everything from us," says this man. "our houses, our land. thank god we are now free." even milosevic, finally conceding defeat, appearing on serb tv, congratulating vojislav kostunica for his victory, saying he would spend more time with the family. some serbs celebrating their victory near the scarred remains of police vehicles, trashed by protesters. yesterday's uprising was perhaps the easy part. now, a whole nation of serbs must figure out what democracy is and how to govern in the void left by milosevic. president-elect kostunica under pressure at home and abroad to deliver, helped today by promises from the west that sanctions could be lifted as early as next week. there was more good news. the constitutional court confirming his electoral victory and a pledge from the yugoslav army that it would obey his authority. and in a massive show of support, over 200,000 in the streets, to attend kostunica's inauguration, but the ceremony postponed. instead, a rock concert, followed by an orthodox church blessing. sources saying kostunica has other priorities, like what to do with milosevic. to that end, russian envoy igor ivanov, in belgrade today, meeting first with kostunica, then visiting milosevic at his residence -- the first sign of the yugoslav leader since the opposition takeover. in comments to reporters after those talks, ivanov suggests milosevic wants to remain a force in national serbian politics. "no way," say those on yesterday's front lines. it's over. he's an ordinary citizen now. their revolution behind them, serbs now hoping that life after 13 years of wars and hardship under milosevic can finally get back to normal. jim maceda, nbc news, belgrade. this is andrea mitchell in washington, where officials celebrate the opposition's victory, but despite milosevic's concession, still worry about him. the president calls the outcome astonishing, congratulates kostunica, but rejects any suggestion that milosevic stay or, even worse, have an official political role in yugoslavia. i think it would be a terrible mistake for him to remain active in the political life of his country. that is not what the people voted for. the u.s. spent $36 million over the last two years supporting the opposition. but can their victory stand? that could depend on whether russia is giving milosevic false hope of a political comeback. in moscow today, milosevic's brother -- says his brother will not flee, will stay. that, says a former russian foreign minister, is trouble. he is still a dangerous animal, though wounded, like they say in such cases. the next big question -- war crimes. milosevic and his circle indicted for atrocities in kosovo. today, the prosecutor says she's ready for him. i am prepared to receive mr. milosevic in the hague at any time. but that is unlikely. a key milosevic general, ratko mladic, accused of genocide in bosnia five years ago, lives openly in belgrade. and another indicted war criminal, radovan karadzic, also still free. yugoslavia's new leader refuses to turn milosevic or the others over. it's extremely important for the future of yugoslavia that they be held accountable and that justice be done. but justice takes time. tonight, the president is talking to european leaders about ways to lift economic sanctions on yugoslavia as early as monday as a strong show of support for the new government. andrea mitchell, nbc news, at the state department.

big news tonight from big sky country. a remarkable discovery. the largest number of t-rex die saudi arabia fossils found. nbc's bob faw reports on the dig for prehistoric magic and the man leading the hunt. that other jack horner might have been sitting in a corner but this jack horner, a paleontologist at the museum of the rockies, has been digging and finding five tyrannosaurus rex fossils in the badlands of eastern montana. t-rexes are found about one every ten years or so. and the fact that we found this many of them either means they were more common than we thought, or we're just really lucky. as depicted in the film jurassic park, it truly was "king of the tyrant lizards" -- 40 feet long weighing up to eight tons almost 20 feet tall, when rearing up. living almost 70 million years ago, with teeth six inches long in its fearsome jaws and razor sharp claws, the largest meat-eating dinosaur could rip off and devour huge chunks of flesh. one of the new fossils found by horner's wife, celeste and named "c-rex" in her honor, may be ,10% bigger in fact than the mighty "sue," that t-rex found in south dakota and auctioned off 3 years ago to chicago's field museum of natural history for $8.36 million. that won't happen to the new fossils since they were found on federal land, a national wildlife refuge, they belong to the american people. that's part of the mystery and the excitement of this discovery. maybe he will find out why the five were together. still buried deep below the surface, encased in tons of rock, the "new" fossils will be unearthed next summer. mysteries about t-rex could finally be resolved. maybe we'll actually be able to see them losing their arms. are their arms getting shorter, or their ability to run decreasing through time? stuff that's really interesting. "stuff" that perhaps will be fully understood now, almost 70 million years later. bob faw, nbc news, washington. for friday.

Moving quickly to show support for Yugoslavia's opposition leader, Vojislav Kostunica, the European Union announced Friday that its foreign ministers would meet Monday to begin lifting sanctions imposed on the country in 1999. The decision, coming much sooner than many had expected, will begin to make good on a September promise to reward the Yugoslavs if they ousted President Slobodan Milosevic in the Sept. 24 elections. In a brief statement that echoed those from leaders across Western Europe, President Jacques Chirac of France, which holds the current rotating presidency of the 15-nation union, congratulated the people of Yugoslavia on liberating themselves first with a vote ``and then in the street'' when it seemed their victory ``might be stolen from them.'' As president of France and the leader of the union, Chirac officially recognized Kostunica as the new president of Yugoslavia. ``Today I salute President Kostunica,'' he said, ``and I confirm that sanctions will be lifted with the return of democracy.'' Sealing the ready approval with which the new leader of Yugoslavia is being welcomed by a world weary of Milosevic's brutality, Chirac also invited Kostunica to attend a summit meeting of European Union leaders scheduled late next week in Biarritz, France. In Germany, a spokesman for Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder said he had canceled all his engagements Friday to follow developments in Yugoslavia _ an indication of the gravity with which events are viewed across a continent on which Milosevic's reign represented the last scourge of communist rule. European Union officials said that barring any sudden changes in Yugoslavia, the foreign ministers would probably lift an oil embargo and a flight ban immediately. But lifting the other two sanctions _ financial restrictions that have affected the majority of the country's larger companies and a ban on visas for Milosevic, his family and close associates might take more time. It is not clear what the future holds for Milosevic, who on Friday night appeared on Yugoslav television and congratulated Kostunica on winning the presidential elections, but seemed to envision a future for himself that would still involve a role in Yugoslavia's politics. In the light of Milosevic's indictment on charges of war crimes, that would be difficult for the West to tolerate, and would probably complicate Kostunica's efforts to introduce real democracy to Yugoslavia. ``Nobody would want to fetch up in a situation in which some of those who were most guilty for what has happened in the last few years, who were most guilty for cheating the Serbian people, were able to disappear with their loot to some warm clime,'' said Chris Patten, who as external relations commissioner for the European Union has handled many of the bloc's policies toward Yugoslavia. Patten said the union would move swiftly to bolster the relief assistance it has already provided in much smaller quantities, and with great difficulty, to isolated Yugoslav cities governed by the opposition to Milosevic. Yugoslavia is coping with hundreds of thousands of Yugoslav refugees from the wars that Milosevic lost in Croatia, Bosnia and Kosovo, and the general standard of living in Yugoslavia has plummeted in recent years. The European Commission, working with opposition economists, has estimated that Yugoslavia, which consists of Serbia and the small republic of Montenegro, needs about $4 billion to rebuild itself over seven years. The European Union is considering contributing about half that amount. The apparent downfall of Milosevic could either speed the greater integration of the Balkan peninsula with the rest of Europe, or emphasize the continent's effective division into two Europes, with the southeastern part a region of unstable and impoverished countries lagging far behind wealthier Central and Western Europe. Many questions remain about whether the European Union will come up with the support it has talked of offering to the Balkans. Already, Western Europe is struggling with how and when it will integrate nearly a dozen countries that appear to have the economic credentials to join the union within the decade. Speaking in Poland on Friday, Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain took his turn at tackling the subject of the future of Europe, saying that the ``hand of partnership'' had to be held out to the Yugoslavian people. Enlargement, he said, had to come soon. Without it, he said, ``Western Europe will always be faced with the threat of instability, conflict and mass migration on its borders.'' ``Without enlargement,'' he added, ``the political consensus behind economic and political reform in the weaker transition countries may splinter.'' Blair offered yet another model of what shape the European Union should take. In May, Germany's foreign minister, Joschka Fischer, suggested that a European federation with a directly elected president and a parliament sharing real executive and legislative powers was needed. A month later, Chirac suggested a far looser structure, a ``united Europe of states rather than a United States of Europe,'' where some countries could forge ahead and cooperate on matters that other countries were not interested in. Blair on Friday called for a ``statement of principles'' agreed to by all members, which would define what should be governed at a European level and what would be decided nationally. He also suggested a second chamber of the European Parliament, comprising representatives of national parliaments, to oversee common European foreign and security policy. ``The most important challenge is for Europe to wake up to the new reality,'' he said. ``Europe is widening and deepening simultaneously. There will be more of us in the future, trying to do more.''

Bowing to a vast popular revolt against him, a pale Slobodan Milosevic resigned Friday night as Yugoslavia's president, ending 13 years of rule that have brought his country four wars, international isolation, a NATO bombing campaign and his own indictment on war crimes charges. Vojislav Kostunica, a 56-year-old constitutional lawyer of quiet habits and a firm belief in a future for Yugoslavia as a normal country within Europe, is expected to be inaugurated Saturday. An already exuberant and chaotic Belgrade, celebrating its extraordinary day of revolution on Thursday, exploded with noise as the news of Milosevic's resignation, made in a short speech on television, quickly spread. Cars blasted their horns; people banged on pots and pans from balconies, blew whistles and danced in the street. Milosevic appeared on television at about 11:20 p.m. _ shortly after Kostunica announced, on a television phone-in program, that he had met Milosevic and the army chief of staff, Gen. Nebojsa Pavkovic, Friday evening, and that both had congratulated him on his election victory on Sept. 24. The resignation deal was helped along by Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov of Russia, who met with Kostunica and Milosevic Friday. Ivanov was carrying assurances that if Milosevic gave up power now, the world would not press for his extradition to face war crimes charges in The Hague, Netherlands, senior Western officials said Friday night. ``I've just received official information that Vojislav Kostunica won the elections,'' Milosevic said in his television address. ``This decision was made by the body that was authorized to do so under the constitution, and I consider that it has to be respected.'' Milosevic spoke with a straight face after an extraordinary set of manipulations on his part _ of the Federal Election Commission and the highest court in the land _ to deny Kostunica outright victory. Speaking of how important it was for political parties to strengthen themselves in opposition, Milosevic said he intended to continue as leader of the Socialist Party of Serbia after taking a break ``to spend more time with my family, especially my grandson, Marko.'' Despite his brave words, it is unlikely that the Socialist Party, with its own future to consider, will keep Milosevic as its leader for long. The remarks seemed part of a deal to save him a little bit of face. There is deep resentment in this semi-reformed communist party _ Serbia's largest and best organized, which has been in power since World War II _ of Milosevic's indulgence of his wife, Mirjana Markovic, who began her own party, the Yugoslav United Left, called JUL. Ruling in coalition, the Socialists saw more and more of their positions, powers and benefits going to JUL. The reaction in Belgrade was immediate and loud. Tanja Radovic, a 23-year-old student blowing her whistle furiously on Knez Mihailova Street, said: ``He's gone. It's finally true. We had too much of him, it's enough. This is the end of him and all these thieves.'' Dragana Kovac, 31, said: ``I'm happy, and not just because of him, but because of her. He should have spent more time with his family starting 10 years ago.'' Ilija Bobic said: ``I wish all my family were alive to see this. My father used to say that the Communists would finish quickly. He was wrong, but it came true, finally.'' Bobic stopped, then said: ``We all know it won't be better quickly here. But now you can talk. You're not afraid of the phone, of being an enemy inside, of having to join the party to have a job.'' The United States and Europe have promised a quick lifting of international sanctions against Yugoslavia, as well as aid, once Milosevic goes. The sanctions include a toothless oil embargo and a flight ban, currently suspended. But financial sanctions and a visa ban aimed at the Milosevic regime are likely to remain in place for now.

Ousted Yugoslav leader Slobodan Milosevic conceded defeat Friday in presidential elections, a day after protesters angry at him for clinging to power stormed Belgrade's parliament in support of his democratic rival. Milosevic's concession came after a day of statements that helped the president-elect, Vojislav Kostunica, consolidate his power. Yugoslavia's high court named Kostunica the election winner, powerful Yugoslav ally Russia offered its support and the army indicated to the president-elect that it would obey the new political authority. ``I congratulate Mr. Kostunica on his electoral victory and I wish much success to all citizens of Yugoslavia,'' Milosevic said in a television address. ``I intend to rest a bit and spend some more time with my family and especially with my grandson Marko and after that to help my party gain force and contribute to future prosperity.'' The speech signaled that Milosevic has abandoned hopes of blocking Kostunica from taking his oath, possibly Saturday, and instead will try to carve out a role for himself in Yugoslav political life. As an indicted war criminal, Milosevic has little chance of seeking asylum abroad and has no choice but to try to reach an accommodation with the new government. Milosevic's speech triggered a huge celebration on the streets of the Yugoslav capital. Firecrackers were exploding and horns honking throughout the city. A day earlier, hundreds of thousands of people converged on Belgrade in protest of Milosevic's regime. Milosevic started and lost four wars in the Balkans during his 13 years in power, and sanctions imposed by the United Nations, the United States and Europe have left much of Yugoslavia impoverished and isolated. Earlier in the day, Kostunica said he had spoken to Milosevic, though he offered no details. And Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov met with Milosevic at a government villa in Belgrade. Milosevic ``said he intends to play a prominent role in the political life of the country,'' Ivanov said. During the meeting, Milosevic ``stressed the importance of solving the crisis through peaceful ways and that the use of force should be avoided,'' Ivanov told reporters. Milosevic had not been seen since mobs rampaged through the capital Thursday in a display of rage unprecedented in Yugoslavia's 55-year history. The protesters roared through the parliament building and the state broadcasting center. When the violence subsided, it was clear that control belonged to Kostunica. Wild celebrations stretched well into Friday. Other events Friday confirmed the grip of the 56-year-old law professor. Ivanov carried a message from Russian President Vladimir Putin that ``congratulated Mr. Kostunica on his victory in the presidential elections.'' The act removed the last possibility of any important international backing for the fading Milosevic: Russia was the last major European nation to withhold support for Kostunica. ``This is great news,'' said U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who called it ``very, very important.'' Later, in another significant boost, the nation's Constitutional Court notified the anti-Milosevic coalition that it had declared Kostunica the new president-elect. The court, once considered a puppet of Milosevic, killed any legal claim by the former strongman. The speaker of the Serbian parliament, Dragan Tomic, addressed Kostunica as president in a letter. It was the first such recognition by a high official from the Socialist Party of Serbia led by Milosevic. With state media already calling Kostunica ``president'' and his supporters ferreting out Milosevic cronies in state institutions, all that's left is a formal inauguration. Kostunica's aides say that could come as early as Saturday. About 200,000 people gathered in front of the charred parliament Friday. One of their posters read: ``Slobodan, are you counting your last minutes.'' ``We are gradually getting back to normal and I believe the crisis is behind us,'' Kostunica said. Milosevic is blamed by the West for starting _ and then losing _ four Balkan wars which broke out in the last decade when parts of Yugoslavia began to seek independence. Those conflicts were marked by horrific acts of violence against civilians, which prompted Western governments to impose sanctions and isolate Belgrade. Some of those controls were eased after Milosevic signed the 1995 agreement to end the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina. However, other sanctions were imposed again in 1998 after Milosevic launched a brutal crackdown on ethnic Albanians in Kosovo. In the last day, though, both the United States and the European Union have said they will begin to lift sanctions as the new democratic administration takes the reins. French President Jacques Chirac invited Kostunica to join leaders from the 15 EU nations at a summit in the French coastal city of Biarritz on Oct. 13-14. It could offer Kostunica a prime opportunity to seek foreign investment and other aid. But returning Yugoslavia to normal footing may pose its own dilemmas. The sanctions and years of Balkan warfare has left the economy in ruins. Last year's 78-day NATO bombardment hammered an already creaky transportation and utility network. Kostunica was putting together a stop-gap crisis committee to try to stabilize the country. Somehow he will also have to work with close Milosevic allies, such as powerful Serbian President Milan Milutinovic. Like Milosevic, Milutinovic was indicted by the international war crimes tribunal for the offensive against ethnic Albanians in Kosovo. Kostunica could come under strong Western pressure to turn over indicted war criminals. Milosevic's pledge to remain could add even more complications. Officials in Washington were not pleased with the idea of Milosevic remaining on the political scene. They want to see him on trial in The Hague. ``The first step in the process of removing him from power,'' said Sandy Berger, the U.S. national security adviser. ``I would not want to see him playing a role in Serb political affairs.'' Despite the details left to be played out, Western leaders were rejoicing Friday. British Prime Minister Tony Blair said it appeared ``the era of Milosevic is over.'' ``This is the day of real rejoicing in the world and Europe and, most of all, in Serbia,'' he said.

western world leaders are promising to lift sanctions imposed against yugoslavia during milosevic's rule. but there are still unresolved issues involving indicted war criminals in the balkan nation. david ensor reports. eager to show support for the serbian people, western leaders have been quick to promise they will loosen the economic noose around the yugoslav economy. we will move with our european allies to lift sanctions and bring them out of isolation. but the devil may be in the details. no problem for the sanctions imposed over kosovo -- a ban on trade, investment, visas for the elite, a freeze on assets in the u.s. and similar sanctions, along with a flight ban imposed by the european union. those could be lifted within days, officials say. the problem comes with the outer wall of sanctions imposed over bosnia -- things like membership in the world bank and the imf. they are tied to cooperation with the international war crimes tribunal, yet vojislav kostunica says he won't turn slobodan milosevic over to that court. you cannot go after the underlings and indict and imprison them and then let off the top dog. so i think this is a moment of truth, really, for the international community. is it serious about accountability for genocide and war crimes? with the west seeking to reward the serbian people, some analysts expect the u.s. will not press the war crimes issue for now. the probability is that the united states, the u.s. administration will fudge the questions of the war crimes indictment, at least for the near future. u.s. officials insist they will press for indicted war criminals like mr. milosevic to be sent to the hague, although they admit their top priority is to showing support for the new leader in belgrade, even though he refuses to cooperate with that. david ensor, cnn, washington.

Republicans give George W. Bush credit for promoting a Russian role in smoothing the transition from despot to democrat in Yugoslavia _ an idea dismissed in debate as risky by Al Gore even as his boss was trying to get Moscow to step in. It's the first foreign policy spat of an otherwise domestically focused presidential campaign between two candidates who have sharply different views of America's role in the world and a wide gap in foreign policy experience. ``Russians must use their leverage on Mr. Milosevic to make sure he ... finally leaves,'' Bush said Friday in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, repeating what he said in Tuesday's first presidential debate. As he spoke, Russian Foreign Minister Ivanov was in Yugoslavia, meeting with ousted leader Slobodan Milosevic and recognizing opposition leader Vojislav Kostunica as winner of the Sept. 24 election. In the debate, Gore jumped on Bush, dismissing his idea of bringing in the Russians as unwise because they hadn't recognized Kostunica as victor. ``I'm not sure that it's right for us to invite the president of Russia to mediate this dispute there, because we might not like the result that comes out of that,'' Gore said. On Friday, Bush criticized his opponent's statement. ``Either he didn't know what the president was doing or he did know what the president was doing and wasn't willing to share that with the American people,'' Bush said in Florida, where he was campaigning. Gore campaign aides insisted he was aware of administration efforts to persuade the Russians to convince Milosevic to go. In Thursday night's vice presidential debate, as Kostunica supporters stormed Belgrade to drive out Milosevic, Republican Dick Cheney said Gore had been ``pooh-poohing'' the idea of Russian involvement while the administration was doing just about what Bush had proposed. Cheney said Bush deserved ``a lot of credit for that.'' Marc Thiessen, spokesman for the GOP-controlled Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said administration officials told members of Congress in a briefing Wednesday that Clinton sent a letter to Russian President Vladimir Putin three weeks ago ``asking him to step in and do exactly what Bush suggested'' and on Saturday personally urged Putin by phone to intervene. ``It was Bush who was completely informed, whose instincts were right, and it was Gore who was uninformed and didn't even know the administration policy,'' Thiessen said. Gore on Friday welcomed Yugoslavia's change, saying it brings the country ``back into the community of nations.'' He added, ``This is a day for celebration,'' without commenting on the Russian issue. The White House, however, came to his defense. ``What the vice president said is something the president fully agrees with, which is that the United States did not support any role in which Russia would mediate between Milosevic and Kostunica,'' said presidential spokesman Jake Siewert, who confirmed that Clinton spoke with Putin about Yugoslavia last weekend. The dispute over a foreign policy matter comes late in a campaign that has given little attention to most offshore issues. What discussion there has been has tended to involve a contrast in plans for the military. Bush decries the state of the military and calls for more-limited engagement abroad. Gore defends current military readiness and urges a definition of national security interests that would include environmental, health and other global issues. The candidates also have differences on missile defense, nuclear arms cuts, global warming, immigration and trade, but none of those issues has turned into a major debate. Gore has been active in foreign affairs as vice president, serving on commissions with key countries, including one with former Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin. Bush's supporters say that despite his lack of direct foreign policy experience, his record as Texas governor, including dealings with neighbor Mexico, show he'll inspire the trust of allies and the respect of adversaries. Cheney, defense secretary for four years under President Bush, has lent a measure of experience to candidate Bush's claims that the Clinton administration has shortchanged the military and GOP plans to limit foreign deployments. Democrat Joseph Lieberman matches some of Cheney's foreign policy experience with his Senate Armed Services Committee membership and involvement on a range of international issues during his dozen years in the Senate.

Ivory Coast's main opposition leader urged his supporters to stay calm Saturday after the Supreme Court barred him from running in elections meant to restore civilian rule to the West African country. Twenty candidates submitted applications to participate in the Oct. 22 vote. But only five, including junta leader Gen. Robert Guei, were found eligible to run, according to a Supreme Court ruling read late Friday. The main opposition leader, Alassane Dramane Ouattara, was rejected along with ousted President Henri Konan Bedie and one of his former Cabinet ministers, Emile Constant Bombet. Some Ouattara supporters had warned of civil unrest if he was excluded. Junta officials had countered with threats of harsh reprisals for any violence. But in a telephone interview from his house in Abidjan, Ouattara said that he and his supporters would not initiate any violence, though clashes were still possible. ``If the country has to burn, it will be Gen. Guei who will be responsible for it,'' Ouattara said, calling the Oct. 22 vote a ``masquerade election.'' With a state of emergency in effect, the commercial capital remained calm Saturday morning. Many stores were closed and there were fewer people in the streets than usual, but buses were functioning normally and security forces kept a low profile. The Supreme Court said it had doubts about the nationality of Ouattara's mother, who was listed under different names in his supporting documents, and argued that the opposition leader had made use of a nationality other than Ivorian during his career. Ivory Coast's new constitution, approved by the junta, states that both parents of a presidential candidate must have been born in the country, and that they themselves must never have used any other nationality. The junta, which took power in a Dec. 24 coup, claims Ouattara's mother has her origins in neighboring Burkina Faso. Ouattara insists both his parents are Ivorian, and that he never legally assumed any other nationality. Reasons for ruling out the other candidates ranged from corruption allegations to irregularities in their applications and failure to make the necessary financial deposit. Laurent Gbagbo, a longtime politician who has lost several previous election bids, was the only well known figure permitted to stand against Guei. After seizing power in the coup _ Ivory Coast's first _ Guei initially promised a quick handover to civilian rule. But he has since traded his military uniform for a suit and tie and has rallied several small political parties around his candidacy despite international calls to step down. The Ivory coast has sub-Saharan Africa's third-largest economy, dependent on exports of coffee and cocoa

With the army behind him and Slobodan Milosevic wishing him well, Vojislav Kostunica was poised to take his presidential oath and begin leading Yugoslavia out of a decade of war and turmoil and into a welcoming Europe. The inaugural ceremony was scheduled to begin Saturday afternoon in Belgrade's city hall, across the street from the gutted and ransacked federal parliament building, the scene of Milosevic's last stand. A day after angry protesters battled their way into parliament and ousted his regime, Milosevic addressed the Yugoslav people in a televised speech late Friday, conceding he had lost Sept. 24 presidential elections. ``I congratulate Mr. Kostunica on his electoral victory and I wish much success to all citizens of Yugoslavia,'' Milosevic said. The speech signaled the Yugoslav president has abandoned hopes of preventing Kostunica from being sworn into office. Hours after Milosevic's address, the army's chief of staff, Nebojsa Pavkovic, also congratulated Kostunica, and indicated the military would obey the new political authority. Yugoslavia's high court had also named Kostunica the election winner and powerful Yugoslav ally Russia offered its support earlier in the day. In his speech, Milosevic said he wanted to take a break, before restarting an active political life. As an indicted war criminal, he has little chance of seeking asylum abroad and has no choice but to try to reach an accommodation with the new government. ``I intend to rest a bit and spend some more time with my family and especially with my grandson, Marko, and after that to help my party gain force and contribute to future prosperity,'' he said. But the strongman's son, Marko Milosevic, his wife Zorica and son Marko Jr., on Saturday boarded a Yugoslav Airlines flight to Moscow, the independent Beta news agency reported. Milosevic's son is believed to have an extensive business empire stretching out of the Milosevic family hometown of Pozarevac. The concession by Milosevic prompted bursts of gunfire and wild honking of car horns in the streets of Belgrade, where tens of thousands kept up celebrations that began Thursday in the wake of a tumultuous uprising against 13 year's of Milosevic's autocratic rule. Greek Foreign Minister George Papandreou arrived in Belgrade on Saturday, the Greek Embassy said. Igor Ivanov, Russia's foreign minister, held talks with both Kostunica and Milosevic on Friday. Norway's foreign minister, Thorbjoern Jagland, was due to follow in his Greek counterpart's footsteps and arrive here later Saturday, in a further show of support for Kostunica. Further confirming Kostunica's position, the speaker of the Serbian parliament, Dragan Tomic, addressed Kostunica as president in a letter Friday _ the first such recognition by a high official from Milosevic's Socialist Party of Serbia. But some anti-Milosevic leaders, like Zoran Djindjic, reacted to the president's remarks with caution. ``I don't trust him,'' Djindjic said. ``I think he is preparing positions for a stab in the back by consolidating police, creating chaos and returning to power with a strong hand.'' Milosevic is blamed by the West for starting _ and then losing _ four Balkan wars which broke out in the last decade when parts of Yugoslavia began to seek independence. Those conflicts were marked by horrific acts of violence against civilians, which prompted Western governments to impose sanctions and isolate Belgrade. Some of those controls were eased after Milosevic signed the 1995 agreement to end the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina. However, other sanctions were imposed again in 1998 after Milosevic launched a brutal crackdown on ethnic Albanians in Kosovo. Pavkovic, a former Milosevic crony, expressed confidence that Kostunica will help ``overcome all the remaining problems in a civilized way and return the country to normalcy,'' Tanjug news agency reported. He also pledged that the army will carry its duties according to the constitution. In recent days, both the United States and the European Union have said they will begin to lift sanctions as the new democratic administration takes the reins. ``This is great news,'' Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said about Kostunica's apparent victory, calling it ``very, very important.'' French President Jacques Chirac invited Kostunica to join leaders from the 15 EU nations at a summit in the French coastal city of Biarritz on Oct. 13-14. It could offer Kostunica a prime opportunity to seek foreign investment and other aid. But returning Yugoslavia to normal footing may pose its own dilemmas. The sanctions and years of Balkan warfare has left the economy in ruins. Last year's 78-day NATO bombardment hammered an already creaky transportation and utility network. Kostunica was putting together a stopgap crisis committee to try to stabilize the country. Somehow he will also have to work with close Milosevic allies, such as powerful Serbian President Milan Milutinovic. Like Milosevic, Milutinovic was indicted by the international war crimes tribunal for the offensive against ethnic Albanians in Kosovo. Kostunica could come under strong Western pressure to turn over indicted war criminals. In Greece, Milosevic's friend and alleged business associate Vladimir Bokan was shot dead early Saturday outside his luxury home in Voula, an Athens seaside suburb, police said. Bokan, 40, who had been under police investigation for money laundering and smuggling gasoline and arms, was shot several times while getting out of his car by gunmen carrying a handgun and an assault rifle. It was not immediately clear who the killers were or if the murder was linked to events in Yugoslavia.

The black plumes of smoke rising from Yugoslavia's federal Parliament building as a flag-waving throng storms the building will forever define the Serbian revolution that toppled Slobodan Milosevic. In its way, the image has the force of the photograph of a soldier planting the Soviet flag atop the Reichstag in Berlin in 1945. Both images are overwhelming in their glorious finality. But Yevgeny Khaldei's Reichstag photograph was a perfect representation of victory in a bloody war, whereas the iconic images of the end of Milosevic's 13-year rule seem to offer a partial truth. Without the critical injection of force at a pivotal moment _ the hard men from central Serbia storming past the hesitant police and their tear gas _ the opposition's protests might have proved as ineffectual as they so often had in the past. But Milosevic was downed less by violent upheaval than by the broad, massive, nonviolent protest that has characterized the fall of so many authoritarian regimes in recent years. What goes around comes around. It was always clear that the cycle of war that went out from Belgrade in the early 1990s would one day end where it began. Milosevic and Balkan stability were always incompatible. But what few predicted was that Serbia might join the Philippines, Chile and the post-communist states of central Europe in outlining a modern paradigm: revolution through bloodless consensus. In this light, Serbia's revolution was perhaps best captured by the failed attempt of the army and its chief, Nebojsa Pavkovic, to break a crippling strike at the Kolubara coal mine this week. Here, a day before the storming of the Parliament, it became clear that the police were unwilling to use force to break up a protest movement that had spread to workers. So by the time that movement entered the Parliament, it was in effect pitted against an enemy that had already indicated a willingness to surrender. As in so many recent popular revolts, the falling ruler's fate was sealed as he lost the instruments of power one by one. Milosevic was stripped first of the television stations he had used so skillfully to stoke Serb nationalism and a brooding sense of victimization; then of the courts he had manipulated, which on Wednesday nullified the election but on Friday pronounced his rival the winner; and finally, of the police and the army. ``Nonviolent resistance is not a magic wand, it's a strategy,'' said Jack DuVall, the co-author of ``A Force More Powerful: A Century of Nonviolent Conflict'' (St. Martins Press), a new book on peaceful protest. ``The essential thing, as Gandhi saw, is to detach a regime from its means of support. The Serbian opposition understood this, and the critical detachment occurred in the last two weeks.'' It is not over yet, of course. Serbia's soft revolution is still a muddle. The style of Vojislav Kostunica, the president-elect and a constitutional lawyer who became a revolutionary despite himself, is slow-moving, an advantage in coalition-building but not necessarily in revolution-handling in a state whose borders remain unclear. He is at the apex of a federation whose very existence is in question. He will have to confront the push for independence from Kosovo, still nominally a Serbian province, and a tense standoff with Montenegro, the other republic of the Yugoslav federation. Serbia has yet to face the delicate and charged question of how, or whether, it will confront the brutalities of the Milosevic years. Kostunica is a democrat, but he is also a Serbian nationalist, though not of the virulent strain Milosevic fostered and exploited. He has shown no inclination to bow to U.S. pressure to deliver Milosevic to the international war crimes tribunal in The Hague, and he has said the question of war crimes by Serbs should be addressed alongside the question of whether NATO too committed them when it bombed Serbia. Events could spill in all kinds of directions, including one that might leave Milosevic and his influential wife, Mira Markovic, no better off than Nicolae Ceausescu and his wife, Elena, who were executed by their fellow Romanians in 1989. If Kostunica has continuously urged restraint, it is because he understands that aggression would merely have played into the hands of a regime that always practiced the politics of violence. Why play on your enemy's terms? That calculation was clear enough. But what combination of the international zeitgeist and the state of Serbia led Milosevic to quit (to spend more time with his grandson, he said!) rather than order his forces to open fire and suppress Kostunica's revolt? After all, he had little hesitation in suppressing Albanian strikers in Kosovo in the late '80s or students in Belgrade in '91. One factor is clearly that the post-Cold War rise of the politics of ethics and human rights, after the discrediting of totalitarianism and communist systems, have limited a strongman's margin for maneuver, especially as any crackdown is instantaneously beamed to a worldwide audience. Global politics and technology are inimical to the use of brutality in ways that are increasingly persuasive and that did not exist in Prague in 1968. ``The general trend is such that any army commander in a place like Serbia is going to ask: Even if we can resist this for one week, scatter the protesters for a few days, what then?'' said Jonathan Eyal, a British strategic analyst. ``In 1945, communism was a thing of the future. Today you have to ask the point of executing an order to fire.'' Especially for a man as isolated as Milosevic. A ruined economy, a lost war in Kosovo, an indictment from the tribunal in The Hague, all led to his progressive alienation from his people and the countries around him. ``Come home to Europe,'' Tony Blair, the British prime minister, exhorted the Serbian people as Milosevic tottered. Europe, here, was shorthand for human dignity, democracy and the rule of law. Such ideas have proved increasingly compelling. Certainly, from the fall of Ferdinand Marcos in the Philippines in 1986, to the rejection in a plebiscite of the Pinochet regime in Chile in 1987, to Romania in 1989, to the failed Soviet putsch in Moscow in 1991, to Serbia today, a pattern seems clear enough. Once a catalyst has sparked nonviolent protest on a broad scale, the army is not ready to fire _ or go on firing for long enough _ on its own people. The exception to this pattern, of course, was at Tiananmen Square, where Chinese authorities quashed the student revolt. No stronger image of passive resistance could be found, or imagined, than the solitary student who stood before a Chinese tank. Yet it proved ineffective. ``The mistake in China was the students' decision to maximize demands before trying to broaden their movement,'' Duvall argued. ``The success of nonviolent protest ultimately hinges on having a broad base.'' As Serbs set fire to the federal Parliament building, Gerhard Schroeder, Germany's leader, sent a message to the Yugoslav army and the Serbian police force: ``My appeal _ and I say this as German chancellor on the basis of our experience during the time of the Berlin Wall _ is don't fire on your own people. That would be a tragedy.'' In fact, it was the fall of the Wall that removed the last bastion _ in Moscow _ that might have given some cover for an act of violent repression by Milosevic. That is why he persisted for so long in saying that the fall of the Soviet Union was not irreversible. As Milosevic kept rowing against the tide of history, he increasingly developed a sort of soft dictatorship _ a ``dictablanda'' rather than a ``dictadura.'' This combined elements of a dictatorship _ a powerful secret police, effective control of the media, fear-mongering propaganda, a secretive style of government _ with acts like holding the very presidential election that ultimately led to his fall. His error, in the end, was to believe he could control the vote through the authoritarian methods at his disposal. Once that failed, he was no longer enough of a dictator to hold power by other means.

Vojislav Kostunica, whose shoe-leather campaign and dour honesty made him the choice of a nation fed up with Slobodan Milosevic, stood before Yugoslavs on Saturday as their new leader. Kostunica, a 56-year-old constitutional lawyer, won presidential elections Sept. 24 but has been put in office by a popular revolution. The scene on Saturday at the Sava Center _ a replacement for the federal Parliament building, burned last week in the revolt that made Milosevic concede the presidency _ was chaotic. Newly elected legislators who had gathered for the inauguration of Kostunica and their own swearing-in negotiated furiously about a future federal government. Supported by a loose coalition of 18 disparate and notoriously quarrelsome opposition parties, Kostunica now faces the daunting task of constructing a new government and institutionalizing the revolution while keeping to the legal order he cherishes. One of his first problems will be to guide an opposition that has never run anything larger than a city. But he must also work to maintain the very Yugoslav Federation over which he presides. He must deal with the problem of a restive Montenegro that has moved a long way toward independence and of a Kosovo that is run by the United Nations and whose largely Albanian population wants only independence. Kostunica says he will try to establish a unity government of experts on the federal level that could include members of other parties that had backed Milosevic, like the Montenegrin Socialist People's Party and even Milosevic's party itself. Talks on Saturday with the Montenegrin president, Milo Djukanovic, who boycotted the September elections and thus has no supporters in the federal Parliament, make Kostunica hopeful that he can support such a government. But it seemed that the Montenegrin Socialists would remain in coalition with the parties of Milosevic and his wife, which would give them a majority in Parliament. Compared with his internal problems, working out new relationships with the rest of Europe and the United States _ which have welcomed Milosevic's downfall with full-throated delight _ could be easy, despite questions over the extradition of Milosevic and other Serbs to The Hague, Netherlands, on war-crimes charges. The West is eager to help Serbia with financial and other aid and has promised to begin lifting some international sanctions against Yugoslavia _ though not the most damaging ones _ as early as Monday. As the federal legislators gathered here Saturday morning, there were reports by witnesses that Milosevic's son, Marko Milosevic, had flown on a Yugoslav Airlines flight to Moscow, YU-132, with his wife, Milica, and his son, Marko. Ida Kovacevic, a flight attendant on the plane, said in an interview after the flight returned here: ``Marko came in as an ordinary passenger. He acted normally, and we acted normally. There was no special treatment.'' She confirmed that his wife and son were also aboard. Belgraders noted gleefully on Saturday that in his resignation speech Friday night, Milosevic said he wanted ``to spend more time with my family, especially my grandson, Marko.'' ``He should go join them soon,'' said Vesna Mitic, standing on Saturday staring at the burned-out Parliament building where the new legislature can no longer meet. But Meri Locani said: ``I wouldn't even let him go to Russia. Why did he let all this happen? If people have a chance, they would hang him and his wife here in the square.'' When she heard Milosevic's resignation speech, Locani said, ``I was so happy, as happy as I've ever been.'' She wiped her eyes. She has a paraplegic daughter, Savina, 27, she said. ``I'd be the happiest person in the world if she could walk. But in the last few days I was so happy. It was almost as if she were walking.'' But Milosevic remains in Serbia with stated ambitions to continue in politics as the leader of his Socialist Party, which makes many uneasy. Aleksandar Tijanic, Milosevic's former spokesman who became a critic of the rule, said Saturday, ``As long as Milosevic remains on the Serbian political scene and shows a desire to be politically active, he represents a threat.'' Milosevic ``represents the political interests'' of all those not in the democratic opposition, Tijanic said in an interview. But more important, ``he's also the supreme commander of the net of paramilitaries, parapolice and parafinancial interests'' that have thrived with and supported him and his wife, Mirjana Markovic. ``Milosevic can pull some strings,'' Tijanic said. ``These cannot bring down the new government, but can keep it in constant instability and keep the public of Serbia in a constant state of tension.'' One of Kostunica's main challenges, Tijanic said, is to enforce his authority over the opposition coalition, some of whose leaders want a revolutionary bypassing of the law. ``He should break down party interests in the coalition, because he won as the candidate of Serbian political opinion, and not as their candidate,'' he said. The more powerful Yugoslavian Parliament, which has supported Milosevic and whose members are not scheduled to face election until next year, is to meet on Monday. Maneuvering there with two parties that have been sometime allies of Milosevic could alter the face of the Yugoslavian government, but exactly who will now control that legislature remains uncertain. On Monday, the Yugoslavian Parliament will recognize Kostunica and may vote to fire the Yugoslavian interior minister, Vlajko Stojiljkovic, a Milosevic ally. The Parliament may also abolish the draconian information law passed in October 1998. But Kostunica and his allies must also begin to control the Yugoslavian ministries that are now beholden to Milosevic and his coalition. The opposition is moving ``minister by minister, institution by institution,'' trying to establish cooperation, a party leader said. New details emerged Saturday of Milosevic's meeting on Friday with Kostunica, after Foreign Minister Igor S. Ivanov of Russia met the two men and Milosevic decided to concede defeat in the elections. On Friday evening, Kostunica received the Yugoslav military chief of staff, Gen. Nebojsa Pavkovic, at presidential offices in the Palace of Federations in New Belgrade. Pavkovic promised him that the army would not intervene and congratulated him on his election victory, which makes Kostunica chairman of the country's Supreme Defense Council. Pavkovic then offered to show Kostunica the military command post, in a suburban Belgrade bunker, said Stevan Niksic, the editor of the weekly NIN. Once there, the general asked if Kostunica would like to meet Milosevic. The two men talked alone for an hour, Kostunica said on television on Friday night. The Greek and Norwegian foreign ministers flew to Belgrade on Saturday for the hastily arranged inauguration ceremony. The Greek minister, George Papandreou, and his government have tried to be intermediaries between Yugoslavia and Europe, and between Kostunica and the Milosevic government. Papandreou said the end of Milosevic's rule ushers in ``a new era in relations between Yugoslavia and Europe.''

Briskly adapting to the fall of Slobodan Milosevic, who was a close diplomatic ally, President Jiang Zemin Saturday sent ``heartfelt congratulations'' to the newly elected president of Yugoslavia. In his message to Vojislav Kostunica, whose election was certified this week only after a popular uprising forced Milosevic to relinquish power, Jiang wished the new president ``a smooth job in his new lofty position and remarkable achievements in his endeavors towards the stability and prosperity of Yugoslavia,'' according to a report by the New China News Agency. China was one of Milosevic's staunchest supporters during last year's NATO campaign against Yugoslavia over Kosovo, where Milosevic's security forces were killing and repressing the majority Albanian population. China's vehement opposition to the NATO military action _ portrayed here as an imperialistic expansion of American ``hegemony'' using human rights as a pretext _ arose in part from China's own fear that foreign powers might some day support ethnic insurrections in Tibet or in the Muslim region of Xinjiang. Throughout the Kosovo bombing campaign, China's official media virtually ignored reports of ``ethnic cleansing'' and other Serbian atrocities in Kosovo and described Milosevic and his government as heroic defenders of the sacred principle of national sovereignty. In June 1999, when the International Criminal Tribunal in the Hague indicted Milosevic for war crimes for promoting ethnic cleansing, the Chinese government described the indictment as an American-led ``political scheme.'' In June this year, China's parliament leader, Li Peng, visited Belgrade for three days, where Milosevic presented him with Yugoslavia's highest medal, the Great Star. But in the aftermath of the Kosovo war, Milosevic's international indictment and the rise of his domestic opponents, Li and other Chinese officials have generally stressed the common interests linking China and Yugoslavia rather than singling out Milosevic for praise. Saturday, a foreign ministry spokesman, Sun Yuxi, said that ``China respects the choice of the Yugoslavian people,'' adding that ``we believe that the change of situation in Yugoslavia will not affect the healthy development of China-Yugoslavia relations.'' The political turn in Belgrade has caused lively traffic on China's Internet bulletin boards, which last year were filled with anti-American venom. This time, many anonymous writers have made pointed comments about the success of democracy in Yugoslavia, with one saying, for example, ``Yugoslavs win democracy, how about us?'' and another saying, ``Milosevic's fall is making some people here nervous.''

Ivory Coast's main opposition leader promised Saturday to continue a peaceful fight for democracy, remaining defiant despite a court decision that barred him from running against the country's junta leader in upcoming presidential elections. In a veiled threat to the West African nation's military junta, opposition leader Alassane Dramane Ouattara said the regime is incapable of ``subverting the will of the people'' despite Friday's Supreme Court ruling. Twenty candidates had submitted applications to participate in the Oct. 22 election, called to restore civilian rule. But only five, including junta leader Gen. Robert Guei, were found eligible to run, according to the court decision read late Friday. Ouattara was rejected along with former president Henri Konan Bedie, the leader ousted by the military junta last winter. Some Ouattara supporters had warned of civil unrest if he was excluded. Junta officials had countered with threats of harsh reprisals for any violence. On Saturday, Ouattara accused Guei of ``buying'' the decision from court chief Kone Tia, the junta leader's former attorney. He called Tia ``one of the most corrupt judges in Ivory Coast.'' Ouattara urged his supporters to remain calm, instructing them in a statement to ``preserve our dear Ivory Coast from violence and to assure that the peace to which we are all attached is not threatened.'' But he warned that public anger over the decision could still explode. ``We know from Serbia what happens when the will of the people is being ignored,'' he said, referring to the opposition uprising in Yugoslavia that toppled President Slobodan Milosevic. ``One cannot predict what will happen in Ivory Coast.'' There were no immediate signs of unrest in Ivory Coast, where a state of emergency and nighttime curfew have been in effect since Friday. In Abidjan, the country's commercial capital, many stores were closed and there were fewer people in the streets than usual. But buses were running normally and security forces kept a low profile. In the streets surrounding Ouattara's hulking Abidjan mansion, where hundreds of supporters have camped out for weeks, young men wearing bandannas and white T-shirts reinforced sandbag barriers while chanting ``Ado,'' a popular nickname for Ouattara. ``If Ado tells us to die, we will die. We are just waiting for orders of what to do next,'' said one of the protesters, 24-year-old Mamadou Fofana. In its ruling, the Supreme Court said it had doubts about the nationality of Ouattara's mother and argued that the opposition leader had repeatedly used the nationality of neighboring Burkina Faso. Ivory Coast's new constitution requires that both parents of a presidential candidate be Ivorian-born and bars candidates that have used another nationality. Ouattara insists he meets those qualifications. With the exclusion of Ouattara and other major figures, Guei faces only one well-known politician, Laurent Gbagbo, a longtime opposition leader who has lost several previous election bids. ``Guei has assembled a team to run with him instead of against him,'' said Ouattara, saying none of the other contenders are threats to the military leader. After seizing power in the coup _ Ivory Coast's first _ Guei initially promised a quick handover to civilians. But he has since traded his military uniform for a suit and tie and has rallied several small political parties around his candidacy despite international calls to step down. The December coup shook Ivory Coast's standing as a stable financial and political power. The country has sub-Saharan Africa's third-largest economy, dependent on exports of coffee and cocoa.

Slobodan Milosevic's plans to remain active in politics could spell trouble for Yugoslavia's newly elected president and the victorious pro-democracy coalition. The disgraced autocrat's Socialist Party and its neo-communist allies appeared to be on the verge of collapse after massive and violent protests led them to acknowledge victory by opposition challenger Vojislav Kostunica in last month's presidential vote. Party activities have been suspended since Thursday, when pro-democracy demonstrators stormed federal parliament, the state television building and other centers of Milosevic's power. Milosevic, who has been indicted by the international war crimes tribunal in The Hague, Netherlands, cannot leave Yugoslavia without risking arrest and extradition. Kostunica has pledged not to extradite him. But Milosevic appears to retain enough residual power to block Kostunica's reforms and _ through proxies who still control Serbia's police _ Yugoslavia's reintegration into the world. ``I think he is preparing positions for a stab in the back by consolidating the police (and) creating chaos,'' Zoran Djindjic, head of the Democratic Party, told The Associated Press. After initial speculation that he was hiding out, a visibly shaken Milosevic appeared on TV late Friday to concede defeat and congratulate Kostunica on his victory. ``I intend to rest a little and spend some more time with my family and especially with my grandson, Marko, and after that to help my party gain force and contribute to future prosperity,'' he said. Other deposed leaders have managed to stay home and stay alive. But in countries like Chile and Indonesia, the old autocrats have been troublesome to new democratic regimes, sabotaging their efforts to overcome the legacy of authoritarian rule. Despite massive defeats in the presidential ballot and local council elections, the Socialists still have a majority in the state legislature of Serbia, Yugoslavia's dominant republic, where they are allied with the ultranationalist Radical Party. The president of Serbia, Milan Milutinovic, is one of Milosevic's closest cronies. He is also an indicted war criminal, and his fate depends on Milosevic's own political survival. The Serbian presidency has sweeping powers, including direct control over the state's 100,000-strong police force. Its powers are much more substantial than those of the federal president, even though Milosevic beefed up the post's stature under his tenure. ``Milutinovic occupies a very strong post and he will remain unswervingly loyal to Milosevic,'' said Braca Grubacic, a Belgrade political analyst. ``This presents Milosevic with unlimited possibilities to block any reforms initiated by Kostunica.'' Even on the federal level, Milosevic retains significant clout. His leftist coalition controls 46 of 178 seats in the federal parliament. Together with an allied party from Montenegro, Yugoslavia's smaller republic, his allies could conceivably form the new federal government, sidelining Kostunica. Ultimately, however, Milosevic's ability to play any political role will depend on his ability to rally his badly shaken party. Stunned by the extent of their electoral defeat, members were reported to be deserting in droves. Some opposition leaders are convinced Milosevic's power will ebb quickly, now that he has lost control of the government media he used as his propaganda mouthpiece during 13 years of iron-fisted rule. Milosevic also remains vulnerable to criminal prosecution for running one of Europe's most corrupt regimes. Some have accused him of orchestrating a spate of assassinations in which some of the country's most senior politicians and underworld figures have died. ``In the end, Milosevic may even prefer extradition to The Hague rather than stay here and face our justice,'' said opposition leader Zarko Korac.

now to yugoslavia, where a people's revolt overhe past few days has led to a dramatic change. a new president was officially sworn in today, bringing an end to the reign of slobodan milosevic. nbc's jim maceda reports from belgrade. in a simple ceremony before the newly elected parliament, vojislav kostunica took his oath of office late tonight as president of yugoslavia, marking the end of 13 years of autocratic rule under slobodan milosevic. it was a scene few serbs would have deemed possible only weeks ago. but it almost didn't happen, delayed by milosevic's party, which still controls the parliament. after meetings earlier today with a series of foreign dignitaries, kostunica admitted that milosevic may be down, but not out. "difficult times are behind us," he said. "but the days ahead also hold many trials." his main priority -- bringing serbia back into the international community after a decade of economic sanctions. many believe he has the credentials. a man who believes in democracy but who holds strong serb views. seen here armed with a machine gun, supporting the serb cause in kosovo. in a recent interview with nbc news, highly critical of u.s. policy in the balkans, especially the indictment of milosevic for war crimes. in some sense, it is sort of interfering in the affairs of another state. kostunica had already publicly said he would never turn milosevic over to the hague tribunal. then, yesterday, just before milosevic publicly conceded defeat, a one-hour meeting with kostunica -- their first ever -- said to be cordial. details have yet to be revealed, but at the very least, sources say, there was an exchange of guarantees for kostunica, a peaceful hand-over of power. and in return, safety and comfort inside serbia for milosevic. milosevic even intends to continue his political career, as leader of his party, worrying many who opposed him. as long as he's on the soil of this state, no one will be able to sleep quietly. tonight, despite poor weather, thousands of serbs celebrated a new era of freedom, with the fate of their former dictator still in doubt. jim maceda, nbc news, belgrade.

Calling his rise to power ``a dream,'' Vojislav Kostunica took the oath of office Saturday as Yugoslavia's first popularly elected president in a low-key ceremony that closed the traumatic era of Slobodan Milosevic _ a era that left the country isolated and destitute. But right away there were signs that Kostunica could face political fights from those remaining loyal to Milosevic, an indicted war criminal: The ceremony was delayed for hours by parliament wrangling over the results of disputed elections that set the stage for the popular uprising that carried Kostunica to power. The 56-year-old law professor was sworn in the modernistic Sava Center conference hall instead of the parliament building, which was burned and looted by mobs that raged against Milosevic's regime Thursday and forced him to finally accept election defeat the next day. Kostunica received a standing ovation from lawmakers after reading the oath. ``I promise that I will fulfill the constitution of Yugoslavia,'' a clearly moved Kostunica told federal parliament and invited dignitaries. ``I will perform my duties according to my conscience.'' With the army behind him and Milosevic grudgingly wishing him well after three tumultuous days of protests and rioting, the swearing-in finally put the stamp of legitimacy on Kostunica's leadership. The way seemed open for him to begin leading Yugoslavia away from isolation and sanctions. ``I think it is really a historic moment,'' he said in an address met with repeated applause. Kostunica urged parliament deputies to put aside the bitter confrontations of the past decade that led to bloodshed and anarchy. The future of Yugoslav democracy and prosperity depended on it, he said. ``My deepest political belief is that without democracy, there is no prosperity,'' he said, urging ``people who think differently (to) find ways to live together in one society.'' Kostunica said his swearing-in was the start of his country's re-entry into ``the family of nations'' _ a reunion that Yugoslavs were entering ``with dignity.'' ``To me, all this that is happening looks like a dream,'' he said. ``A dream that becomes reality.'' Earlier, though, harsh comments from Milosevic allies during the parliament session showed that Kostunica could face political turmoil. Milosevic's Socialists and an allied party together form the second-strongest bloc in parliament. Conspicuously absent from parliament, where she holds a seat, was Mira Markovic, the wife of Milosevic. But Vlajko Stojiljkovic, Serbia's interior minister, struck a defiant tone before the start of the parliament meeting. He described the events that led to Milosevic's ouster _ protests that turned to the storming of federal parliament and other key buildings _ as ``the work of hooligans.'' Another key Milosevic supporter, Ljubisa Ristic, described the unrest as part of a ``coup'' against Milosevic. ``They're already creating a serious problem,'' said Milan Protic, Belgrade's mayor and a leading pro-democracy figure. ``We did not expect them to react like this.'' Milosevic has vowed to remain in Yugoslavia as a political force. Kostunica has said he would defy Western demands to surrender Milosevic and other indicted war criminals to the tribunal in The Hague. At the inaugural session of the new Yugoslav parliament were key Milosevic allies such as Serbian President Milan Milutinovic _ another official indicted by the war crimes tribunal. Serbia and smaller, Western-oriented Montenegro comprise Yugoslavia. Milutinovic has sweeping powers, including direct control over Serbia's 100,000-strong police force. The Serb president's powers are technically more substantial than those of the federal president, even though Milosevic beefed up the post's stature under his tenure. Perhaps mindful of the potential for trouble still ahead, Kostunica was low-key in comments about Milosevic and his future. ``For now, it is more than enough that Milosevic congratulated me,'' Kostunica said. ``Difficult times are behind us, but the days ahead also hold many trials.'' Milosevic addressed the Yugoslav people in a televised speech late Friday, conceding he had lost the presidential elections. Hours after Milosevic's address, the army's chief of staff, Gen. Nebojsa Pavkovic, congratulated Kostunica and indicated the military would obey the new political authority. Yugoslavia's high court had also named Kostunica the election winner, and powerful Yugoslav ally Russia offered its support. In his speech Friday, Milosevic said he wanted to take a break before restarting an active political life. As an indicted war criminal, he has little chance of seeking asylum abroad and has no choice but to try to reach an accommodation with the new government. His concession prompted bursts of gunfire and wild honking of car horns in the streets of Belgrade, where tens of thousands kept up celebrations that began Thursday in the wake of a tumultuous uprising against 13 years of Milosevic's autocratic rule. Milosevic is blamed by the West for starting _ and then losing _ four Balkan wars which broke out in the last decade when parts of Yugoslavia began to seek independence. Those conflicts were marked by horrific acts of violence against civilians, which prompted Western governments to impose sanctions and isolate Belgrade. Some of those controls were eased after Milosevic signed the 1995 agreement to end the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina. However, other sanctions were imposed again in 1998 after Milosevic launched a brutal crackdown on ethnic Albanians in Kosovo. In the past days, both the United States and the European Union have said they will begin to lift sanctions as the new democratic administration takes the reins.

With Vojislav Kostunica in office as president, backers of the pro-democracy leader embarked Sunday on the potentially volatile task of forming a government that tries to exclude backers of former leader Slobodan Milosevic. Kostunica's team was faced with a difficult task: Putting together a government with as few old faces as possible, while placating a Milosevic wing that still wields considerable power. ``We need a government of discontinuity,'' said opposition leader Zoran Djindjic, who helped manage Kostunica's rise to power _ from his election campaign through the brief revolt that forced Milosevic to concede defeat and Kostunica's swearing-in Saturday. Milosevic himself has said he will remain in Yugoslavia as a political force. Kostunica has said he will defy Western demands to surrender the outgoing president and others indicted by the U.N. war crimes tribunal in The Hague. And Serbia, the main Yugoslav republic, still is run by a government of Milosevic cronies including Serbian President Milan Milutinovic _ like Milosevic, indicted by the tribunal. Milutinovic controls approximately 100,000 policemen in his republic and, indirectly, much of the republic's economy. Kostunica's pro-democracy forces have said they would demand early elections for new Serbian parliament and president. Kostunica scored a stunning upset over Milosevic in the Sept. 24 presidential election. Milosevic's attempt to deny Kostunica's victory sparked a national uprising, and he conceded defeat Friday. Norway's Foreign Minister Thorbjoern Jagland and Mladjan Dinkic, the head of an influential group of economists, demanded Sunday that Milosevic be punished for vote-rigging. ``We now expect state prosecutors to bring charges against Slobodan Milosevic,'' Dinkic said. A human rights group in Yugoslavia, the Humanitarian Law Fund, also demanded punishment for the ousted autocrat, issuing long lists of his alleged misdeeds. Dinkic also called for a donor's conference on Yugoslavia with the aim of injecting at least $500 million into the cash-strapped country over the next year. Cleaning house at top levels is also seen as important for Yugoslavia in its efforts to break out of a decade of sanctions and international isolation meant to bring Milosevic to heel. Milosevic is blamed by the West for starting _ and then losing _ four Balkan wars that broke out in the last decade when parts of Yugoslavia began to seek independence. Those conflicts were marked by horrific acts of violence against civilians, which prompted Western governments to impose sanctions and isolate the government in Belgrade. A new government should ``be able to show up in Brussels and Washington and say: `the country has democratized ... we ask from you to lift the sanctions,''' Djindjic said. Both the United States and the European Union have said they will begin to lift sanctions once the new government is in place. French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine confirmed Sunday that the EU would partially lift sanctions on Monday. Djindjic spoke after the inaugural session of the Yugoslav Parliament, where Kostunica took office. Kostunica pledged to follow his conscience in leading Yugoslavia and urged lawmakers to bury past enmities that led to bloodshed and chaos. The 56-year-old legal scholar promised to return Yugoslavia to democracy and end the ethnic conflict and economic devastation that marked the 13 years of Milosevic's rule. ``Everything is peaceful,'' he said. ``Yugoslavia and Serbia have joined the family of democratic nations.'' Still, discord could resurface, at least in parliament. The swearing-in itself was repeatedly delayed by Milosevic allies who contested parts of the Sept. 24 vote. And with Kostunica's 18-party opposition block short of an absolute majority, it appears compelled to deal with the Socialist People's Party of Montenegro, the smaller Yugoslav republic. That party backed Milosevic until his downfall and now seeks to have one of its own appointed as Yugoslavia's prime minister _ the constitution says that if the president is from Serbia, the prime minister must be Montenegrin. With the opposition outnumbered in parliament, a nonpartisan government of experts, as favored by many in the Kostunica camp, has little chance of being formed.

Secretary of State Madeleine Albright on Sunday criticized Russia for moving slowly to recognize Vojislav Kostunica as president. Albright also hedged on whether the administration would continue to insist that Slobodan Milosevic be tried in The Hague as a war criminal. Kostunica, a legal scholar who questions the independence of the U.N. war crimes tribunal, has made it clear he will not arrest Milosevic or extradite him, saying that Milosevic's electoral concession should not be ``a matter of life or death.'' Albright said on NBC's ``Meet the Press' that there must be ``accountability'' and respect for ``the rule of law.'' She also stressed her support for the war crimes tribunal. But she declined to respond directly on whether she thought Milosevic should be extradited to The Hague. Milosevic and some top aides also have been charged with war crimes in conflicts in Croatia and Kosovo. They have not been arrested or brought to trial. Robin Cook, the British foreign secretary, said in London that decisions about Milosevic's future could wait until the government consolidated its power. But he said Kostunica's victory presented ``a better chance'' of bringing Milosevic to trial in The Hague. ``We can't continue to try the generals, the sergeants ... and not hold to account the man whose policies they were carrying out,'' Cook told Sky TV on Sunday. In Washington, a senior U.S. official said the first priority was that Kostunica's government settle in and take effective control of the reins of power. But as Yugoslavia draws closer to European nations, the new government will realize that until Milosevic faces the war crimes tribunal, Yugoslavia will not be reintegrated, said the official, speaking on condition of anonymity. Russia lagged behind the United States and the European allies in recognizing Kostunica's triumph in the Sept. 24 election. And Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov, who went to Belgrade to arrange a resignation deal in meeting with Kostunica and Milosevic, was said by Western sources to have carried assurances that if Milosevic surrendered power there would be no pressure for a war crimes trial. ``We did not want the Russians to mediate,'' Albright said, reflecting the U.S. position that no deal should be cut with Milosevic. ``They weren't the only ones there,'' she said, adding, ``They did not play the role they needed to at the right time.'' But ``in recognizing President Kostunica, they have done the right thing,'' Albright said. Meanwhile, Sandy Berger, President Clinton's national security adviser, said Milosevic was an indicted war criminal and ``deservedly so.'' ``And we believe he has to be accountable,'' Berger said on ABC's ``This Week.'' Berger was also critical of Russia's role in the turnover of power in Belgrade. He said the Russians threw their weight behind Kostunica ``at the 11th hour'' but ``wish it had been at the 10th hour.'' Russia's role was an issue in last week's presidential debate between Vice President Al Gore and Texas Gov. George W. Bush. Republican Bush suggested the Russians ``have a lot of sway'' in Yugoslavia and might be able to persuade Milosevic to leave office. Democrat Gore said he was troubled by Russia's unwillingness to recognize Kostunica's election victory and if President Vladimir Putin mediated, ``We might not like the result.''

A person deemed to have made the most significant discovery in medicine will become a Nobel laureate on Monday, kicking off a week of prize announcements culminating with the prestigious peace award. The prizes, each worth $915,000 this year, are always surrounded by speculation. The suspense for the literature award _ usually the first announced _ was heightened last week when the Swedish Academy failed to reach a decision, leaving the timing of that announcement uncertain and bumping medicine into the top slot. ``Sometimes they come to a decision very quickly,'' Svante Fregert, an editor at the daily newspaper Svenska Dagbladet said. ``But they probably have two or three names and if the vote is even, then they have to do it again.'' The winners of the prizes for physics and chemistry will be announced Tuesday and for economics _ the only one not established in Nobel's will _ on Wednesday in Stockholm. The peace prize is to be announced Friday in Oslo, Norway. Alfred Nobel, the Swedish industrialist and inventor of dynamite, left only vague guidelines in his will establishing the prizes. The selection committees deliberate in strict secrecy. The only public hints available are for the peace prize. The five-member awards committee never reveals the candidates, but sometimes those making the nominations announce their favorites. This year that includes President Clinton and former President Jimmy Carter for wide-ranging peace efforts, as well as former U.S. Sen. George Mitchell for his efforts to resolve conflict in Northern Ireland. Other reported nominees are former Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari and former Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin for their Balkan peace efforts; South Korean President Kim Dae-jung for promoting good relations in Asia; and a town, northern Albania's Kukes, for accepting 150,000 refugees during the Kosovo conflict. The academy traditionally keeps the date of the literature prize secret until a couple days before it announces the winner, but it is always a Thursday, usually in October. Last year, they caught prize-watchers off guard by announcing the literature winner on the last day in September. Paolo Mauri, culture editor of the Rome-based daily Repubblica, has suggested _ as many others have _ that Chinese writer Bei Dao or Belgian writer Ugo Claus would be named the winner. Other possibilities include usual suspect V.S. Naipaul, a Trinidad-born writer living in London, two of the world's great short story writers, Canada's Alice Munro and Ireland's William Trevor. Among other favorites mentioned in speculation are Salman Rushdie, Peruvian Mario Vargas Llosa; Israel's Amos Oz; Nigerians Chinua Achebe and Ben Okri; South Africa's J.M. Coetzee; Canadian novelist Margaret Atwood and Americans John Ashbery, Philip Roth, Joyce Carol Oates and Norman Mailer. The prizes bring heavy media attention, and the winners can expect their lives to change. ``It's a mixed blessing having the prize,'' says Swedish publisher Jonas Ellerstroem, who has had contact with many Nobel-winning writers. ``They will have to spend quite some time being this year's winner.'' The literature and peace laureates are usually the most visible, but the new adjective often also brings scientists more attention from outside their laboratories. As for the first announcement, Nobel's direction that a prize be awarded to the person who made ``the most important discovery within the domain of physiology or medicine'' is interpreted by a committee of 50 professors from the world-renowned Karolinska Institute in the Swedish capital. The Nobel Assembly at Karolinska invites nominations from previous recipients, professors of medicine and other professionals worldwide before whittling down its choices in the fall, as do the other selection committees. The awards always are presented Dec. 10, the anniversary of Nobel's death in 1896. ___ On the Net: http://www.nobel.se

now to the revolution in yugoslavia. the french foreign minister said today the european union will lift some economic sanctions against yugoslavia tomorrow now that slobodan milosevic is out of power. but his exit from office doesn't mean the former strong man will be standing trial for war crimes any time soon. here's abc's bob woodruff. today belgrade is quiet. the parliament building that was attacked and burned has become a tourist site, and life is returning to normal. but slobodan milosevic, the accused war criminal, is still here. the new president, vojislav kostunica, refuses to send him to the hague. although milosevic's son marko fled the country yesterday for russia, milosevic shows no sign of leaving. just three days ago as the mobs attacked anything associated with their leader, it looked like he was finished, that a war crimes trial was likely. but somehow he survived. in many ways, this national uprising was not as dramatic as it appeared. although milosevic himself was forced from power, the system that has protected him and the other accused war criminals remains in place. both the federal and the state parliaments here are still stacked with milosevic supporters. his friends control much of the economy. there's no question in government and outside of government milosevic's old cronies still have a certain grasp on power. but i don't think that power is going to last very long. even if the opposition weakens the milosevic machine, most ordinary serbs want to keep him in the country to try him for corruption and election fraud. to judge him here and after that to judge in hague and after that to kill him. war crimes are just not talked about much in serbia. the state-controlled media never reported on them. most serbs have never viewed the crime scenes in bosnia, croatia and kosovo. i think more than 90% of serbs don't even know that serbs committed any war crimes in these three wars that milosevic lost. so the pressure to extradite milosevic will have to come from the west and serbia, his circle remains strong enough to keep him here -- at least for now. bob woodruff, abc news, belgrade.

In what could represent a new way to save endangered species, scientists at a Massachusetts biotechnology company said Sunday that they had cloned an endangered Asian gaur and implanted the resulting embryo into a cow in Iowa. The guar, an oxlike creature that is native to India and Southeast Asia, is expected to be born next month. If the guar is born, it would represent the first cloning of an endangered species and the first cloned animal to use another species as a surrogate mother. Scientists say the technique could not only help preserve endangered species but also even revive species that are extinct. Indeed, the company, Advanced Cell Technology, of Worcester, Mass., said Sunday that it had received permission from the government of Spain to clone the already extinct bucardo mountain goat, using cells collected from the last goat before she died earlier this year. The company is also looking at cloning giant pandas using black bears as surrogate mothers and frozen cells from Hsing-Hsing and Ling-Ling, the famous pandas at the National Zoo that died in 1999 and 1992. But the technique, which seems right out of ``Jurassic Park,'' is raising ethical questions. Some conservationists fear that cloning would detract from other, less costly efforts at preserving habitat. And some say it is still not known if an animal raised by a mother of a different species will be able to thrive in the wild. ``It's more like an amusement park version of the species rather than the wild species,'' said Kent Redford, director of biodiversity analysis and coordination at the Wildlife Conservation Society in New York. ``We want to preserve a whole lot more than the genetic material,'' he said, adding that species should be preserved in their natural environments. ``That can't be reproduced in some Frankenstein lab.'' Robert P. Lanza, vice president for medical and scientific development at Advanced Cell Technology, said cloning would help reverse damage to wildlife habitat done by people. He called for zoos and wildlife officials to immediately begin collecting and freezing tissue samples of endangered species. ``For a few dollars of electricity you can preserve the genes of all the pandas in China,'' he said. He also said cloning was not likely to work on long-extinct species because it would be difficult or impossible to find intact DNA. ``You're certainly not going to be seeing dinosaurs in your back yard anytime soon,'' he said. To create the gaur, scientists took a skin cell from a recently deceased gaur and fused it with a cow's egg from which the chromosomes, containing the cow's genetic material, had been removed. The DNA of the gaur commandeered the egg, which grew into a gaur embryo. The embryo was implanted into the womb of a cow serving as a surrogate mother. The baby, which will be named Noah, should be an exact genetic copy of the gaur from which the skin cells were obtained. Previously, many scientists thought such cross-species cloning would be impossible because the DNA of the cloned animal would not be able to interact properly with the rest of the egg cell. The technique failed many more times than it was successful. The scientists created several hundred embryos but only 81 grew to the stage where they could be implanted. Some 42 were planted into 32 cows but only eight cows became pregnant. The fetuses were extracted from two cows for examination and five cows suffered spontaneous abortions, leaving only one cow that is still pregnant. Based on the examination of the fetuses, Lanza said, the gaurs seemed to be normal, not crosses between cows and gaurs. He said cows were used as egg donors and surrogate mothers because there are so few gaurs left that it would be unethical to round up wild female gaurs and subject them to the treatments needed to extract eggs and implant embryos. There have been cases of animals of one species being born in mothers of another species, including a house cat that gave birth to an African wildcat. But in these cases the implanted embryos were not the result of cloning. Advanced Cell Technology, which is trying to use cloning for medicine and agriculture, has set up a nonprofit foundation to carry on species preservation work, since it is not expected to turn into a big business. The work, assisted by various university scientists, is described in a paper in the current issue of the journal Cloning and in an article in the November issue of Scientific American. The cloning was reported in The Washington Post on Sunday.

Meet Bessie, who could soon be the first cow to give birth to a cloned ox. If she delivers the rare Asian gaur growing inside her, she will herald a stunning new way to save endangered, or even recently extinct, animals. The bovine surrogate mother is carrying the gaur fetus on a farm near Sioux City, Iowa, and is expected to give birth to ``Noah'' next month. ``He will be the first endangered animal we send up the ramp of the ark,'' said Robert Lanza, the vice president of medical and scientific development at Advanced Cell Technology, and one of the lead authors of a study published Sunday in the journal Cloning. ``This is no longer science fiction. It's very, very real.'' Scientists had previously shown it is possible for one species to give birth to implanted embryos taken from a similar species. But this is the first time they have combined that technique with cloning. Using a technique developed by ACT in Worcester, scientists removed the DNA from one of Bessie's eggs and fused the egg with a skin cell taken from a living gaur, producing a genetically gaur egg that would be accepted by Bessie's immune system. Noah doesn't have a father. Before being implanted in Bessie's uterus, the egg was artificially induced to begin dividing without being fertilized. The technique could not be used on long-extinct species because the DNA donor cells must come from a live animal, one that has been dead for less than five days, or one that has been frozen since its death. The goal of the research is to use the cross-species cell transfer technology to reprogram human cells for medical purposes, said Michael West, chief executive officer of ACT. Until then, if Noah's birth is successful, developers say the technique could be used to repopulate rare animal species. The Spanish government has given ACT approval to clone the bucardo, a newly extinct Spanish mountain goat. The last bucardo died earlier this year and was immediately frozen. Researchers also are considering rare animals such as the African bongo, the ocelot and the giant panda. ``We're not trying to build a big Noah's Ark and save every animal, but we want to point the way for how this can be done,'' he said. ``Saving the world is a tall order, but we're trying.'' However, animal preservationists fear the public will prefer the less-costly cloning techniques and pull funding for expensive breeding and habitat protection programs already in place. ``The danger is that this could be seen as an alternative,'' said John Rennie, editor of Scientific American magazine. ``But cloning is just one more tool to use along with the rest of the measures we already take to preserve species.'' Even some critics of cloning say the ACT researchers may have stumbled upon a positive use of the technology. ``There are no moral problems with this,'' said Michael Grodin, a professor in Boston University's School of Public Health who has opposed advances that could lead to the cloning of humans. ``There are a host of reasons why cloning humans is wrong, but this could be a positive step toward maintaining these species.'' Bessie was one of 32 cows implanted with the fused eggs, and the only one to bring an embryo to near-term. Three others came close, but researchers removed the embryos midway through the pregnancy to make sure the fetuses were developing. ``The tests showed that the chromosomes were developing as beautiful little gaurs,'' Lanza said. ``This is the very first time this technology has ever generated a full pregnancy.'' Although the technique could be used with cells from animals that were frozen immediately after death, it could not resurrect a woolly mammoth from specimens frozen for centuries in Siberian permafrost because their DNA has become fragmented, he said. ``It's like trying to rebuild the Roman Forum,'' Lanza said. ``All the pieces are somewhere in Rome, but you have to be able to reassemble them. And that would take a long time.'' ___ On the Net: Advanced Cell Technology: http://www.advancedcell.com/

Arab nations arranged medical aid Sunday for Palestinians injured in clashes in Jerusalem and the Palestinian areas, while around the Arab world thousands of demonstrators burned flags and called for their countries to break all relations with Israel. In Egypt, Jordan and elsewhere, students and other protesters marched in the streets, rallying against Israel's handling of clashes in Jerusalem, the West Bank and the Gaza Strip that have left more than 80 people dead, mostly Palestinians. More than a half-million people marched through the capital of Morocco, and in Yemen _ whose president has called for an Arab war against Israel _ tens of thousands descended on the U.N. office. Violence spread through the territories after hard-line Israeli opposition leader Ariel Sharon's Sept. 28 visit to a Jerusalem shrine holy to Muslims and Jews. Several Palestinians injured in the clashes thus far have been taken elsewhere in the Arab world for medical treatment. Egyptian celebrities, including movie star Youssra, visited some at Nasser hospital in Cairo. A Saudi plane landed Sunday at el-Arish airport near Egypt's border with the Gaza Strip to transfer eight casualties to Saudi Arabia for care. A flight from the United Arab Emirates also landed at el-Arish with medical supplies to be taken by land to Gaza, and Bahrain announced it, too, was sending a medical team and medical supplies for the Palestinian people. Meanwhile, the demonstrations continued. More than 2,000 students at al-Azhar University in Cairo and 7,000 at Cairo University demonstrated on their campuses, calling for an end to relations with Israel and urging Arab leaders to adopt a unified stand in support of the Palestinian people. Several anti-Israeli demonstrations were held Sunday in Yemen, where tens of thousands walked to the U.N. office in the capital of San`a, demanding the agency help end the killings. One police officer was injured outside the U.N. office when a protester's stone hit his forehead. The demonstrators then headed to the U.S. Embassy, shouting ``America wake up! There will be no America after today!'' Security was tighter than usual, but after a few minutes the crowd dispersed peacefully. About 150 Palestinians also demonstrated in San`a, carrying their national flags and pictures of Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, and Yemeni students in the capital burned Israeli flags. In Jordan, riot police confronted Jordan University students who tried to leave their campus to march to the Israeli Embassy. Reports of arrests varied, with Interior Ministry officials saying nobody had been arrested and students saying there had been 17 arrests. An Associated Press reporter saw three people being driven away by police. Apparently protesting against the violence, Jordan delayed the departure of its new ambassador to Israel. Government officials said Abdul-Illah al-Kurdi would remain in Jordan until ``conditions are ripe'' for him to assume duties at the Jordanian Embassy in Tel Aviv. In Morocco, some of the half-million people who demonstrated in the capital, Rabat, carried banners condemning ``Zionist aggression.'' Prime Minister Abderrahamane Youssoufi and a handful of ministers were at the head of the gigantic crush of marchers. In Iraq, meanwhile, the official Iraqi News Agency said top officials have decided to open military training camps for ``volunteers to liberate Palestine.'' A main street in Baghdad also was being renamed ``The Martyr Mohammed Aldura Street'' after a 12-year-old Palestinian boy killed by Israeli fire in the Gaza Strip, INA said. Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak has said Arafat must call a stop to the trouble by Monday evening or the Israeli-Palestinian peace process will be abandoned. Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, meanwhile, criticized Yemeni President Ali Abullah Saleh's recent call for war against Israel. ``We should try to find a way to salvage the deteriorating situation. War does not solve a problem,'' Mubarak said. Mubarak added that most Arab leaders have accepted invitations to a summit to be held Oct. 21 in Cairo to discuss the situation and Arab unity. In a telephone call on Sunday, Syrian President Bashar Assad urged President Clinton to persuade Israel to put an end to the mounting tensions, presidential spokesman Jubran Kourieh said. Russia, too, was trying to calm the tensions. Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov arrived Sunday night in Damascus, Syria and was expected to hold talks Monday morning with Assad. Russia's ITAR-Tass news agency said Ivanov also would visit Lebanon and Israel on Monday.

The United States and the European Union will start lifting economic sanctions against Yugoslavia today. Among the sanctions imposed against the regime of former President Slobodan Milosevic during the fight over Kosovo over an oil embargo and a ban on commercial air traffic. French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine said Sunday that relieving the pressure on Belgrade's devastated economy is the first step towards supporting the new President Vojislav Kostunica and reintegrating Yugoslavia into a democratic Europe.

A team of Russian divers has flown to Norway to prepare for recovery of bodies from the downed Kursk nuclear submarine. The fifteen divers left St. Petersburg Sunday for the Norwegian port of Bergen, the base for the special recovery mission. The operation set to begin October 18th is being led by Moscow and a Norwegian subsidiary of the US Oil Company, Haliberton. Russian authorities have yet to determine what caused the Kursk, one of the military's newest submarines to go down. The entire 118 men crew of the massive sub was killed when it plunged to the bottom of the Barents Sea last August.

Seeking to clear backers of Slobodan Milosevic from the political playing field, allies of President Vojislav Kostunica said they would ask for the dismissal of the government of Serbia, Yugoslavia's dominant republic. The plan was announced Sunday by Mladjan Dinkic, chief economic adviser to Kostunica, and tipped to become the head of the Yugoslav central bank. Dinkic said they would request the dismissal at a meeting Monday of Serbia's parliament, where Milosevic's Socialist party forms the majority. Although Kostunica was sworn in as Yugoslav president Sunday, several hurdles still stand in his way before he can push through democratic reforms after 13 years of autocratic rule by Milosevic. That rule ended after a popular uprising last week forced Milosevic to accept defeat in Sept. 24 presidential elections. Milosevic appointees remain under Kostunica in the federal government until he and his advisers can name a new prime minister and Cabinet acceptable to a majority in parliament. And on the Serbian government level, the leadership is also mostly pro-Milosevic. Kostunica's faction will ask Serbian President Milan Milutinovic to fire Serbian Prime Minister Mirko Marjanovic and his Cabinet, Dinkic said. Both Milutinovic and Marjanovic were among Milosevic's trusted cronies. Like Milosevic, Milutinovic was indicted last year by the U.N. war crimes tribunal in The Hague for atrocities committed by Yugoslav forces in Kosovo. ``They must be sacked right away, in order to prevent them from doing any more damage,'' Dinkic said Sunday on a TV phone-in program. Until new elections, Serbia should be run by a government of economic experts, he added. Serbia, one of two Yugoslav republics, makes up 90 percent of Yugoslavia's population of 10 million. Its pro-Milosevic president _ who by law has more powers than Kostunica _ controls about 100,000 police, and indirectly much of Serbia's economy. Serbia's president and parliament are elected separately from federal posts and were not involved in the contentious federal vote Sept. 24. Milutinovic and other Serbian government leaders were elected in 1998 to four-year terms. How to keep the state running on near empty was another problem facing Kostunica. Yugoslavia is bankrupt after a decade of stifling international anti-Milosevic sanctions and widespread corruption. Dinkic said a further blow to the country's economy was narrowly averted in the dying days of the Milosevic regime. Dinkic told a televised phone-in program that backers of the new president turned off the central bank's computer system to prevent raids on state coffers by Milosevic cronies. Dinkic also implicated Milosevic in unspecified economic wrongdoing. ``Milosevic has at most, a week to leave the country, or he will have to face court, and I don't mean the one in The Hague,'' said Dinkic, alluding to the U.N. war crimes court in the Netherlands that has indicted the former president. Of Milosevic's allies, Dinkic said: ``They tried to take away at least 50 million German marks ($22.5 million) electronically and in cash.'' Earlier, Norway's Foreign Minister Thorbjoern Jagland, and Dinkic, demanded that Milosevic be prosecuted for vote-rigging. ``We now expect state prosecutors to bring charges against Slobodan Milosevic,'' Dinkic said. A human rights group in Yugoslavia, the Humanitarian Law Fund, also demanded punishment for the ousted autocrat, issuing long lists of his alleged misdeeds. Yugoslavia suffered a decade of international sanctions under Milosevic meant to punish him for starting four Balkan wars that were accompanied by a string of atrocities. The sanctions _ and rampant corruption ascribed to Milosevic cronies _ have left the country bankrupt. Seeking to ease the suffering, the European Union said Sunday that it would start trying to lift those economic sanctions, including an oil embargo imposed during the Kosovo war in 1999. Dinkic also called for a donor's conference on Yugoslavia with the aim of injecting at least $500 million into the cash-strapped country over the next year.

Vuk Draskovic, once Yugoslavia's foremost opposition leader, was booed off a stage by angry spectators Monday when he tried to address a student rally. Draskovic, whose Serbian Renewal Movement refused to support Vojislav Kostunica in last month's presidential elections, returned to Belgrade over the weekend after spending a year in Montenegro under the protection of that Yugoslav republic's pro-Western government. ``Young people, I am back,'' Draskovic told the rally before the booing began. ``I came back to Serbia, scarred by the bullets of (Slobodan) Milosevic's regime.'' Instead of uniting with the rest of Serbia's opposition, Draskovic's party fielded its own candidate in the race for the Yugoslav presidency. He was accused of trying to split the opposition vote and thus weaken its chances of ending Milosevic's 13-year reign. Draskovic's candidate, Vojislav Mihajlovic, lost disastrously. He garnered only 3 percent of the votes, compared to Kostunica's 53 percent. The Serbian Renewal Movement also was crushed in the election for local councils, where the pro-democracy grouping won 80 percent of the votes. The defeat has led to calls from stunned party leaders for Draskovic to resign as party head. Draskovic led numerous violent protests against Milosevic's authoritarian rule in the early and mid-1990s. But after two assassination attempts in the past year _ which Draskovic said were organized by Milosevic _ he moved to the Montenegrin coastal resort of Budva. A year ago, a truck rammed Draskovic's car south of Belgrade. Draskovic was only slightly injured, but his brother-in-law and three bodyguards were killed. In June, gunmen opened fire at his home, grazing Draskovic and leaving him badly shaken.

A two-hour meeting here on Monday between the Egyptian president, Hosni Mubarak, and the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, ended with Mubarak's conspicuously avoiding any public appeal for Arafat to bow to the Israeli deadline Monday night night to end Palestinian violence. Later in the day, the deadline set by Prime Minister Ehud Barak passed without any public move by Arafat to meet the demand. Caught between American and Israeli demands that Egypt restrain the Palestinians and boiling anger across the Arab world at the heavy Palestinian casualties in 12 days of confrontation with Israeli troops and policemen in Gaza and the West Bank, Mubarak acted like a man walking a tightrope. Behind the scenes, he worked feverishly to promote diplomatic solutions. In public, he gave solid support to Arafat and the Palestinians, and blamed the Israelis for the violence. But in all his actions, Mubarak left no doubt that he, like President Clinton and indeed virtually all the leading figures in the current crisis, sees the clashes between the Israelis and the Palestinians as posing a grave threat of a wider conflagration, one that could erupt into a new Arab-Israeli war. He spent much of the day on the telephone with with other Arab leaders and Clinton, discussing possible diplomatic moves that could help head off a wider conflict. One such move, an urgent meeting in Cairo between Clinton, Mubarak and the two principal antagonists, Arafat and the Israeli prime minister, Ehud Barak, appeared to hang in the balance. Although Clinton appealed on Sunday to Mubarak to hold the meeting, possibly in Cairo, as early as the middle of the week, senior Egyptian officials said Monday night that no final decision on the meeting had been made. In Washington, a senior official said on Monday night that Clinton would decide in the next 24 hours about going ahead with the meeting. For the moment, Mubarak appeared to be investing much of his energy in arranging a meeting of Arab leaders that he had previously called for Oct. 21 and 22 in Cairo. This would be the first Arab summit meeting since 1996, and the first since the 1991 Persian Gulf war to be attended by Iraq, which since the war has been a pariah in most pan-Arab meetings. But even as Mubarak worked on diplomatic approaches, other Arab leaders, reflecting the angry passions that have erupted in the region, continued to issue statements on Monday that hinted at the possibility of war. Ominously, some of the harshest statements came from nations that have strong ties to the United States, and which had backed the American-led drive for peace. Saudi Arabia's crown prince, Abdullah bin Abdel Aziz, was quoted by the Saudi Press Agency as saying Barak should not assume that Saudi Arabia and other Arab nations would stand by if Israel attacked Lebanon or Syria. That possibility arises from a confrontation over three Israeli soldiers who were seized on Saturday by the Lebanon-based militant Islamic movement Hezbollah. ``Barak must think carefully before making the slightest intolerable step,'' Abdullah, chosen successor to King Fahd, was quoted as having said in Riyadh, the Saudi capital. Over the decades since Israel was founded, Arab nations, especially those that have avoided getting drawn directly into the four wars that have erupted since 1948, have often indulged in impassioned statements against Israel, then done little of practical significance. This time, too, there has been an amplitude of angry polemics, but no rush to get directly involved. Several Arab nations _ including Qatar, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia _ have pledged to fly emergency medical supplies to the Palestinians and to evacuate Palestinian wounded. But even this effort has foundered in the face of an Israeli decision on Sunday to close Gaza airport, in territory ceded politically to Arafat's Palestinian Authority but under tight Israeli security control, to the flights. Israeli officials cited security reasons, presumably concerns that the flights might be used for purposes other than ferrying medical supplies. Mubarak has steered a course that appears to have been deeply influenced by past Arab experience of confrontations with Israel, almost all of which have ended with the Arab nations worse off. In his public statements, he has sought to ride, and perhaps calm, the wave of Arab anger, by associating himself with the outrage against Israel's actions. But on the diplomatic front, he has set himself firmly against any widening of the conflict, certainly one that would involve Egyptian forces. After the meeting with Arafat on Monday, for example, Mubarak's spokesman summarized the discussion in a way that had the Egyptian leader laying all the blame for the violence on Israel, saying Mubarak had spoken of the need for ``intensive efforts'' to end Israeli attacks. There was no mention of Mubarak's having taken up Barak's request for Egyptian help in persuading Arafat to take actions that would ``restore complete calm in Israel and the West Bank as quickly as possible.'' Publicly, at least, Mubarak also sided with Lebanon in the dispute with Israel over the captured Israeli soldiers. In an official transcript made available Monday of remarks Mubarak made to reporters on Sunday during a visit to an Egyptian Army command center near Cairo, the Egyptian leader laid the blame for the incident on Israel. He said that when Israel ended its military occupation of southern Lebanon in May, ``it was agreed'' that 17 Lebanese citizens, apparently members of Hezbollah and other militant Islamic groups, would be released from Israeli prisons. Mubarak has also continued to give solid backing to Arafat in his refusal to accept American and Israeli proposals that would leave most of Jerusalem under Israeli sovereignty in a final peace agreement, the issue that sparked the current crisis. On Sunday, he said that ``not a single Arab country'' would accept Israeli sovereignty over Muslim holy sites in East Jerusalem, and he suggested that the problem could be solved with the concept of ``divine sovereignty'' over the Muslim and Jewish holy sites, with Palestinians being ``deputized'' to exercise the sovereignty. But he mocked suggestions that Arab nations have a military option, saying, ``Neither Israel nor its neighbors can afford a continuation of the drain of war.''

Two months after President Robert Mugabe bowed to election results and welcomed an opposition into the Parliament for the first time with promises of cooperation, relations have soured. The opposition leader warned Mugabe 10 days ago that if he didn't step aside, he would be ousted ``violently.'' On Monday, the government arrested three opposition members of Parliament on charges of inciting violence and sprayed tear gas on scores of their supporters, who sang and chanted outside the courthouse before scattering through clouds of choking smoke. Officials also vowed to arrest the opposition leader, Morgan Tsvangirai, on similar grounds. The police converged on the airport Monday morning, awaiting Tsvangirai's return from a trip to South Africa, but he managed to elude them and return home, where he held a news conference on his lawn. The opposition warned that arrests would only cause ``unnecessary conflict'' in the country. But neither side seemed willing to back down. The rising tensions reflect the hardening of political lines just two months after Zimbabwe's new opposition party, the Movement for Democratic Change, took its seats in Parliament, which had long been controlled by Mugabe under a virtual one-party system. In the first heady days of the opening session, there were handshakes and kisses in the elegant chamber and promises of cooperation across party lines. But the jubilation has given way to frustration, particularly among some supporters of the opposition party. At his news conference Monday, Tsvangirai was defiant. He emphasized that he was committed to upholding the law. But he said he did not regret making a recent speech in which he told Mugabe, ``if you don't want to go peacefully, we will remove you violently.'' ``I will be phoning the commissioner of police; I understand he's looking for me,'' Tsvangirai said as the cameras rolled. ``I have no regrets. It was a very stern warning. He either chooses to go peacefully or the people may resort to uprising.'' Meanwhile, government officials warned that the opposition politicians could be charged with treason, which carries a possible death sentence. ``He is a criminal,'' Jonathan Moyo, the minister of information, said of Tsvangirai in an interview Monday. ``He has violated the law. These people are not Martin Luther Kings. This is an organization full of individuals who will not hesitate to use violence.'' The Movement for Democratic Change, which won 57 of the 120 seats that were up for a vote in the June elections, is still outnumbered and outvoted by the governing party. The economy, which propelled most urban voters to abandon Mugabe's party, continues to unravel. The government continues to disregard court rulings and to suppress freedom of speech. Within the opposition, a small but vocal group is beginning to argue that the party should push the public to take to the streets and force Mugabe out of office before his term ends in 2002. Most opposition members still prefer to oppose the government in Parliament. And they insist that Tsvangirai's comment about an uprising was a slip of the tongue and not official policy. But Tsvangirai has not hesitated to compare Mugabe to Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia, who was forced out of power by popular will. And it is no secret that some opposition officials have been inspired by the events in Yugoslavia and now see popular protest as a way to bring an end to Mugabe's government after its 20 years in power. ``There is this push to have a popular revolution to oust the president, but that is not the way forward,'' said Alfred Nhema, a political analyst and the chairman of the political science department at the University of Zimbabwe.

Sirimavo Bandaranaike, the world's first female prime minister, died of a heart attack Tuesday after voting in parliamentary elections, a government spokeswoman said. Bandaranaije had retired at the age of 84 last month to let her daughter, President Chandrika Kumaratunga, appoint a hard-liner in the fight against Tamil separatists ahead of the elections. Bandaranaike had gone to Gampaha, her home town, 22 miles east of Colombo to cast her vote. She died on the way home, spokeswoman Kusum Rodrigo said. Born Sirimavo Ratwatte on April 17, 1916, Bandaranaike was a member of one of this Indian Ocean island's wealthiest families. In 1940 she married Soloman Dias Bandaranaike, a senior politician in the United National Party that was governing Sri Lanka, then called Ceylon. Breaking away to form his own Sri Lanka Freedom Party, her husband was elected prime minister in 1956. A deranged Buddhist monk assassinated him three years later. Bandaranaike was transformed from shy housewife into a political dynamo. She campaigned for her husband's party in the 1960 elections and became its leader. She was elected the first woman head of government on July 20, 1960, six years before Indira Gandhi became India's first woman prime minister. Her election was so unusual that newspapers weren't sure what to call her. ``There will be need for a new word. Presumably, we shall have to call her a Stateswoman,'' London's Evening News wrote July 21. ``This is the suffragette's dream come true. In September 1961 at the Neutral Summit Talks in Belgrade, Yugoslavia, she made history by being the first national leader to say she was speaking ``as a woman and a mother.'' She governed until 1965, lost the next elections, then regained power in 1970. Bandaranaike and Indira Gandhi had a strong personal rapport. Both lost their husbands at a young age and came from upper class families. Reflecting a shift toward the left, Bandaranaike ordered the U.S. Peace Corps out of the country in 1970 and closed the Israeli Embassy. In May 1972, Bandaranaike made the country a republic. During her second term she nationalized private companies, church schools and newspapers and banned imports. She used the military to crush a 1971 insurrection by Marxist rebels, and up to 20,000 are believed to have died. Parliament expelled her in 1980, accusing her of misusing power while prime minister, and banned her from office for seven years. Her civic rights were restored in 1986, and she narrowly lost the election for the new, more powerful post of president in 1988. Suffering from diabetes and a foot problem that put her in a wheelchair, Bandaranaike reduced her political activities. In 1993, Kumaratunga took over the party's leadership and when elected president a year later, she appointed her mother prime minister, now a mostly ceremonial post without administrative powers but carrying political clout with the people.

Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi was re-elected by acclamation Tuesday, winning another five-year term in a vote in the parliament dominated by his party. Meles' nomination by the ruling Ethiopian Peoples Revolutionary Democratic Front and his endorsement by the new parliament were expected. In May, the party captured 479 of 547 parliamentary seats in the second multiparty general elections in the country's history. With only four dissenting votes, parliament accepted his request to endorse his previous cabinet without any changes. In making the request, Meles emphasized the need to continue the peace process with Eritrea and relaunch development projects interrupted by the two-year Ethiopian-Eritrean war. ``The Ethiopian government is committed to a peaceful resolution of the conflict with Eritrea but the peace process will take weeks and months to conclude. The need for continuity is therefore essential,'' he said. In an opening speech to the new parliament Monday, President Negesso Ghidada expressed the government's belief that the border dispute and all other outstanding problems with Eritrea would be resolved peacefully. ``We are now at a time when efforts are made to demarcate the border in accordance with international law. Efforts are also being made to address other issues,'' Negesso said. An agreement on the cessation of hostilities signed by the two countries on June 18 is still holding, and the first 40 of 4,200 U.N. peacekeepers authorized by the Security Council have been deployed on both sides of the border. Another 150 troops will be dispatched this month, and the full force is expected by November.

I'm Dave Deforest, VOA News. The State Department says the United States will move very soon to lift economic sanctions against Yugoslavia as a show of support for its new President Vojislav Kostunica. The European Union acted to lift most of its sanctions, Monday. US officials say Washington's move to lift US sanctions against Yugoslavia will be harmonized with the steps taken by the EU. The officials also say the easing of the US sanctions could come as early as this week. State Department spokesman Richard Boucher says the US government also hopes to reestablish diplomatic relations with Belgrade. As far as reestablishing formal diplomatic relations, this is still being discussed with the new government. We will hope to do this soon as well. Mr. Boucher says a special Presidential Advisor on the Balkans James O'Brien will be in Belgrade this week for talks with President Kostunica.

US diplomacy in Yugoslavia is gaining momentum. Five days after the fall of Slobodan Milosevic, the United States is sending a senior envoy to Belgrade to start the process of resuming diplomatic relations with Yugoslavia and help jump-start the country's devastated economy. VOA's Nick Simeone has details at the State Department. Jim O'Brian, President Clinton's special advisor on democracy in the Balkans is heading to Yugoslavia for what will be the first high-level meeting with new President Vojislav Kostunica. The Clinton administration is anxious to get on with the process of lifting US sanctions against a country whose economy has been virtually ruined from repeated wars and embargoes imposed during the Milosevic years. State Department spokesmen Richard Boucher. We want to discuss how we can assist with the process of rebuilding and more generally with the process of integrating the new government in Serbia into international institutions. The European Union has already announced a partial lifting of sanctions and pledges of billions of dollars in development aid. Similar steps by Washington are expected soon. As far as re-establishing formal diplomatic relations, this is still being discussed with the new government. We would hope to do this soon, as well. The US embassy in Belgrade has been closed since before last year's NATO air war over Kosovo. President Kostunica opposes demands by prosecutors at the War Crimes Tribunal at the Hague that Slobodan Milosevic be extradited to stand trial for alleged atrocities carried out against ethnic Albanians in Kosovo province. A senior US official says the issue though is likely to be brought up with the new government in Belgrade in the coming days. Nick Simeone, VOA News at the State Department.

As Sri Lankans waited for the results of an election that could stop the 17-year civil war, they also grieved Tuesday for Sirimavo Bandaranaike, or ``Mrs. B,'' the matriarch of the nation's politics. Tens of thousands of people, including women in white saris and hundreds of saffron-robed Buddhist monks, grieved for Bandaranaike, 84, who died after casting her vote Tuesday. Shelling by Tamil Tiger rebels, election-eve killings and the death of Bandaranaike, 84, the world's first female prime minister and the mother of the current president cast a pall over the parliamentary elections. The government imposed a curfew in Colombo between 11 p.m. and 6 a.m. A bomb exploded minutes after voting ended, wounding 32 supporters of President Chandrika Kumaratunga's People's Alliance party at Ragama, 19 miles northeast of the capital, police said. One of the wounded was in critical condition. Police blamed the attack on political rivalry between Kumaratunga's party and that of her chief rival, the United National Party of former Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe. Kumaratunga, who did not issue a statement about her mother's death, sees the vote as a referendum on a proposed constitution that would give more power to Sri Lanka's north and east, where rebels are fighting for a homeland for the minority 3.2 million Tamils. The president, who lost an eye to a suicide bomber on Dec. 18, hopes the new constitution will win over moderate Tamils, dim the appeal of the militants and bring an end to the war, which has killed 63,000 people and displaced 1 million. Kumaratunga's People's Alliance took an early lead in postal ballots, which come from government or military officials or others posted in areas where they are not registered to vote, the Election Commission said Wednesday. The commission said it had counted 46,500 postal ballots. People's Alliance got 21,500 votes against 15,907 by the main opposition United National Party. While Sri Lankans wait for the election results, they have been requested to fly white flags in honor of their former prime minister, affectionately known as ``Mrs. B.'' She will be buried in a state funeral Saturday. Friday and Saturday have been declared days of mourning. Bandaranaike was elected prime minister July 20, 1960, six years before Indira Gandhi became the first woman leader of India. She regained the office for a third time in 1994 when her daughter appointed her prime minister, but retired in August to let Kumaratunga appoint a hard-liner ahead of the elections. Bandaranaike was replaced by Ratnasiri Wickramanayaka, who believes the rebels should be wiped out and that talks should only be held with moderate Tamils. Voters at the school where Bandaranaike cast her ballot Tuesday shortly before dying of a heart attack commented on her ``good fortune,'' rather than the ironic timing of her death. Sri Lankans, the majority of whom are believers of astrology, thought the stars had been on her side. Tuesday also marked the widow's 60th wedding anniversary. ``She was a very lucky woman,'' said 48-year-old T.K.H. Peiris, a polling agent. ``She had been sick so long, but it is amazing that she was able to cast her vote before she died.'' The race Tuesday was primarily between the two main parties: Kamaratunga's People's Alliance and former Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe's United National Party. A record 5,477 candidates were vying for 225 seats in parliament in the election. Wickremesinghe has said that if his United National Party comes into power, it would immediately de-escalate the fighting in the northern Jaffna Peninsula and then negotiate with the rebels. Several hours before news of Bandaranaike's death spread across this island nation off the southern tip of India, Tamil Tigers shelled an administrative center in Jaffna, which has been under siege since 1995. Just after the polls closed, the two leading parties leveled accusations of vote-rigging. The independent Center for Monitoring Election Violence urged the Elections Commissioner to annul the votes in at least 210 of the country's 9,500 polling centers. The opening of the vote was preceded by two attacks that left three people dead, including a 6-year-old daughter of a ruling party official, police said. The fatalities brought the total number of people killed in election violence to 66 since campaigning started five weeks ago. ___ On the Net: Tamil rebels: http://www.eelamweb.com Sri Lankan government: http://www.priu.gov.lk

President Chandrika Kumaratunga's governing party appeared poised Wednesday to win a majority of seats in parliamentary elections seen as a test of her proposals for ending Sri Lanka's devastating civil war. With 80 percent of the vote from Tuesday's elections counted by evening, Kumaratunga's Peoples' Alliance was leading with 70 seats in 15 districts, or 46 percent of the vote. The opposition United National Party had 58 seats, or 41 percent. The Peoples' Alliance needs at least 113 of the 225 seats in parliament to form a government. Under Sri Lanka's complex electoral system, seats are allocated based on the percentage of total votes polled by a party in each district. Tuesday's vote in this island nation off India's southern tip was a tumultuous one, marked by violence, death and bitter accusations. A day later, many people remained at home, monitoring state radio and television for results. Soldiers patrolled the capital with AK-47s slung over their shoulders, stopping cars at checkpoints. The driving political issue in the election was the bloody civil war between rebels of the Tamil minority and the majority Sinhalese-dominated government. Some 63,000 people have been killed in 17 years of violence. Seeking to placate Tamils and sideline rebel factions fighting for a separate homeland in the north, Kumaratunga _ who was blinded in one eye in a Tamil Tiger rebel suicide bombing Dec. 18 _ has pushed a new constitution that would give regional governments more power. Political disputes blocked her attempts to pass the constitution, and she sees Tuesday's vote as a referendum on the measure. Opposition leader Ranil Wickremesinghe has said his party would immediately de-escalate fighting and start talks with the Tamil Tigers if it were to take over the government. Final results, being counted by hand, were expected late Wednesday. The commission said it was delaying counting in four districts after poll monitors reported violence and fraud. At least 71 people were killed during the five-week campaign and on election day, according to the independent Center for Monitoring Election Violence. A bomb exploded minutes after voting ended, wounding 32 supporters of Kumaratunga's party at Ragama, northeast of the capital, police said. Seventy-five percent of the 12 million registered voters in this South Asian island nation of 18.6 million turned out, Elections Commissioner K. Senanayake said. The death of Kumaratunga's mother, former Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike, cast a pall over the vote. The 84-year-old Bandaranaike, who in 1960 became the world's first prime minister, died of a heart attack shortly after casting her vote Tuesday. A state funeral will be held Saturday. Bandaranaike was elected prime minister on July 20, 1960, six years before Indira Gandhi became India's first woman leader. Bandaranaike regained office a third time in 1994 when her daughter appointed her prime minister but retired in August to let the president appoint a hard-liner ahead of the elections. ``As the first democratically elected woman prime minister in the world, she made history and was an inspiration to the women of the world,'' India's President K.R. Narayanan said. ``It is appropriate that her last act was to cast her vote in the democratic elections being held in Sri Lanka.'' ___ On the Net: Tamil rebels: http://www.eelamweb.com Sri Lankan government: http://www.priu.gov.lk

This is The World, a co-production of the BBC World Service, PRI and WGBH in Boston. I am Tony Kahn. The drama in Yugoslavia seemed to climax last Thursday when hundreds of thousands of protesters forced the ouster of Slobodan Milosevic. But now the events of last week are beginning to look like act I. Talks today between supporters of Yugoslavia's new President Vojislav Kostunica and members of the Milosevic's Socialist party yielded more heat than light. Kostunica's people accused the Socialists of trying to hold on to the institutions of power and as if on queue, it was announced that a key Milosevic loyalist is taking over the interior ministry, which runs the police. The World's Nenad Chebeck is in Belgrade. Nenad, what do we know of this Milosevic ally? Well, it's Mirco Merianovic who officially still is the Prime Minister of Serbia. We have to keep one thing in mind that Vojislav Kostunica and the pro-democracy elements in Serbia and Yugoslavia have taken over authority on the Federal level, but the key leaders of power are on the Republican level. Yugoslavia consists of two Republics, Serbia and Montenegro and there were no elections for neither the Serbian Parliament, nor the presidency. So the Serbian government officially is still in place. But that's all theory, in practice things are slightly different. The whole structure of power in Serbia and Yugoslavia was based on one man, Milosevic. Once he collapsed, politically and he has collapsed when he resigned officially on national television, all the old structures of power collapsed together with him. Well, what other indications are there since, although, officially you got two different parallel governments going on, the reality is that Mr. Kostunica is trying to consolidate his power over Yugoslavia. What other indications are there that he is having trouble doing that? The taking over of all the leaders of power for Mr. Kostunica and his allies is a process which definitely takes time. Everybody is impatient, especially here in Belgrade and Serbia. The people that I see on the street and that I hear from are sick and tired of Milosevic cronies appearing on television protesting against this and trying to hang on to what ever little power they have at the moment. However, Mr. Kostunica and the Democratic Alliance of Serbia has said very openly today that they will not put up with this kind of behavior for much longer. They have indeed threatened Milosevic allies that they are going to bring out the people onto the streets again so that a completely new authority can be established. Not just on the Federal level, but also on the level of the Republic of Serbia. Let's talk a little bit also about other important policies of the government, of importance to people outside Yugoslavia, and that is Kosovo. There has been some news coming out that Yugoslav troops are going to return to Kosovo by the end of the year. What can you tell us about what this new government will do in that area? Well, it is a report that was brought by today's edition of Vetrivinia Novostate, a Belgrade newspaper. They quoted Zoran Zingic, one of the main leaders in the Democratic Alliance saying that Yugoslav troops and police will be policing the borders between Kosovo and other countries, meaning Macedonia and Albania. Basically it is not such a threatening sort of bit of a news as it might seem at the moment because the United Nations resolution, 1244, does actually provide for the presence of Yugoslav troops and police on the borders. That part of the resolution here and the resolution was never actually applied because right until now, the Yugoslav police and military were in the hands of Milosevic. So the international community didn't want to have anything to do with the Milosevic forces. Well, how is the international community dealing at this point with the change of the government? Who is there and what kind of assistance are they offering or what is the symbolic value of their being there at this point? Well, at the moment it is a race, who is going to get to Belgrade first. Yesterday, we had the French foreign minister, today we have Budor Homback, who is the head of the international community's stability pact for South East Europe. We also saw the American diplomat Willie Montgomery who arrived in Belgrade today to set up most probably a meeting between a senior U.S. official James O'Brien, who is coming to Belgrade, he will be here tomorrow as a special representative for President Clinton. He will hold talks, probably behind close doors, with President Vojislav Kostunica, but the United States is keeping a low profile because there is quite a lot of anti-American sentiment on the streets here in Serbia. So I believe that Washington realizes that very open support for Mr. Vojislav Kostunica could do the man more harm than good at this moment. The World's Nenad Chebeck in Belgrade. Thank you very much for speaking with us. You are welcome Tony.

With 27 days to go in the US presidential campaign, the two major candidates are about to meet in the second of three debates. Just a moment from now, we will bring it you, live from Wakeforest University. Hello, I'm Kent Kline in Washington. With millions of Americans watching on television, Vice-President Al Gore, the Democratic Party candidate will try to reverse the small lead that Republican George W. Bush well, the governor of Texas has built into public opinion polls. I'm joined by VOA National correspondent Jim Malone and our political commentator, Professor Ron Walters of the University of Marilyn. Jim, what should we look for in this debate? Well, Kent this race is settling into a choice in some ways between character and competence. Professor Walters, what do you think we should be looking for? Well, I think depending upon who comes out ahead in this race. We will all be trying to evaluate the impact of this new format on the result. Thanks, we will be checking back with both of you after the debate. Now, this debate will run approximately 90 minutes and the format will differ somewhat from that of the first debate, as we will hear in just a moment. Just a reminder that you can find our audio and video streams at www.voa.gov/newsnow. Now, we take you to Winston-Salem and the moderator, journalist Jim Lair. Greetings form Lee Chapel at Wakeforest University at Winston-Salem, North Carolina, I'm Jim Lair at the New Hours on PBS. Welcome, to the second election 2000 debate between the Republican candidate for President, Governor George W. Bush of Texas and the Democratic candidate, Vice-President Al Gore. These debates are sponsored by the Commission on Presidential debates. The format and the rules are those negotiated by representatives of the two campaigns. Only, the subjects tonight and the questions are mine. The format tonight is that of a conversation. The only prevailing rule is that no single response can ever, ever exceed two minutes. The prevailing rule for the audience here in the hall is as always, absolute quiet, please. Good evening Governor Bush, Vice-President Gore. In about 90 minutes, last week in Boston, the total time each of you took was virtually the same. Lets see if we can do the same tonight or come close. Governor Bush, the first question goes to you. One of you is about to be elected, the leader of the single most powerful nation in the world, economically, financially, militarily, diplomatically, you name it. Have you formed any guiding principles for exercising this enormous power? I have, I have. First question is what's in the best interests of the United States. What's in the best interests of our people. When it comes to foreign policy, that will be my guiding question. Is it in our nation's interests? Peace in the Middle East is in our nation's interests. Having a hemisphere that is free for trade and peaceful, is in our nation's interests. Strong relations in Europe is in our nation's interests. I have thought a lot about what it means to be the President. I also understand that an administration is not one person, but an administration is dedicated citizens who are called by the President to serve the country, to serve a cause greater than self. And, so I have thought about an administration of people who represent all America. The people understand by compassionate and conservative philosophy. I haven't started naming any names, except for one person. That's Mr. Richard Cheney who I thought did a great job the other night. He is a vice-Presidential nominee, who represents, who, I think people got to see why I picked him. He is a man of solid judgment and he is going to be a person to stand by my side. One of the things that I've done in Texas is I have been able to put together a good team of people. I have been able to set clear goals. The goals are to be an education system that leaves no child behind, medicare for seniors, a social security system that's safe and secure, foreign policy that's in our nation's interest and a strong military. And then bring people together to achieve those goals. That's what our chief executive officer does. So I have thought long and hard about the honor of being the President of the United States. Vice-President Gore. Yes Jim, I've thought a lot about that particular question and I see our greatest national strength coming from what we stand for in the world. I see it as a question of values. It is a great tribute to our founders that 224 years later, this nation is now looked to by the peoples on every continent and the peoples from every part of this earth, as a kind of model for what their future could be. And, I don't think that's just the kind of exaggeration that we take pride in as Americans, that's really true. Even the one that some times shake their fist at us. As soon as they have a change that allows the people to speak freely, they're wanting to develop some kind of a blueprint that will help them be like us more, freedom, free markets, political freedom. So, I think first and foremost, our power ought to be wielded in ways that form a more perfect union. The power of example is America's greatest power in the world. And that means, for example, standing up for human rights. It means addressing the problems of injustice and inequity along lines of the race and ethnicity here at home, because in all these other places around the world where they're having these terrible problems, when they feel hope, it is often because they see in us a reflection of their potential. So, we've got to enforce our Civil Rights Laws. We've got to deal with things like racial profiling. And, we have to keep our military strong. We have the strongest military and I'll do what ever is necessary, if I'm President to make sure that it stays that way. But, our real power comes, I think, from our values. Should the people of the world look at the United States, Governor and say, should they fear us, should they welcome our involvements? Do they see us as a friend, everybody in the world? How do you, how would you project us around the world as President? Well, I think they all look at us as a country that understands freedom. It doesn't matter who you are or how you're raised or where you're from, that you can succeed. I don't think they will look at us with envy. It really depends upon how our nation conducts itself in foreign policy. If we are an arrogant nation, they will resent us. If we are a humble nation, but strong, they will welcome us. And our nation stands alone, right now in the world in terms of power. And that's why we've got be humble and yet project strength in a way that promotes freedom. So, I don't think they look at us in anyway other than what we are. We're a freedom-loving nation and if we're an arrogant nation, they'll view us that way. But, if we are a humble nation, they'll respect us. A humble nation? I agree with that. I agree with that. I think, that one of the problems that we have faced in the world is that we are so much more powerful than any single nation has been in relationship to the rest of the world that at any time in history that I know about, anyway, that there is some resentment of U.S. power. So, I think that the idea of humility is an important one. But, I think that we also have-to-have a sense of mission in the world. We have to protect our capacity to push forward what America is all about. That means not only military strength and our values. It also means keeping our economy strong. You know, in the last two decades ago, it was routine for leaders of foreign countries to come over here and say "you guys have got to do something about these horrendous deficits, because it's causing tremendous problems for the rest of the world." And we were lectured to all the time. The fact that we have the strongest economy in history today is not good enough. We need to do more, but the fact that it is so strong, enables us to project the power for good that America can represent. Does our wealth, our good economy, our power bring with it special obligations to the rest of the world? Yes, it does. Take for example third-world debt, I think, we ought be forgiving third-world debt under certain conditions. I think for example, if we are convinced that a third-world country that has got a lot of debt would reform itself, that the money wouldn't go into the hands of a few, but would go to help people, then I think it makes sense for us to use our wealth in that way. We have already traded debt for valuable rain forest lands, makes eminent sense. Yes, we do have an obligation. But, we can't be all things to all people. We can help build . We can lend money, but we've got to do it wisely. We shouldn't be lending money to corrupt officials, so we got to be guarded in our generosity. Let's go through some of the specifics now. New question, vice President Gore, the governor mentioned Middle East. Here we are talking at this stage in the game about diplomatic power that we have. Uh-huh. What do you think the United States should do right now to resolve that conflict over there. The first priority has to be on ending the violence, dampening down the tensions that have risen there. We need to call upon Syria to release the three Israeli soldiers who have been captured and we need to insist that Arafat send out instructions to halt some of the provocative acts of violence that have been going on. I think that we also have to keep a weather eye toward the Sadam Hussain, because he is taking advantage of the situation to once again make threats and he needs to understand that he is not only dealing with Israel, he is dealing with us if he is making the kind of threats that he is talking about there. The use of diplomacy in this situation has already, well it goes hour-by-hour and day-by-day now, it's a very tense situation there, but in the last 24 hours there has been some subsiding of the violence there. It's too much to hope that this is going to continue, but I do hope that it will continue. Our country has been very active with the regular conversations with the leaders there and we just have to take it day-to-day right now, but one thing I would say where diplomacy is concerned, Israel should feel absolutely secure about one thing. Our bonds with Israel are larger than agreements or disagreements on some details of diplomatic initiatives. They are historic, they are strong and they are enduring and our ability to serve as an honest broker is something that we need to shapeup. Governor? Well, I think during the campaign, particularly now during this difficult period we've got to be speaking with one voice and I appreciate the way the administration has worked hard to calm the tensions, like the Vice President had called on Chairman Arafat to have his people pull back to make the peace. I think credibility is going to be very important in the future in the Middle East. I want everybody to know should I be the President, Israel is going to be our friend and will stand by Israel. Secondly, that I think it's important to reach out to moderate Arab nations, like Jordan, and Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and Kuwait. It's important to be friends with people when you know you need each other, so that when you do there is a strong bond of friendship and that's going to be particularly important in dealing not only with situations such as now occurring in Israel, but with Sadam Hussian. The coalition against Sadam has fallen apart, or it's unraveling to put it that way. The sanctions are being violated. There is, we don't know whether he is developing weapons of mass destruction. He better not be or there is going to be a consequence, should I be the President, but it's important to have credibility and credibility is formed by being strong with your friends and resolute in your determination. It's one of the reasons why I think it's important for this nation to develop an antiballistic missile system and that we can share with our allies in the Middle East if need be to keep the peace, to be able to say to the Sadam Hussains of the world or the Iranians "don't dare threaten our friends." It's also important to keep strong ties in the Middle East, credible ties, because of the energy crisis we're now in. After all, all the energy is produced from the Middle East and so I appreciate what the administration is doing and I hope you get a sense of, should I be fortunate to be the President, how my administration will react to Middle East. So, you don't believe, Vice President Gore, that we should take sides in this and resolve this right now. Lot of people are pushing "hey, we, the United States should declare itself and not be so neutral in this particular situation." Well, we stand with Israel, but we have maintained the ability to serve as an honest broker and one of the reasons that's important is that Israel cannot have direct dialogue with some of the people on the other side of conflicts especially during times of tension unless that dialogue comes through us. And if we throw away that ability to serve as an honest broker then we would have thrown away a strategic asset that's important not only to us, but also to Israel. You agree with that? You are listening to the US Presidential candidates debate, live from Winston-Salem, North Carolina on VOA News Now. Discussions take place, there has got to be a timetable that all parties can agree to, you know, like the Palestinians and Israelis. Secondly, any lasting peace is going to have to be a peace that's good for both sides and therefore the term "honest broker" makes sense whether this current administrations work hard to keep the parties at the table. I would try to do the same thing, but it won't be on my timetable. It will be on a timetable that people are comfortable with in the Middle East. People watching here tonight are very interested in Middle East policy and they are so interested that they want to make a, they want to base their vote on differences between the two of you as President, how you would handle Middle East policy. Is there any difference? I haven't heard a big difference right in the last few exchanges. Well, I know it's hard to tell. I think that you know I would hope to be able to convince people, I could handle the Iraqi situation better. With Sadam Hussain, you mean? Yes, and I can . You can get him out of there? I'd like to, of course, and I presume this administration would as well, but we don't know, there is no inspectors now in Iraq, the coalition that was in place isn't as strong as it used to be. He is the danger. We don't want him fishing in troubled waters in the Middle East, because it's going to be hard to- it's going to be important to rebuild that coalition to keep the pressure on him. You feel that as the failure of the Clinton administration? i do. Well, when I got to be a part of the current administration, it was right after I was one of the few members of my political party to support former President Bush in the Persian-Gulf war resolution. And at the end of that war, for whatever reasons, it was not finished in a way that removed Sadam Hussain from power. I know there are all kinds of circumstances and explanations, but the fact is that that's the situation that was left when I got there and we have maintained the sanctions. Now I want to go further, I want to give robust support to the groups that are trying to overthrow Sadam Hussain and I know their allegations that they are too weak to do it, but that's what they said about the forces that were opposing Milosevic in Serbia. And, you know, the policy of enforcing sanctions against Serbia has just resulted in a spectacular victory for democracy just in the past week and it seems to me that having taken so long to see the sanctions work there, building upon the policy of containment that was successful over a much longer period of time against the former Soviet Union in the communist block seems a little early to declare that we should give up on the sanctions. I know the governor is not necessarily saying that, but you know, all of these flights that have come in, all of them have been in accordance with the sanctions regime I am told, except for three where they notified and they are trying to break out of the box, there is no question about it. I don't think they should be allowed to. Did he correct you, did he state your position correctly, you are not calling for eliminating the sanctions are you. No of course not, absolutely not. I want to be tougher. Let's go on to Milosevic and Yugoslavia and it falls into the area of our military power, Governor. New question, should the fall of Milosevic be seen as a triumph for U.S. military intervention? I think it's a triumph, I thought the President made the right decision in joining NATO and bombing Serbia. I supported him when they did so, I called upon the Congress not to hamstring the administration and in terms of forcing troop withdrawals on a timetable that wasn't in necessarily our best interests or fit our nation's strategy. Hence I think, it's good public policy, I think, it worked and I am pleased I took this - made the decision I made, and pleased that the President made the decision he made, because freedom took hold in that part of the world and where there is a lot of work left to be done, however. But you think it would not have happened, do you think that Milosevic would not have fallen if the United States and NATO had not intervened militarily? Is this a legitimate use of our military power? Yes I think it is, absolutely, I don't think he would have fallen had we not used force and I know there are some in my party that disagreed with that sentiment, but I supported the President, I thought he made the right decision to do so. I didn't think he necessarily made the right decision to take land troops off the table right before we committed ourselves offensively, but nevertheless it worked. The administration deserves credit for having made it work. It's important for NATO to have it work. It's important for NATO to be strong and confident to help keep the peace in Europe and one of the reasons I felt so strongly that the United States needed to participate, was because of our relations with NATO and NATO is going to be an important part of keeping the peace in the future. And there is more work to do, or may as we have seen how whether or not it is going to be a political settlement to Kosovo and I certainly hope there is one. I have also on record of saying at some point time I hope our European friends become the peacekeepers in Bosnia and in the Balkans. I hope that they put the troops on the ground, so that we can withdraw our troops and focus our military on fighting and winning war. Well, I've been kind of a hard liner on this issue for more than eight years when I was in the Senate, before I became Vice President. I was pushing for stronger action against Milosevic, he caused the deaths of so many people, he was the last communist party boss there and then he became a dictator, that by some other label he was still essentially a communist dictator and unfortunately now he is trying to reassert himself in Serbian politics already. Just today the members of his political party said that they were going to ignore the orders of the new President of Serbia and that they questioned his legitimacy and he is still going to try to be actively involved. He is an indited war criminal. He should be held accountable. Now I did want to pick up on one of the statements earlier and maybe I have heard the previous statements wrong, governor. I some of the discussions we've had about when it's appropriate for the US to use force around the world, at times the standards that you've laid down have given me the impression that if it's something like a genocide taking place or what they called ethnic cleansing in Bosnia, that that wouldn't be the kind of situation that would cause you to think that the US ought to get involved with troops. Now, there have to be other factors involved for me to want to be involved, but by itself that to me, it can bring into play a fundamental American strategic interest, because I think it's based on our values, now have I got that wrong? All right, sir. Okay, yeah. Trying to figure out of what the question was. All right, yeah. If I think it's in our nations strategic interest I will commit truce. I thought it was in our strategic interests to keep Milosevic in check, because of our relations in NATO and that's why I took the position I took and I think it's important for NATO to be strong and confident. I felt like an unchecked Milosevic would harm NATO and it so depends on the situation Mr. Vice President. Well, let's keep for a moment. New question related to this, I figured this out, in the last 20 years there have been eight major actions involving introduction of US ground, air or naval forces. I mean in Lebanon, Grenada, Panama, the Persian, Gulf, Somalia, Bosnia, Haiti, Kosovo. If you had been President , any of those interventions, would any of those interventions not have happened? Can you run through the list again? Sure, Lebanon? I thought that was a mistake. Grenada? I support that. Panama? I support them. Persian Gulf? Yes I voted for it, supported it. Somalia? Of course and that again, no I think that that was ill-considered. I did support it at the time, it was in the previous administration, in the Bush-Quaill administration and I think in retrospect the lessons there are ones that we should take very, very seriously. Bosnia? Oh yes. Haiti? yes. And in Kosovo, we talked about that. yes. Want me to do with you? no. You want to go, be Lebanon? I'll make it cut short. Absolutely, sure. Somalia, started off as a humanitarian mission, then changed into a nation building mission and that's where the mission went wrong. The mission was changed and as a result our nation paid a price and so I don't think our troops ought to be used for what's called nation building and our troops are be used to fight and win war. I think our troops are be used to help overthrow a dictator when it's in our best interest. But in this case, it was a nation building exercise and same with Haiti, I wouldn't have supported either. What about Lebanon? yes. Grenada? yes. Panama? yes. Obviously the first. Someone might get a conflict of interest on, if you know what I mean. i do, i do. You are, the Persian Gulf obviously, and Yeah. And Bosnia and you've already talked about, about Kosovo, but the reverse side of the question, Governor, that vice President Gore mentioned. When 600,000 people died and in Rwanda 1994, there was no U.S. intervention and no intervention from the outside world. Was that a mistake, not to intervene? I think the administration did the right thing in that case, I do. It was a horrible situation, no one liked to see it on our TV screens, but it's a case where we need to make sure we've got a you know, a kind of an early warning system in place, in places where there could be ethnic cleansing and genocide the way we saw there in Rwanda, and that's a case where we need to, you know, use our influence to have countries in Africa come together and help deal with this situation. Administration last night, but the administration made the right decision on training Nigerian troop for situations just such as this in Rwanda, and so I thought they made the right decision not to send US troops into Rwanda. Do you have any second thoughts on that based on what you said a moment ago about genocide? I would like to come back to the question of nation building, but let me address this question directly first, fine. We did actually send troops into Rwanda to help with humanitarian relief measures, my wife Tipper who is here actually went on a military plane with General Shalikashvili on one of those flights, but I think in retrospect we were too late getting in there, we could've saved more lives, if we had acted earlier, but I do not think that it was an example of a conflict, where we should've put our troops in to try to separate the parties for this reason Jim. One of the criteria that I think is important in deciding when and if we should ever get involved around the world is whether or not our national security interest is involved, if we can really make the difference with military force, if we tried everything else, if we have allies. In the Balkans we had allies, NATO, ready, willing and able to go and carry a big part of the burden. In Africa, we did not, now our country has tried to create an Africa crisis response team there and we met some resistance. We have had somewhat with Nigeria, but in Sierra Leone and that now Nigeria has become a democracy we hope it stays that way, then maybe we can build on that. But because we had no allies and because it was very unclear that we could actually accomplish what we would want to accomplish about putting military forces there up, I think it was the right thing not to jump in, as heart breaking as it was, but I think we should've come in much quicker with the humanitarian mission. So what would you say Governor, to somebody who would say "Hey, wait a minute, why not Africa, tell me why the Middle East, why the Balkans, but not Africa when 600,000 people's lives are at risk? Oh, I understand and Africa is important and we got to do lot of work in Africa to promote democracy and trade and as Vice President mentioned Nigeria is a fledgling democracy, we've to work with Nigeria. It's an important continent, but there is got to be priorities and Middle East is a priority for a lot of reasons, as is Europe and the Far East in our own hemisphere and those are my four top priority, should I be the President, not to say we won't be engaged, nor should we work hard to get other nations to come together to prevent atrocity, I thought the best example of a way to handle a situation as each team, was when we provided logistical support to the Australians, support that only we can provide. I thought that was a good model, but we can't be all things to all people in the world Jim, and I think that's where maybe the Vice President and I begin to have differences, I am worried about over committing our military around the world, I want to be judicious in its use. You've mentioned Haiti. I wouldn't have sent troops to Haiti. I did not think it was a mission worthwhile, it was a nation building mission and it was not very successful, it cost us billions, couple of billions of dollars and I am not so sure democracy is any better off in Haiti than it was before. Vice President, would you agree with the Governor's views on national building, the use of military ... This is VOA News Now from Washington with live coverage of the U.S. Presidential candidates' debate from Winston-Salem, North Carolina. And evaluating any potential use of American troops overseas. I think we have to be very reticent about that. But, look Jim the world is changing and so rapidly the way I see it, the world is getting much closer together. Like it or not, we are now, the United States is now the natural leader of the world. All these other countries are looking to us. Now, just because we cannot be involved everywhere and shouldn't be doesn't mean that we should shy away both of us are kind of, I guess stating the other's position in a maximalistic stream way but I think there is a difference here. This idea of nation building is a kind of a pejorative phrase, but think about the great conflict of the past century World War-II. During the years between World War-I and World War-II, a great lesson was learnt by our military leaders and the people of the United States. The lesson was that in the aftermath of World War-I, we kind of turned our backs and left them to their own devices and they brewed up a lot of trouble that quickly became World War-II, and acting upon that lesson in the aftermath of our great victory in World War-II, we laid down the Marshall plan, President Truman did. All right, we got intermittently involved in building NATO and other structures there. We still have lots of troops in Europe and what did we do in the late 40s and 50s and 60s. We were nation building and it was economic, but it was also military and the confidence that those countries, recovering from the wounds of war had by having troops that, we had civil administrators come in to set up their ways of building their towns back. Yes, but you said in the Boston debate Governor on this issue of nation building, that the Unites States military is overextended now. Where is it overextended? Where are the US military that you would bring home if you become President. Well, first let me just say one comment about what the Vice-President said. I think one of the lessons in between World War-I and World War-II is we let our military atrophy and we can't do that. We got to rebuild our military. But, one of the problems we have in the military is we're in a lot of places around the world and I mentioned one that's the Balkans, I'd very much like to get our troops out of there. I recognize we can't do it now, nor do I advocate an immediate withdrawal, I think that would be an abrogation of our agreement with NATO. No one is suggesting that, but I think it ought to be one of our priorities to work with our European friends to convince them to put troops on the ground and there is an example, Haiti is another example and now there are some places where I think you know, I supported the administration in Colombia, I think it's importance for us to be training Colombians in that part of the world, it's for hemisphere's interest to have a peaceful Colombia, but.. Use of the military. There are some people who are now suggesting that if you don't want to use the military to maintain the peace to do the simple things, is it time to consider a civil force of some kind that comes in after the military that builds nation or all of that. Is that on your radar screen. I don't think so. I think what we need to do is convince people who live in the lands they live in to build the nations. May be I'm missing something here, I mean you going to have a nation building core from America? Absolutely not, our military is meant to fight and win war. That's what it's meant to do and when it gets overextended, morale drops and I'm not, Jim I strongly believe we need to have a military presence in the Greek Peninsula not only to keep the peace in the peninsula but to keep regional stability and I strongly believe we need to keep our presence in NATO. But, I'm going to be judicious as to how to use the military and these being in our vital interest, the mission needs to be clear and the extra strategy obvious. Well, I don't disagree with that and I certainly don't disagree that we are to get our troops home from places like the Balkans as soon as we can, as soon as the mission is complete, that's what we did in Haiti. There are no more than a handful of American military personnel in Haiti now and Haitians have their problems, but we gave them a chance to restore democracy and that's really about all we can do. But, if you have a situation like that right in our backyard, with chaos about to break out and flotillas forming to come across the water and all kinds of violence there, right in one of our neighboring countries there, then I think that we did the right thing there and as for this idea of nation building, the phrase sounds grandiose and you know, we can't be, we can't allow ourselves to get overextended. I certainly agree with that and that's why I've supported building up our capacity, I have devoted in the budget I've proposed, as I said last week, more than twice as much as the Governor has proposed. I think that it's in better shape now than he generally does. We've had some disagreements about that and he said that two divisions would have to report not ready for duty and as that we have to continue building up readiness and military strength and we have to also be very cautious in the way we use our military. In the non-military area of influencing events around the world, the financial and economic area, World Bank President Wolfenson said recently, Governor that US contributions to overseas development and assistance is lower now almost than it has ever been. Is that a problem for you, do you think, what is your idea about what the United States' obligations are? I'm talking about financial assistance and that sort of thing to other countries, the poor countries? Well, I mentioned third world that's a place where we can use our generosity to influence in a positive way, influence nations. I believe we ought to have foreign aid, but I don't think we all just have foreign aid for the sake of foreign aid. I think foreign aid needs to be used to encourage markets and reform. I think a lot of times we just spend aids and say we just would feel better about it, ends up being spent the wrong way and there are some pretty egregious examples recently, one being Russia where we had IMF loans that end up in the pockets of a lot of powerful people and didn't the helped the nation. I think the IMF has got a role in the world, but I don't want to see the IMF out there as a way to say to world bankers, "if you make a bad loan, we'll bail you out". And these have been available for emergency situations. I thought the President did the right thing with Mexico and was very strongly supportive with the administration in Mexico. But, I don't think the IMF ought to be a stop loss for people who aren't be able to evaluate risk themselves. So, I look at every place where we are investing money. I just want to make sure the return is good. You think we're meeting our obligations properly? No, I would make some changes. I think there need to be reforms in the IMF. I've generally supported it, but I have seen them make some calls that I thought were highly questionable and I think that there is the general agreement in many parts of the world now that there are to be changes in the IMF. The World Bank, I think is generally doing a better job. But, I think one of the big issues here that doesn't get nearly enough attention is the issue of corruption. The Governor mentioned it earlier, I've worked on this issue, it's an enormous problem and corruption in official agencies like militaries and police departments around the world, customs officials. That's one of the worst forms of it and we have got to again lead by example and help these other countries that are trying to straighten out their situations, find the tools in order to do it. I just think Jim, that this is an absolute unique period in world history. The world is coming together as I said, they are looking to us and we have a fundamental choice to make. Are we going to step up to the play as the nation, the way we did after World War-II. The way that generation of heroes said, "okay, the United States is going to be the leader", and the world benefited tremendously from the courage that they showed in those post war years. I think that in the aftermath of the cold war, it's time for us to do something very similar to step up to the play to provide the leadership, leadership on the environment, leadership to make sure the world economy keeps moving in the right direction. Again, that means not running big deficits here and not squandering our surplus, that means having intelligent decisions that keep our prosperity going and keep in shape that economic shrink so that we can provide that leadership role. Let me comment on that. Sure. Yeah. I'm not so sure the role of the United States is to go around the world and say this is the way it's got to be. We can help and maybe it's just our difference in government. The way we do government, I mean, I want empower people, I don't, you know, I want to help people help themselves not have government tell people what to do. I just don't think it's the role of the United States to walk into a country say, "we do it way, so should you". And, I think we can help, and I know we've got to encourage democracy in the market places. You take Russia for example. We went into Russia, we said, here sir, I have made money, that ended up in Victor Chernomyrdin's pocket and others and yet we played like there is reform. The only people who are going to reform Russia are Russians. They are going to have to make the decision themselves. Mr. Putin is going to have to make the decision as to whether or not he wants to adhere to real law and normal accounting practices, so that if countries and or entities invest capital, there is a reasonable rate of return, a way to get the money out of the economy, but Russia has to make the decision. We can work with them on security matters for example, but it's their call to make. So, I am not exactly sure where the Vice President is coming from, but I think one way for us to end up being viewed as the ugly American is for us to go around the world saying, "we do it this way, so should you." Now, we trust freedom, we know freedom is a powerful force much bigger than the United States of America, as we saw recently in the Balkans, but may be I am misunderstanding where your are coming from, Mr. Vice-President, but I think the United States must be humble and must be proud and confident of our values, but humble in how we treat nations that are figuring out how to chart their own course. Let's move on. All right, no, lets move on. Far be it for me to suggest otherwise. First, a couple of follow-ups from the vice Presidential debate last week. Vice-President Gore, would you support or sign as President of federal law banning racial profiling by police and other authorities at all levels of government. Yes, I would. The only thing an executive order can accomplish is to ban it in federal law enforcement agencies, but I would also support a law in the Congress that would have the effect of doing the same thing. I think that racial profiling is a serious problem. I remember when the stories first came out about the stops in New Jersey about the highway patrol there and I know it's been going on a long time, in some ways this is just a new label for something that's been going on for years, but I have to confess that it was the first time that I've really focussed on it in a new way and I was surprised at the extent and I think we now got so many examples around the country that we really have to find ways to end this. Imagine, what it is like for someone to be singled out unfairly, unjustly, and feel the unfair force of law simply because of race or ethnicity. Now, that runs counter to what the United States of America is all about at our core and it's not an easy problem to solve, but if I am entrusted with the presidency, it will be the first civil rights act of the 21st century. Yeah, I can imagine what it would be like to be singled out because of race and stopped and harassed, it's just very wrong and that's not what America is all about and so we have to do everything we can to end racial profiling. One of my concerns though is I don't want to federalize the local police forces, I want to, obviously in egregious cases we need to enforce civil rights law, but we need to make sure that internal affairs division at the local level do their job and be given a chance to do their job. I believe in local control of governments and obviously if they don't there needs to be a consequence at the federal level, but it's very important that we not overstep our bounce and I think, most people, most police officers are good, dedicated, honorable citizens who are doing their job, putting their lives at risk, who aren't bigoted or aren't prejudiced, I don't think they are to be held guilty, but I do think we need to find out where racial profiling occurs and do something about it and say to the local folks, "get it done and if you can't, there will be federal consequence". And that could be a federal law? Yeah. And you agree? I would agree and I also agree that most police officers of course, are doing a good job and hate this practice also. I talked to an African-American police officer in Springfield, Massachusetts not long ago, who raised this question and said one of the biggest solutions was in the training and not only the training in police procedures, but human relations. And I think that racial profiling is part of a larger issue, how we deal with race in America and as for singling people out, because of race, you know James Bird was singled out because of his race in Texas and other Americans have been singled out because of... This is VOA News Now, bringing you live coverage of the U.S. Presidential candidates' debate from Winston-Salem, North Carolina. Our values by passing a hate crimes law. I think these crimes are different. I think they are different because they are based on prejudice and hatred, which gives rise to crimes that have not just a single victim, but they are intended to stigmatize and dehumanize a whole group of people. Do you have a different view of that? No, I don't really, on hate crimes law, we got one in Texas and guess what, the three men who murdered James Bird, guess what's going to happen to them. They are going to be put to death. A jury found them guilty and it's going to be hard to punish them any worse after they get put to death and it is the right cause, so it's the right decision. And secondly, there is other forms of racial profiling that goes on in America. Arab-Americans are racially profiled on what's called "secret evidence." People are stopped and we've got to do something about that. My friend, Senator Spencer Abraham, of Michigan is pushing a law to make sure that Arab-Americans are treated with respect. So, racial profiling isn't just an issue with local police forces, it's an issue throughout our society and as we become a diverse society, we're going to have to deal with it more and more. I believe, sure as I'm sitting here, that most Americans really care, they are tolerant people, a good tolerant people. It is the very few that create most of the crises and we just have to find them and deal with them. What, if you become President, Governor, are there other areas, racial problem areas, which you would deal with as President, involving discrimination. Sure. As you just said Arab-Americans, but also Hispanics, Asians, as well as blacks in this country. Let me tell where the biggest discrimination comes, in public education, when we just move children through the schools. My friend Phyllis Horners here, she had won the greatest lions of all lions. She said reading is the new civil right, and she is right, and to make sure our society is as hopeful as it possibly can be, every single child in America must be educated, I mean, every child. It starts with making sure every child learns to read K through two diagnostic testing so we know whether or not there is a deficiency. Curriculum that works and phonetics needs to be an integral part of our reading curriculum. Tested reading laboratories, teacher re-training, and there needs to be a wholesale effort against racial profiling, which is their literate children. We can do better in our public schools. We can close our achievement gap and it starts with making sure we have strong accountability, Jim. One of the cornerstones of reform, and good reform, is to measure, because when you measure you can ask the question, do they know? Is anybody being profiled? Is anybody being discriminated against it? It becomes a tool, a corrective tool, and I believe the federal government must say that if you receive any money, any money from the federal government for disadvantaged children for example, you must show us whether or not the children are learning; and if they are, fine and if they are not, there has to be a consequence. And so, to make sure we end up, we are getting rid of the basic structural prejudice, is education. There is nothing more prejudiced than not educating a child. Vice President Gore, what would be on your racial discrimination elimination list as President? Well, I think we need tough enforcement of the civil rights laws, I think we still need affirmative action, I would pass, say hate crimes laws, I said and I guess I had misunderstood the Governor's previous position, the Bird family may have a misunderstanding of it in Texas also, but I would like to shift if I could, to quit the biggest ... Hold on one second. What is the misunderstanding? Let's clear this out. Well, I had thought that there was a controversy at the end of the legislative session where the hate crimes law in Texas was failed and that the Bird family among others asked you to support it, the Governor, and it died in committee for lack of support, am I wrong about that? Well, you don't realize we have a hate crimes statute over here? I'm talking about the one that was proposed to deal. What the Vice-President must now understand is we've got hate crimes bill in Texas, and secondly, the people that murdered Mr. Bird got the ultimate punishment, the death penalty. They were prosecuted under murder laws, were they not? We'll check this out. Well, in this case, when you murder somebody, it's hate, Jim. The crime is hate and they got the ultimate punishment. I'm not exactly sure how you'd enhance the penalty any more than the death penalty, but we haven't had the statute on the books, that hate crime statute in Texas. May I respond? Sure. I don't want to jump, you know. I may have been misled by all the news reports about this matter, because the law that was proposed in Texas, that has the support of the Bird family and a whole lot of people in Texas did in fact die in committee. There may be some other statute that was already on the books, but certainly the advocates of the hate crimes law felt that, a tough new law was needed and it's important Jim, not only not just because of Texas, but because this mirrors the national controversy. There is pending now in the Congress, a national hate crimes law because of James Bird, because of Matthew Shephard who was crucified on a split rail fence by bigots, because of others and that law has died in committee also because of the same kind of opposition. And you would support that? Absolutely. Would you support a national hate crimes law? I would support the Owen Hats version of it, not the Senator Kennedy version, but let me say to you, Mr. Vice President, we are happy with our laws and our books, that bill did. There was another bill that did die in committee. But I want to repeat, if you have a state that fully supports the law, like we do in Texas, we are going to after all crime. And we are going to make sure people get punished for the crime and in this case, we can't enhance the penalty anymore than putting those three thugs to death. And that's what's going to happen in the state of Texas. New subject, new question, another vice Presidential debate follow up. Governor, both Senator Lieberman and Secretary Cheney said they were sympathetically rethinking their views on same sex relationships. What's your position on that? I'm not for gay marriage. I think marriage is a sacred institution between a man and a woman and I appreciate the way the administration signed the Defense of Marriage Act, I presume the Vice-President supported when the President signed that bill, supports it now. But, I think the marriage is sacred institution and will be respectful. For people who may disagree with me, I have had a record of doing so in the state of Texas. I have been a person that would been called the uniter not divider because I accept other people's points of view, but I feel strongly that marriage should be a between a man and woman. Vice-President Gore? I agree with that and I did support that law. But, I think that we should find a way to allow some kind of civic unions and I basically agree with Dick Cheney, and Joe Lieberman and I think that three of us have one view, and the Governor has another. Is that right? I'm not sure what kind of views describe you to me, I will just tell you, I'm a person who respects other people. I respect their, I respect, one he says he agrees with me and then he says he doesn't, I'm not sure where he is coming from. But I will be a tolerant person, I have been a tolerant person all my life. I just happen to believe strongly that marriage is between a man and woman. Do you believe, in general terms that gays and lesbians should have the same rights as other Americans? Yes, I don't think they have any special rights but I think they will all have the same rights. Well, there is a law pending called the employment non-discrimination act. I strongly support it. What it says is that gays and lesbians can't be fired from their job because they are gay or lesbian and it would be a federal law preventing them. I wonder if that, it's been blocked by the opponents in the majority in the Congress, I wonder if the Governor would lend a support to that law. question coming round here. Well it's logical. Well, I have no idea, I mean you can throw all kind. I don't know the particulars of this law. I will tell you, I'm the kind of person, I don't hire or fire somebody based upon their sex orientation. As a matter of fact, I would like to take the issue a little further. I don't really think it's any of my concerns about how you conduct your sex life and I think it's a private matter and I think that's the way it ought to be. But I am going to be respectful for people. I will tolerate people, and I support equal rights, but not special rights for people. And special rights, how does that effect gays and lesbians? Well, if they're given special protector status and that doesn't mean we shouldn't fully enforce laws and fully protect people and fully honor people, which I would do as the President of the United States. New subject, new question, Vice President Gore. How do you see the connection between controlling gun sales in this country and the incidents of death by accidental or intentional use of guns? Jim, I hope that we can come back to the subject of education, because the Governor made an extensive statement on it and I have a very different view than the one he expressed, but that having being been said, I believe that, well first of all, let me say that the Governor and I agree on somethings where this subject is concerned. I will not do anything to affect the rights of hunters or sportsmen. I think that homeowners have to be respected and the right to have a gun if they wish to. The problem, I see is that there are too many guns getting into the hands of children and criminals and people who for whatever reason are, some kind of history of stalking or domestic abuse really should not be able to get guns. I think these assault weapons are a problem. So, I favor closing the gun show loophole. In fact, I cast the tie-breaking vote to close it, but then the majority in the House representatives went the other way, that's still pending. If we could get agreement on that, may be they could pass that in the final days of this Congress. I think we ought to restore the three-day waiting period under the Brady law. I think we should toughen the enforcement of Gun laws so that the ones that are already on the books can be enforced much more effectively. Some of the restrictions that have been placed by the Congress in the last couple of years, I think in the last few years, I think have been unfortunate. I think that we ought to make all schools gun free, have a gun free zone around every school in this country. I think that measures like these are important, child safety trigger locks on a mandatory basis and others. Governor? Well, it starts with enforcing law and when you say law in clearing somebody if you are going to carry a gun illegally, we are going to arrest you. If you are going to sell a gun illegally, you need to be arrested, and if you commit a crime with a gun, there needs to be absolute certainty in the law and that means the local law enforcement officials need help at the federal level, the program like Project Exile, where the federal government intensifies arresting people who illegally use guns and we haven't done a very good job of that at the federal recently and I'm going to make it a priority. Secondly, I don't think we ought to be selling guns to people who shouldn't have them, as well as support instant background checks at gun shows. One of the reasons we have an instant background check is so that we instantly know whether or not somebody should have gun or not. In Texas, I tried to do something innovatively which is that, you know there is lot of talk about triggers locks being on guns sold in the future, I support that. But, I said, let's review, if you want a trigger locked to make your gun safe, come and get one for free and so we are distributing in our state of Texas for free. I think we ought to raise the age at which youth and all could carry a hand gun from 18 to 21. I disagree with the Vice-President on this issue. I don't feel need for registration of guns. I think the only people who are going to show up to register and get a license, I guess licensing, like a driver's license of a gun, the only people who are going to show up are law abiding citizens. The criminals are not going to show up and say, hey you mean my ID card, it's the law abiding citizens who will do that and I don't think that's going to be an effective tool to make the - keep our society safe. Right so, on guns. Somebody wants to cast a vote, based on your differences, where the differences? Well, I'm not for registration. I am for licensing by states of new handgun purchases. What does that mean? A photo license ID like a driver's license for new hand guns and you know, the Los Angeles was. Excuse me, you would have to get the license a photo ID to go in and before you could buy the gun. Correct. All right. Who would issue that? The state, I think states should do that for new handguns. Because too many criminals are getting guns. There was a recent investigation of the number in Texas who were given concealed weapons permits in spite of the fact that they had records and Los Angeles Times has spent a lot of ink going into that. But, I am not for doing anything that would affect hunters or sportsmen, rifles, shot guns, existing handguns. I do think that sensible gun safety measures are warranted now. Look, this is in the aftermath of column buying and peduca and all of the places around our country where the nation has been shocked by these weapons in the hands of the wrong people. The women who bought the guns for the two boys, who did that killing at Columbine, said that if she had had to give her name and fill out a form there, she would not have bought those guns. That conceivably could have prevented that tragedy. Back to the question about the differences on gun control. What are they, Governor, from your point view, between you and the Vice-President. Well, I'm not for photo licensing, but let me say something about Columbine. All right. This is VOA News Now from Washington with live coverage of the US.

President Clinton began lifting trade and economic sanctions against Yugoslavia on Thursday in a gesture of support for the newly elected regime in Belgrade. ``The victory of freedom in Serbia is one of the most hopeful developments in Europe since the fall of the Berlin Wall,'' the president said. ``It ended a dictatorship and it can liberate an entire region from the nagging fear that ethnic differences can again be exploited to start wars and shift borders.'' Clinton said he had directed the immediate lifting of an oil embargo and a flight ban to Yugoslavia, part of a package of sanctions imposed in 1998. ``The removal of these sanctions is a first step to ending Sebia's isolation,'' Clinton said in a written statement. Clinton acted just days after the European Union lifted an oil embargo and a ban, which had already been suspended, on commercial flights to and from Serbia, the main Yugoslav republic. The EU did not remove sanctions that froze overseas assets of former President Slobodan Milosevic and his allies and prohibited them from traveling to 15 EU nations. Clinton said his actions would not affect U.S. sanctions targeted against members of the former regime. Announcing the easing of penalties, Clinton said the United States has ``a strong interest in supporting Yugoslavia's newly-elected leaders as they work to build a truly democratic society.'' Clinton's adviser on the Balkans, James O'Brien, was meeting Thursday in Belgrade with new Yugoslav President Vojislav Kostunica to congratulate his country for its steps toward democratic rule and reinforce the message that the country must make more progress in order to be completely free of sanctions.

Announcing the easing of penalties, Clinton said the United States has ``a strong interest in supporting Yugoslavia's newly-elected leaders as they work to build a truly democratic society.'' Clinton's adviser on the Balkans, James O'Brien, was meeting Thursday in Belgrade with new Yugoslav President Vojislav Kostunica to congratulate his country for its steps toward democratic rule and reinforce the message that the country must make more progress in order to be completely free of sanctions. ``Our disagreement was with the Milosevic regime, not the people of Serbia who have suffered under the regime's brutal policies,'' the president said. He said the United States would ensure that the lifting of sanctions does not allow Milosevic's supporters ``to continue the systematic theft of resources that have marked the last 13 years.'' ``In that vein we will continue to enforce a ban on travel to the United States by top members of the Milosevic regime and keep in place measures that help the new government deter a looting of the national patrimony during the current period of transition in Yugoslavia,'' the president said. He said the administration also would review restrictions on Serbia's participation in international financial institutions ``as Serbia makes its democratic transition and meets its international obligations.'' Clinton said, ``There is still much work ahead for the Yugoslav people and their new government: restoring confidence in the rule of law, rebuilding an honest economy, accounting for the past while building for a better future. Thankfully, that work can now begin _ without the burden of isolation and with the friendship of the American people.''

President Clinton began lifting trade and economic sanctions against Yugoslavia on Thursday in a gesture of support for the newly elected regime in Belgrade. ``The victory of freedom in Serbia is one of the most hopeful developments in Europe since the fall of the Berlin Wall,'' the president said. ``It ended a dictatorship and it can liberate an entire region from the nagging fear that ethnic differences can again be exploited to start wars and shift borders.'' Clinton said he had directed the immediate lifting of an oil embargo and a flight ban to Yugoslavia, part of a package of sanctions imposed in 1998. ``The removal of these sanctions is a first step to ending Serbia's isolation,'' Clinton said in a written statement. Clinton acted just days after the European Union lifted an oil embargo and a ban, which had already been suspended, on commercial flights to and from Serbia, the main Yugoslav republic. The EU did not remove sanctions that froze overseas assets of former President Slobodan Milosevic and his allies and prohibited them from traveling to 15 EU nations.

The vice president of the Philippines resigned Thursday from her cabinet post as pressure mounted for President Joseph Estrada to step down in a growing bribery scandal. Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, who is not a member of the president's party, said she would stay on as vice president but was resigning as secretary of social welfare because of what she called ``serious accusations'' against Estrada. The president denied the accusations Thursday and said he would not step down despite a move in parliament to impeach him and despite a call on Wednesday for his resignation by the influential Roman Catholic Cardinal Jaime Sin. The accusations and the outcry are the most serious crisis of Estrada's two and a half year tenure. The mounting pressure against him is fueled by months of discontent with his presidency. In the current scandal, Estrada has been accused by a provincial governor who is also a gambling kingpin, of receiving more than $11 million in payoffs, most of it from an illegal numbers game called jueteng. The governor, Luis Singson, provided a Senate hearing with documents he said he had kept detailing payments he had made to Estrada, two of the president's sons and several government officials. It is the latest and most serious of several allegations of corruption against Estrada, which have heightened public dissatisfaction with his presidency. The president's standing has been hurt most seriously by accusations that he has mishandled the faltering economy. A point of pride under his predecessor, Fidel V. Ramos, it has declined steeply during his tenure and is now one of the weakest in the region. The already slack peso and stock exchange slid further Thursday as the attacks on Estrada grew. Before the central bank stepped in to halt its drop, the peso, the local currency, fell to a new low of 48.5 to the dollar. Analysts said the current scandal would only reinforce negative perceptions by investors that Estrada's government is incompetent, corrupt and riddled with cronyism. Estrada is also accused, both because of his policies and lack of policies, of aggravating a Moslem insurgency that has flared during his tenure in the southern Philippines. Critics also say he has bungled a mass hostage taking in the same region that has continued for almost five months. In a radio broadcast Thursday _ his first public statement since the bribery scandal erupted last week _ Estrada insisted that he had not received ``a single cent'' in illegal money and called the accusations ``a politically motivated hatchet job.'' In announcing her resignation, Arroyo said that because of the allegations against the president, ``I regret that I can no longer continue to serve as a member of the present cabinet.'' Arroyo is a popular politician who already is the leading candidate to succeed Estrada when his single six-year term ends, and she appeared to be moving firmly into the opposition with her resignation from the cabinet Thursday. Arroyo, who would take over as president if Estrada resigns or is forced from office, has resisted pressure from her allies in the past to speak out against Estrada. Sin, however, has long been a critic of the president. A moral force particularly because of his crucial role in the ``people power'' revolt that ousted former President Ferdinand Marcos in 1986, the cardinal sharpened his language on Wednesday. ``He has lost the moral ascendancy to govern,'' the cardinal said of Estrada. ``For the good of the people he should relinquish his office.'' Singson, who leveled the accusations against Estrada, has been one of his cronies and a participant in the president's late-night happy hours. In Senate testimony on Wednesday, Singson said he had personally managed the payments of $8.6 million in illegal gambling payoffs to Estrada over a 21-month period. In addition, he said, the president had received $2.8 million siphoned from the tax returns of his province, Ilocos Sur. Singson said he was speaking now because the president had cut him out of provincial revenues from a new legal form of gambling called Bingo 2-Ball. Jueteng is a huge illegal business in the Philippines controlled by warlords who live in fortified castles. Singson said that when Bingo 2-Ball was instituted last month, ostensibly to put illegal jueteng out of business, Estrada had awarded the franchise to a rival crony, a prominent gambler named Charlie Ang. Estrada suspended Bingo 2-Ball on Sunday after Singson made his allegations.

President Vojislav Kostunica met Thursday with a senior U.S. envoy _ the first high-level contact between the two governments since Belgrade broke relations with the United States last year on the eve of the NATO bombing campaign. The meeting between Kostunica and Balkan envoy James C. O'Brien followed welcome news from Washington for the moribund Yugoslav economy. President Clinton announced Thursday he was lifting an oil embargo and a flight ban on Yugoslavia imposed in 1998 after former President Slobodan Milosevic launched a crackdown on Kosovo Albanians. ``The victory of freedom in Serbia is one of the most hopeful developments in Europe since the fall of the Berlin Wall,'' Clinton said. ``It ended a dictatorship and it can liberate an entire region from the nagging fear that ethnic differences can again be exploited to start wars and shift borders.'' Kostunica also met with Italian Premier Giuliano Amato, the first head of government to travel to Belgrade since Kostunica took office Saturday. ``The factors that distanced Yugoslavia from a democratic society are now gone ... This enables us to work as friends on the task of reintegrating Yugoslavia into international institutions,'' Amato said after the meeting. Even as Kostunica reached out to the West, he kept a close eye on political developments within Yugoslavia, where Milosevic supporters tried to stem the steady erosion of their power. Milosevic's Socialist Party said its hard-line secretary-general, Gorica Gajevic, had been replaced by the more moderate Zoran Andjelkovic, head of the Serb-run Kosovo government. Serbian President Milan Milutinovic was named the party's vice president. Milosevic apparently remained at the helm despite losing the presidency, and the Socialists also called a party congress for Nov. 25. Later Thursday, Beta news agency quoted Socialist official Miloje Mihajlovic as saying Milosevic would resign and that further changes in the party were ``necessary.'' There were also signs of a rift between the Socialists and their neo-communist allies, the Yugoslav Left, the party of Milosevic's influential wife Mirjana Markovic. Both parties said unlike in last month's elections, their candidates would run independently in the next Serbian vote. The shake-up could mean Milosevic is trying to regroup and consolidate his followers so he can remain a political player. Prominent analyst Bratislav Grubacic, however, suggested Milutinovic might be trying to take over Milosevic's party by sacking its staunchest hard-liners. ``The final showdown with Milosevic will be at the party congress,'' Grubacic said. Allies of the current and ousted president are locked in a power struggle as Kostunica seeks to dismantle the last vestiges of Milosevic's authoritarian regime and open ties to the West, which will be a key factor in revitalizing the moribund Yugoslav economy. The lifting of the oil embargo will help relieve terrible shortages of fuel, said Leo Drollas, chief economist at the Center for Global Energy Studies in London. The head of Croatia's Adriatic oil pipeline operator, JANAF, Ante Cicin Sain, said the company could begin supplying oil to Yugoslav refineries soon. In addition to economic support, the West also moved to provide Kostunica with a political boost. ``We also talked about relations between our two countries and I think our open and warm discussions of the issues that have intruded on our relationship set a good tone,'' O'Brien said after meeting Kostunica. ``We hope our relations will normalize.. it's now different,'' Kostunica said. But Kostunica still faces a host of domestic political obstacles to full consolidation of his power. Kostunica's camp has set a Friday deadline for Milosevic's loyalists to agree to form a transitional government in Serbia and call early elections in December. Serbia is Yugoslavia's dominant republic and Milosevic's allies still hold a majority in the republic's parliament. The deadline was set after attempts by Milosevic officials to reclaim control of the 100,000-strong Serbian police and government posts the ousted president's followers still hold.

An apparent suicide terrorist bombing tore into a U.S. Navy destroyer Thursday, killing four Americans, injuring three dozen and leaving 12 missing, the Defense Department said. Authorities said the explosion was triggered by a small boat that had pulled alongside the ship as it was docked in the Arabian Peninsula. President Clinton said the attack on the USS Cole appeared to be an act of terrorism. ``We will find out who was responsible and hold them accountable,'' he pledged. No one has claimed responsibility for the attack, U.S. officials said. Calling the attack a ``despicable and cowardly act,'' Clinton told reporters at the White House that he had ordered all Navy ships in the region to pull out of port as a safety precaution and a heightened state of alert at U.S. military bases. He had a message for those responsible for the attack: ``If their intention was to deter us from our mission of promoting peace and security in the Middle East, they will fail utterly.'' The president said he had dispatched investigators from the State Department, the Pentagon and the FBI to Yemen. He said Yemen had pledged its cooperation. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright talked earlier in the day with Ali Abdallah Saleh, the president of Yemen, who visited the injured in the hospital. The Cole, with a crew of about 350, was in port at Aden, Yemen, for refueling when a small craft came alongside and an explosion followed, according to Lt. Cmdr. Daren Pelkie, spokesman for the Navy's 5th Fleet headquarters in Manama, Bahrain. At a State Department news conference, Albright said this is no time for the United States to ``retreat from our responsibilities'' in the region. ``We are operating in a world that is filled with a variety of threats. But that doesn't mean that we can crawl into an ostrichlike mode. We are eagles,'' Albright said. Details of the incident were sketchy, but officials at the Pentagon said it appeared that the small boat was carrying some form of high explosive powerful enough to rip a large hole _ 20 feet by 40 feet _ in the side of the 505-foot long, 8,600-ton U.S. ship. The destroyer is built of steel and fortified with 70 tons of armor. The boat was of the kind used in normal harbor operations in the port of Aden, according to a Pentagon official familiar with official reports from the scene. The official, who discussed the matter on condition of anonymity, said the boat's crew had helped secure the Cole's mooring lines at the fueling dock before it came alongside the ship. As a result, officials said, its presence near the Cole did not raise suspicions. Two men were seen standing in the small boat before the explosion, the official said. He said there was no doubt the explosion came from the small boat but it was not clear whether the boat rammed the ship. Sen. John Warner, R-Va., chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said the attacking craft was not ``put together in a garage overnight. There had to be careful planning.'' He said female sailors were among the casualties. It appeared to be the first attack against a U.S. Navy ship since 1991, when the USS LaSalle, a 14,650-ton command ship, was fired on with automatic weapons from two unidentified craft while deployed in the Persian Gulf. Pelkie said at least 36 sailors were reported injured in the attack Thursday and 12 were missing, in addition to four confirmed dead. The injured were taken to a local hospital and U.S. Navy medical teams were dispatched to the scene from Bahrain. Flooding on the ship was reported to be contained and there were no reports of fire. The explosion ``was so loud I thought it was from inside the hotel. The windows in 21 of our 33 rooms were shattered, and many of the television sets fell and broke,'' said Ahmed Mohammed Al-Naderi, manager of the port-side Rock Hotel. ``Thank God, none of the guests or hotel personnel were injured.'' Al-Naderi said he could see the Cole from his hotel. ``It has a big hole in it. ... There are some people on board, and some small boats around it.'' Clinton was notified of the incident by his national security adviser, Sandy Berger, said White House spokesman Jake Siewert. The president called Defense Secretary William Cohen, urging him and Berger to find out what happened. At the Justice Department, Attorney General Janet Reno declined to comment on a possible terrorist link. She said FBI agents in the region have been sent to the scene and that the bureau was putting together investigators, explosives experts and an evidence response team to send as well. The nearest FBI legal attaches are stationed in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Almost all the agents assigned to go to Yemen have been to the Middle East before to investigate one or both of two previous terrorist attacks: the 1996 truck bomb attack that killed 19 U.S. airmen at the Khobar Towers apartments in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, and the 1998 bombings of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, that killed 224 people including 12 Americans. Asked if consideration is being given to a worldwide terrorist alert at U.S. installations, she said, ``That is an issue that is being addressed.'' Because the Cole had just arrived in Aden and was due to remain there only for four hours to take on fuel, U.S. officials said they believed the boat's mission was a planned act of terrorism. The ship had passed through the Suez Canal on Monday and sailed down the Red Sea before arriving in Aden on the Gulf of Aden, Pelkie said. U.S. Navy ships commonly stop in Aden for refueling. The region has been swept in recent days by demonstrations, some of them violent and often with an anti-U.S. tone, sparked by Israeli-Palestinian clashes in Israel and the Palestinian territories. Pro-Palestinian rallies have been held daily in Yemen. William Arkin, a military expert who specializes in Gulf affairs, said Yemen became a more frequent refueling stop for Navy ships following a December 1997 U.S. government policy decision to open up contacts and cooperation with the country. At about 12:15 p.m. local time, or 5:15 a.m. EDT, a U.S. Army major who works at the U.S. Embassy in Aden saw a small rubber boat of unknown nationality ram the destroyer's port side, Pelkie said. Flooding aboard the Cole was contained and no fires were reported, the spokesman said. The ship was listing four degrees to its port side after the explosion. The Cole is a ship of the Burke destroyer class and carries sophisticated Aegis weaponry. Its home port is Norfolk, Va. It was en route to the Persian Gulf. The destroyer was commissioned in June 1996 and is named after Marine Sgt. Darrell Cole, who was awarded the Medal of Honor for heroism during the battle of Iwo Jima in 1945. ___ On the Net: USS Cole is at http://www.spear.navy.mil/ships/ddg67/ NO PICKUP

yemen has been a dangerous place for a long time, but the boldness and destructiveness of this attack stunned almost everyone. who could be responsible? nbc's andrea mitchell tonight on the terrorist watch. tonight, the question for u.s. terrorist hunters -- who could have pulled off such a well-timed attack? intelligence officials tell nbc news this may be an inside job, planned for six months or longer, with informers from yemen's government or the port alerting terrorists to the "cole's" refueling schedule. if, as it now appears, this was an act of terrorism, it was a despicable and cowardly act. we will find out who was responsible and hold them accountable. but how to find the terrorists? investigators on the scene already look for clues. we're conducting a joint forensic investigation of the explosion, as we do in all these cases, in a very detailed, methodical and professional manner. and we should have concrete results shortly. officials say no specific warning of today's bombing, but a few days ago, intelligence that something might happen in yemen -- officials say, a dangerous country, until ten years ago, on the u.s. list of terrorist nations. but this year, its president visits the white house. still, terror groups roam freely there. no one knows. first, osama bin laden, based in afghanistan, but with family roots in yemen, sent terrorist trainers there. but officials say no evidence yet he is involved. second, egyptian islamic jihad assassinated anwar sadat in 1981, killed tourists in egypt in 1997 -- loosely aligned with bin laden, but officials say could operate on its own. or u.s. officials suspect hezbollah -- blew up the marine barracks in lebanon in 1983, only last week kidnapped three israeli soldiers in lebanon. or hamas, responsible for suicide bombings in israel. and possibly the palestine islamic jihad, also with a cell in yemen. certainly it's an attack that requires some planning. it's not something that was laid on overnight. what is the motive? experts say it could be triggered by anger at the u.s. over recent violence in the middle east. if the suspects are identified, what would the u.s. do next? i would certainly hope that we would retaliate if we have good intelligence as to where it came from. last time there was a terror attack against the u.s. -- the embassy bombings in africa two years ago -- the president did retaliate, on what critics called sketchy evidence. still, officials say if there is any way to track the culprits, he will do the same thing again. andrea mitchell, nbc news, washington.

This is The World. I am Tony Kahn. Novelist and playwright Gao Xingjian today became the first Chinese language author to win the Nobel Prize for Literature. Gao Xingjian's avant-garde plays made him persona non-grata in his native China and he fled the country in 1988. He settled in France becoming a French citizen two years ago. Gregory Lee is a professor of Chinese and Chinese literature at the University of Lyons in France. Professor Lee, I gather you know the man and know his work. Tell us a little bit about him, who is he and why did he flee China. Gao Xingjian is quite an interesting writer because in some senses he differs from the great cohort of contemporary Chinese writers that are well known in the west today. I would say that the great difference about Gao Xingjian is that he actually received a university education. He was educated in French, so has a very good knowledge of French literature and it is very much French literature that has influenced his own literary creativities, only free production, so much so that conservative Chinese critics would accuse him of blind worship of western models. Sartre is a big man in Mr. Shing Chen's life, isn't he? I would say so that Sartre has been a quite a big influence. I think the other influences would be Samuel Beckett, the Irish and French language writer, UNESCO, these are models and, of course, all of these writers are writers who were active in the first half of the twentieth century. Well, this is very interesting because Mr. Gao left China before Tianenmen. He wrote a play, in particular about the events there. Would you say that his influences may be more French literary then they were his own immediate life experience? I would say both, in fact, because the first play that he wrote that made him famous was a play that dates from 1981, which was actually called 'Bus Stop', which many people said was based on the play or had resonances from Beckett's play 'Waiting for Godo' and it concerned a number of Chinese people from different walks of like who were standing at a bus stop waiting for a bus that never came. So, we can see immediately that the resonances with the play of Beckett. But Gao Xingjian really before 1989 felt that he was restricted, that he was unable to write and to have his plays produced, as he would wish, and so left China couple of years before the incident at Tiananmen in 1989. I think it is a great day for modern Chinese literature and it is a day that has been awaited for the past 60 to 70 years. Gregory Lee is a professor of Chinese and Chinese literature at the University of Lyons, France. He spoke to us from his home in Provence. Professor, thank you very much for speaking with us. No at all. Thank you very much.

At least six American sailors on board a US navy destroyer in the Yemeni port of Aden have been killed. Eleven others are missing, and 35 were injured after an explosion. President Clinton says the US will act if the explosion was the result of an attack. If, as it now appears, this was an act of terrorism, it was a despicable and cowardly act. We will find out who is responsible and hold them accountable. If their intention was to deter us from our mission of promoting peace and security in the Middle East, they will fail utterly. Earlier the Pentagon withdrew an initial report that an inflatable raft packed with explosives had rammed the USS Cole but it says a small raft was nearby. Reports from the scene say two men onboard the raft stood at attention just before the explosion.

This is The World, a co-production of the BBC World Service, PRI and WBGH, in Boston. I am Tony Kahn. For the first time since the US-led NATO air war against Yugoslavia last year, there were high level discussions between the two countries, and the talks were cordial. The Special US envoy to the Balkans, James O'Brien met with Yugoslavia's new President Vojislav Kostunica in Belgrade. Kostunica has been President for less than a week and he is eager to improve relations with his countries many former enemies. Kostunica's meeting today with O'Bryan seemed to represent a move in the right direction. The World's Jennifer Glass reports from the Yugoslav capital. Both men seemed pleased with the first diplomatic contact between the United States and Yugoslavia in over a year. The Balkan nation's new President said the meeting covered a range of issues. This was a conversation about many questions that concern both nations, both states. There was a gap in this communications. After this meeting we hope that we will bridge that gap and that our relations will normalize. As part of that attempt to go closer the United States is lifting some of its sanctions against Yugoslavia, the same ones the European Union lifted on Monday on oil and international flights. Over the next few weeks, economic restrictions on other industries are to be lifted but until the fate of former President Slobodan Milosevic is discussed the US plans to keep in place restrictions that prevent Yugoslavia from receiving money from the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. For now Kostunica's biggest challenge is dealing with Milosevic allies in the Serbian parliament and in government ministries. They are trying to bring Kostunica's supporters from taking control of the police force and purging top officials from the army. That too was discussed, said the US envoy James O'Brien. The President and I had a far-ranging discussion. He told me about political developments in Yugoslavia and expressed his confidence that the democratic transition will be consolidated and moved forward with new elections, so that we are able to see democracy take root in all the institutions in the Republics and in the Federal Government. It will not be an easy task. Although the Serbian parliament has agreed to early elections in December, the current parliament is full of Milosevic supporters. Kostunica sought reassurance that two agreements made under the Milosevic government would be honored, the deals that ended the wars in Bosnia and Kosovo. We are very much concerned about two documents that should be respected and we agreed about that, one of them is , another is, of course, Resolution 1244. We agreed to reaffirm our commitments to Resolution 1244 in Kosovo, so that there will be self-government there, and so that all people who want to live in Kosovo are able to do so under a democratic government. UN Resolution 1244 marked the end of the Kosovo conflict and provides for the return of some Yugoslav forces to Kosovo, something many Serbs would like to see and Kosovo's ethnic Albanian majority strongly object to. The presence of Yugoslav troops in Kosovo would boost Kostunica's standing among many who see the province as the center of their religion and from which thousands of Serbs have been forced to flee. Their presence could also make life difficult for NATO troops in Kosovo. Even before today's meeting Kostunica had made it clear that while US-Yugoslav relations are valuable, more important are his country's dealings with Europe. Also meeting with him in Belgrade today were the Italian Prime Minister and foreign minister, and a current and former high representative for Bosnia. US officials here say they are eager to reopen the American embassy but would not offer a time frame. Kostunitsza's challenge now is striking a balance between pleasing nationalist Serbs who support him and rebuilding ties with the west. For The World, I am Jennifer Glass in Belgrade.

I'm David Coller, VOA News. At least six US sailors were killed and more than 30 wounded, Thursday in an apparent suicide attack on a US warship in Yemen. VOA's Alex Belida reports from the Pentagon. The crew of destroyer USS Cole had no reason to expect trouble when the ship pulled into Aden harbor for a brief routine refueling stop. The crew, especially saw nothing to fear from a small support boat, sent out by harbor authorities to assist in the mooring process. But that small boat was apparently loaded with explosives and manned by suicide bombers. As it pulled up to the US destroyer, it blew up, tearing a gaping hole in the Cole's side. Admiral Vern Clark, the Chief of Naval operations, says there had been no threats or warnings ahead of the port call. He says other recently refueling visits by US ships to Aden had gone off without incident. Because of general concerns about security in the Mid East, armed guards had been posted on the ship's deck. Other standard safety and security measures were also being observed. Alex Belida, VOA News, the Pentagon.

Right now let's get an update on the latest world news from VOA's Dave Deforest. Well Dick, US officials have launched an investigation into a suspected terrorist attack that killed at least six sailors on a US warship in Yemen. They say a suicide boat exploded near the USS Cole destroyer as it refueled early Thursday in the Yemeni port of Aden. The blast tore a huge gap in the ship's side. At least 10 other crewmembers are missing more than 30 were injured. Defense Secretary William Cohen says if a formal investigation shows it was a terrorist attack. Dispatch investigators to learn what was responsible for the blast, tragedies that test our strength and our resolve occur and have occurred in the past. We have passed the test and measuring up to those responsibilities and we will pass that test once again today. Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Vern Clark says the bombers were aboard a small boat that was assisting in the refueling of the destroyer at the port. No one has claimed responsibility. US military forces around the world have been placed on high alert.

This is VOA News Now, from Washington, I'm Victor Moralis along with David Chadwick. The United States eased some of its sanctions against Yugoslavia Thursday. The new President Vojislav Kostunica also received a boost when the International Monetary Fund said Yugoslavia could rejoin the world organization in just a few months. Allies of ousted leader Slobodan Milosevic continue to struggle with members of the democratic opposition of Serbia for control of Yugoslavia's transitional government. And in Serbia's sister republic of Montenegro where most citizens boycotted the September 24th elections in support of Montenegrin President Milo Djukanovic, popular sentiment for independence from Serbia remains strong. On today's Dateline Judith Latham explores the question of Montenegro at the crossroads. According to Balkan analyst, the future of Montenegro within the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia remains unclear. Greg Sholty, Senior Director for South East European Affairs at the National Security Council in Washington says he believes the toppling of the Milosevic government, which brought Mr. Kostunica to power will ultimately benefit, not only the people of Serbia, but also the people throughout the region. I think this change can only bring greater stability to the region. He has already reached out to Montenegro and talked about looking again at the constitutional arrangements between those two countries. As you know, we never supported the aspirations for independence or any type of referendum towards independence. We always thought Montenegro should remain part of what we hoped would be a democratic FRY and it looks like in a way that vision is coming true now and that both the government of Montenegro and the new government in Belgrade is prepared to talk about that relationship and resolve it peacefully as opposed to Belgrade using threats. On Sunday President Clinton called up, had a good conversation with President Kostunica and the President told the new President that we shared his vision of a Yugoslavia at peace, working for the betterment of all people and that we would be joining the Europeans in lifting sanctions and that we also hope to restore diplomatic relations soon. Greg Sholty, staff member of the National Security Council is accompanying President Clinton's Chief Advisor to the Balkans, James O'Brien to the region. He spoke with us just prior to his departure. Jim Hooper directs Balkan policy at the Washington office of the International Crises Group which is headquartered in Brussels. Mr. Hooper says the current relationship between Montenegro and Serbia is complicated because the Socialist Peoples party of Montenegro, which was allied with Mr. Milosevic's Socialist Party of Serbia elected its own deputies to the Yugoslav parliament. According to Mr. Hooper, about a quarter of the people of Montenegro are still pro-Belgrade and do not support the policies of Montenegro's independent-minded President Milo Djukanovic. They will presumably continue to be interested in a federal relationship with Yugoslavia, but Montenegro now has to think through its new relationship with a democratic Serbia. But one of the problems is that I think Montenegro is only prepared to accept a relationship with Serbia on the basis of a full and equal partnership. I don't think even this new democratic government is going to want to give Montenegro a full partnership in the federation. Mr. Kostunica's first decision after his inauguration on Saturday was to announce a lifting of the Serbian economic blockade on Montenegro. How significant is that? I think that was a very positive step by Serbia to remove the economic embargo on Montenegro. Mr. Chikanovic and Mr. Kostunica were supposed to meet on Wednesday to discuss their relationship, but Mr. Chikanovic was in a car crash and I think Mr. Chikanovic needs to assure himself and the Montenegran people that the Serbian military in Montenegro is no longer a threat to Montenegro's reformist and democratizing government. During Mr. Kostunica's presidential campaign, he said that he favored drawing up a new constitution that would make Montenegro feel more of an equal partner with Serbia and then in a recent news conference, he proposed that a Montenegrin become Prime Minister in his new government. Would that make a tremendous difference? The difficulty is going to be first in carrying out the appointment of Montenegrin Prime Minister at the federal level. Mr. Kostunica cannot make all of these decisions himself, and after all there are 18 democratic parties in the democratic opposition of Serbia coalition. If they give it to Mr. Hedra Belonovic, who is a member of the SNP party, which is pro-Belgrade, he does not reflect the views of the Yuganovic government. Mr. Kostunica believes that perhaps this needs to be done, Mr. Yuganovic did not run any candidates from his coalition in the federal elections. He regarded the elections as illegal. So all of this remains to be worked out. Jim Hooper, Director of Balkan policy at the Washington office, of the International Crisis Group. Stroyan Serevic, a columnist with the Belgrade independent weekly, Breame, who is currently a Fellow at the US Institute of Peace in Washington is a Montenegran by birth. Mr. Serevic says the results of the recent elections in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, have reversed the direction Montenegro had been pursuing under President Yuganovic. This federation was almost nonexistent. Montenegro was at the edge of becoming fully independent. Then now, with this revolution in Serbia, with the new government, this situation is going to be apparently very different. They have to reconsider their previous policy and to establish better relations with the new regime in Serbia. I'm convinced that the separatist arguments in Montenegro are going to lose some strength. Now, without Milosevic, it seems that Montenegrin government is in a kind of complicated position. Montenegrin government boycotted elections, which managed to drive Milosevic out of power. So, Montenegro basically did not help Serbia reposition. There is a kind of mistrust on both sides now. The Montenegrin position, which was pro-Milosevic called Socialist Peoples Party, they did take part in the elections and they are, may be, going to form a new government with a new democratic Serbia. I think it's very confusing for a moment. What we need is good will on both sides. Mr. Serevic says the new Yugoslav government in Belgrade has frequently mentioned offering the position of Federal Prime Minister to a Montenegrin. But then Montenegro is hesitant now to accept this offer because Yuganovic and his people, they are still reluctant to give up completely the idea of full independence, but then, it seems there won't be any international support for that. So, I think that they will be forced to give up this idea and to cooperate better with Belgrade. So Montenegro is now in the kind of awkward situation of not recognizing the government and the President who is now recognized by the rest of the world. And in a future Yugoslav federation, Stoyan Serevic says, Montenegro would likely be at a disadvantage. Montenegro is almost 20 times smaller than Serbia in terms of population. So, it's absolutely unimaginable how you can create any sort of federation when one party is so much smaller. The problem is how to find the formula to represent these two parts from the federal level. You know, if I were President of Montenegro, I think I would ask, you know, 50% of everything, but then if I were a President of Serbia, I will say okay, I will offer you Montenegrins 20% of everything and it would be very generous. You know, it's just impossible to find a good representation of these two parts and I think that the good initial position for negotiations over, you know, decisions would be this platform proposed by Montenegrin government two years ago, which looks like some sort of confederal contract between two sides that are virtually independent. Both sides will probably be trying to find some unorthodox solution. Bremae columnist, Stroyan Serevic says he believes a win-win solution is possible if politicians in Serbia and Montenegro are creative and have sufficient good will to devise a compromise that both sides can accept. 'Montenegro at the Crossroads' was the subject of today's Dateline. I'm Judith Latham.

A U.S. Navy destroyer refueling in Yemen was rocked by an enormous explosion Thursday, and President Clinton said it appeared to be a terror attack. At least six American sailors died and 11 others were missing and presumed dead, officials said. Nearly three dozen others were injured, some of them severely. The explosion, which occurred at 12:15 p.m. (5:15 a.m. eastern time), came from one of several smaller harbor boats helping the destroyer, the Cole, dock at a refueling station in the Yemeni port at Aden, on the southern tip of the Arabian peninsula. Senior Pentagon officials said the boat, with at least two men aboard, had been loaded with explosives in what was evidently a well-planned suicide attack. Clinton, already grappling with escalating violence in Israel, appeared in the Rose Garden at the White House Thursday afternoon and somberly vowed to determine who was responsible and hold them accountable. His remarks raised the possibility of American military retaliation. ``If, as it now appears, this was an act of terrorism, it was a despicable and cowardly act,'' Clinton said, only moments after having met with his senior national security advisers. Officials said the explosion tore a gaping hole, 20 feet by 40 feet, in the side of the Cole, a guided-missile destroyer based in Norfolk, Va., which was carrying a crew of about 300. The blast caused extensive flooding, causing the ship to list slightly. By nightfall, however, crew members had managed to control the flooding and keep the ship afloat. The blast was devastatingly powerful. Adm. Vern Clark, the chief of naval operations, said that the Cole's hull at the point of the blast was designed to withstand 51,000 pounds of pressure per square inch. Photographs of the Cole showing a charred, bent hole at the waterline. The officials said they would not know the exact type of explosive used until forensic experts arrive and take samples from the ship's hull. The attack on the Cole occurred in an impoverished country on the Arabian peninsula that the United States has been trying to engage diplomatically, despite its history as a haven for terrorist groups, in part with port calls like the Cole's. American ships have stopped in Aden a dozen times since last year, officials said. Clark said that efforts to improve ties with Yemen were ``at the heart of the motivation'' to use its refueling station. The Cole, on its way to the Persian Gulf to join a naval battle group involved in operations over Iraq, had just arrived in Aden when the blast occurred. It was only scheduled to stay about four hours, just long enough to refuel before resuming its journey. While Clinton and his senior aides stopped short of definitively attributing the explosion to terrorism, senior Pentagon officials said the Cole was attacked in a highly sophisticated operation that depended on access to information about the Cole's brief visit to Aden. They said the evidence indicated the attack may have been weeks or months in the planning, suggesting that it might not be directly related to the roiling tensions in the Middle East. ``It was clearly a pre-planned, premeditated event,'' one officer said. Clark, who appeared at the Pentagon with Secretary of Defense William Cohen, said he had little doubt the explosion was deliberate. ``I have no reason to think that this was anything but a senseless act of terrorism,'' he said. Attorney General Janet Reno announced that the Federal Bureau of Investigation had already dispatched a team of investigators to Yemen to lead an inquiry _ a clear sign the administration was treating the explosion as a criminal act. The first agents came from a bureau office in neighboring Saudi Arabia, while a larger group that included explosive experts was leaving from Washington, along with investigators from the State Department and the Pentagon. Cohen said no one had immediately claimed responsibility for attacking the Cole. He and others here in Washington warned against prematurely assigning blame to any group or speculating on the motives for an attack. (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) The list of potential suspects was long. Several radical Islamic organizations operate in Yemen, according to the State Department. They include the Palestinian group known as Hamas, the Palestinian Islamic Jihad, the Egyptian Islamic Jihad and cells linked to Osama bin Laden, the exiled Saudi whom American officials blamed for the bombings of U.S. Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania on Aug. 7, 1998. The United States retaliated for those bombings 13 days later with missile strikes in Afghanistan and Sudan. In recent weeks, President Saddam Hussein of Iraq has also intensified his threats against the United States, Israel and Arab states like Kuwait and Saudi Arabia in recent week. Even as the Cole was struck, U.S. intelligence officials had detected movement by one of Iraq's Republican Guard divisions west of the Iraqi capital, Baghdad, though Cohen suggested the timing could be coincidental. The explosion came at the height of the American presidential race. Along with the violence in Israel, it immediately eclipsed the campaign debate. Vice President Al Gore returned to Washington from the campaign trails to participate in meetings at the White House about both crises. His Republican rival, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, called for a vigorous, united approach on both fronts. ``Let's hope we can gather enough intelligence to figure out who did the act and take the necessary action,'' Bush said of the attack on the Cole. ``There must be a consequence.'' (END OPTIONAL TRIM) The attack was a jolt to an administration already scrambling to save the Middle East peace process, and its effects rippled around Washington and the world. President Clinton, who returned early to the White House from a visit to Chappaqua, N.Y., where he celebrated his 25th wedding anniversary, ordered all American ships in the Persian Gulf region to pull out of port and head to the relative safety of open waters. The Pentagon announced that it had heightened the state of alert for American forces around the world, including at American bases, while the State Department reiterated Thursday a world-wide advisory warning Americans living or traveling overseas to be watchful of potential terrorist attacks. The Cole, an Arleigh Burke-class destroyer, is one of the Navy's most sophisticated warships, equipped with advanced radar systems and high-speed missiles and cannons designed to protect itself and American battle groups against air and missile attacks. Despite its technological advances, however, the ship was essentially helpless to prevent an attack like the one Thursday _ the maritime equivalent of a truck packed with explosives pulling up to a building. ``This is precisely the kind of threats that we face where countries are unwilling to take us on head to head, but will resort to acts of terrorism in order to achieve their goal,'' Cohen said at the Pentagon. The Cole's crew was already on a heightened state of alert because of the threat of terrorism in the region generally, but the boat that exploded did not raise suspicions since it was part of a flotilla helping the Cole moor at a refueling pier in the port. ``It has a legitimate purpose for being in the area,'' the senior official said of the ship. According to Pentagon officials, an Army major who serves as deputy defense attache at the U.S. Embassy in Yemen and was observing the refueling operation reported that the boat had already tied up one of the Cole's mooring lines to the refueling station in the harbor. The officials said the boat then returned, evidently to retrieve another line, when it exploded. One Pentagon official said the two men in the boat appeared to stand moments before the blast, but Cohen and Clark declined to speculate on their actions before the blast or their motives. Both evidently died in the explosion, while their boat was destroyed. It was not clear if others were aboard. The Cole's vulnerability to an attack of this sort immediately raised questions about the security measures the ship had taken. Clark said that the ship's captain would not necessarily have expected a routine mooring operation to pose a threat. ``Let me just say that the ability to deal with this kind of attack is limited by this circumstance,'' Clark said. While the visit was scheduled to be brief, Navy officials had notified the government of Yemen several days in advance. While security personnel were on the Cole's deck at the time, a Pentagon official said the crew had no warning before the explosion, which had such force that it buckled the ship's decks, badly damaging the engine room amidships, as well as an adjoining mess and living quarters. Most of those killed were in those areas, the officials said. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said she had spoken with the President of Yemen, Ali Abdullah Saleh, who had offered to help with the treatment of those injured and the investigation. If confirmed as a terrorist attack, it would be the worst against American military forces since the bombing of an Air Force barracks in Saudi Arabia killed 19 airmen in 1996. It was the worst attack on an American Navy ship since an Iraqi missile struck the Stark, a guided-missile frigate in the Persian Gulf in 1987, killing 37 sailors. The Navy dispatched two other ships from the region to Yemen to help with the effort to secure and ultimately repair the Cole. They are expected to arrive on Friday. Cohen said British and French ships were also headed to Aden to help. The roughly three dozen injured by the explosion were being treated at a hospital in Aden but were expected to be evacuated soon to American military hospitals, possibly in Germany. A medical team was flying from the island nation of Bahrain, headquarters of the Navy's 5th Fleet in the Persian Gulf. (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) Television footage from Yemen showed injured sailors being treated in a hospital. Cohen and Clark said the Pentagon had asked American news networks to stop broadcasting the stark images for fear of upsetting family members who had not yet learned the fate of sailors aboard. Clark expressed gratitude that they had complied. ``I am so appreciative of the willingness of the networks to cease with those reports,'' he said. At the Cole's homeport in Norfolk, the Navy set up a center for family members to gather as grim news of deaths and injuries came in. (END OPTIONAL TRIM) Clinton said the explosion aboard the Cole would not scuttle U.S. diplomatic efforts in the Middle East, if indeed that was the motive for the attack. ``If their intention was to deter us from our mission of promoting peace and security in the Middle East, they will fail utterly,'' he said. At the Pentagon, Cohen echoed those remarks and warned that the United States would not rest ``until we have tracked down those who are responsible for this vicious and cowardly act.'' ``The United States is a global power with global responsibilities, and as a result, we face global risks,'' Cohen said. ``In the wake of this tragedy,'' he continued. ``I want to be very clear about one point. We will continue to protect our national interests around the world, in the Middle East, and elsewhere. No one should doubt our resolve to remain a force for peace and for stability, and no one should assume that they can force us to retreat. No one should assume they can attack us with impunity.''

Al Gore and George W. Bush both urged Palestinians to end the rising Middle East violence and demanded retribution for the apparent terrorist bombing of a Navy destroyer, finding rare agreement on foreign policy crises that overshadowed their presidential campaign. A day after their second debate, Gore and Bush scaled back plans to criticize each other's credibility, realizing that candidates _ like the commander in chief they hope to become _ must adapt to world events. ``It's time for our nation to speak with one voice,'' said Bush, the GOP nominee. Gore, the Democratic vice president, cut short a campaign trip to return to the White House, where he hadn't been since June because of the presidential race. ``They're learning what it means to be president of the United States because their plans and their campaigns just got wiped off the front pages,'' said Democratic political consultant Jim Duffy. ``And neither one of them better get caught playing politics with these issues.'' As the U.S. candidates slept, an angry mob of Palestinians killed three Israeli soldiers in the West Bank town of Ramallah. Israel's response was swift: Helicopters rocketed Arafat's residential compound in the Gaza Strip as well as targets in the West Bank. Separately, a small boat apparently carrying explosives tore a hole in the side of a Navy ship in port on the Arabian Peninsula, killing and wounding American sailors. Gore abruptly dropped plans to criticize Bush's debate performance _ ``I'm not going to take any political questions,'' he told reporters _ as aides said a full-throated attack would have been improper on such a day. He did criticize Bush's health care record as Texas governor, telling supporters it ``gives us an important window into what his priorities are.'' In one way, the turn of events worked against the vice president. After their first debate, Bush highlighted Gore's misstatements and undercut his credibility to gain in polls. Gore hoped to turn the tables Thursday by trumpeting Bush's miscues in their second meeting, particularly the misrepresentation of a case involving three convicted murderers in Texas. ``Mr. Bush ought to be held to the same exacting standards applied to Al Gore last week,'' deputy campaign manager Mark Fabiani said. Bush let his aides respond, knowing foreign affairs would overshadow the post-debate criticism. The Texas governor said he was saddened and angry by the attack on a Navy ship. ``Take the necessary action,'' he said. ``There must be a consequence.'' Gore said if the incident is an act of terrorism, ``something like this will be met with a full and forceful and effective retaliatory response from the United States of America. We will not leave this matter. We will defend our country.'' Bush campaigned in Pennsylvania and Michigan. Gore was in Wisconsin, and planned to visit Michigan Friday and Saturday. Their debate had found both men in agreement on several foreign policy issues, including the Middle East. Both called Israel a strong ally and urged Arafat to quell Palestinian unrest. On Thursday, Gore said, ``I want to call on Chairman Arafat to issue instructions to those who have been perpetrating the violence to cease and desist.'' Bush said Arafat ``must stand up and call on his people to put down their rocks and arms.'' Mike Young, political science professor at Penn State University, said Thursday's events would likely focus voters on foreign policy. ``I think that benefits Gore. I think it benefits the incumbent, the guys who are minding the store'' unless President Clinton or Gore missteps in reacting, Young said. Bush's running mate, former Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, said of a U.S. response to the ship attack, ``We'd better find out who did it and retaliate very forcefully.'' Gore's running mate, Sen. Joseph Lieberman, said, ``The United States must respond quickly, forcefully and unequivocally.'' Bush's performance against Gore in the foreign policy portion of Wednesday's debate will help Bush weather the emergence of the issue in the campaign, Republicans said. A number of independent analysts said both candidates helped themselves, and the race likely will remain tight. The final debate is next Tuesday in St. Louis. The foreign distractions came as Gore faced some tough tactical decisions. Aides say he is considering shifting more resources from battleground states that are not vital to his goal of 270 electoral votes to states that he absolutely can't win without _ such as Michigan and Pennsylvania. Doing so would be mean Gore has concluded that the race will be won or lost narrowly, and he will be outspent by the GOP. Democrats have already pulled ads from four states. The Bush campaign, meanwhile, has expanded its political map to states such as California and West Virginia. ``I just love it when a plan comes together,'' bragged Bush strategist Karl Rove at the debate.

Thursday was supposed to be a day of foreign policy highs for President Clinton. He was rolling back sanctions against Yugoslavia, where democracy has sprouted anew, and revealing the prospect of a historic visit to North Korea. But those glowing feats fell victim to sad foreign policy events: A deadly attack on a Navy destroyer docked in Yemen and intensified violence in the Middle East that even Clinton said is melting the prospects for peace ``before our very eyes.'' Just two days earlier, the White House basked in the glow of history. Clinton met with Jo Myong Rok, special envoy for North Korean leader Kim Jong Il, to discuss, among other things, what North Korea could do to be removed from the list of state sponsors of terrorism. Before Jo's visit ended, a joint U.S.-North Korean communique revealed that Clinton is considering becoming the first U.S. president to visit the reclusive communist nation _ something seen as inconceivable just weeks ago. After a day of fund-raising speeches in Pennsylvania, Clinton looked tranquil and happy Wednesday night as he stepped off of Air Force One, shopping bag from Tiffany &AMP; Co., in hand, heading home to Chappaqua, N.Y. so he and first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton could celebrate their 25th wedding anniversary. Clinton had loose plans to return to Washington early Thursday, announce that he was lifting an oil embargo and a flight ban against Yugoslavia, then spend the morning playing golf. Aides prepared press releases trumpeting the sanctions removal as ``a first step toward ending Serbia's isolation.'' Instead, the president was awakened early Thursday by his national security adviser with news that a small boat had exploded beside the USS Cole as it docked in the Arabian Peninsula; Some sailors were dead, a dozen were missing. Then came word that two Israeli soldiers _ later updated to three _ were killed by a Palestinian mob, and Israeli helicopters had fired rockets at Yasser Arafat's residential compound in retaliation. ``The president obviously was horrified,'' said White House spokesman Jake Siewert. Clinton called Defense Secretary William Cohen about the ship attack, then launched a round of phone calls to Arafat, British Prime Minister Tony Blair, United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak. Grim-faced, Clinton rushed to the airport for the short flight back to Washington, then went directly to the White House for national security briefings. About two hours later, he appeared in the White House Rose Garden, appealing for a cease-fire in Israel and decrying the ``act of terrorism'' against the USS Cole. ``If their intention was to deter us from our mission of promoting peace and security in the Middle East, they will fail, utterly,'' Clinton said. However, he admitted, ``The alternative to the peace process is now no longer merely hypothetical. It is unfolding today before our very eyes.'' With that, Clinton went back to work in the Oval Office. He never mentioned Yugoslavia or North Korea.

Despite the known risks of terrorism in Yemen, American ships like the destroyer Cole have made refueling stops there 12 times in recent months as part of an American strategy to improve ties with the Arab country. After consultations with the White House and the State Department, the Pentagon decided last year that Navy ships would refuel in Yemen's deep sea port of Aden, at the southern tip of the Arabian peninsula. Security precautions were taken on each occasion, Pentagon officials said Thursday, adding that there had been no specific intelligence warning of a threat to the Cole when it visited the port. Yemen, an impoverished nation of some 16 million people, refused to join the allies against Iraq during the gulf war and has been a haven to international terrorist groups, who operate and train in its hinterlands, according to the current State Department report on terrorism. ``We have been working to improve our relations with Yemen for some time,'' Admiral Vern Clark, chief of naval operations, said Thursday. ``And I'm sure that that was at the heart of the motivation'' of commanders in the region when they established refueling operations at Aden, he said. U.S. officials said Thursday that the budding relationship with Yemen had recently seemed to be bearing fruit. In April, Yemen's president, Ali Abdullah Saleh, visited Washington and met with President Clinton. And as allied forces in the region have intercepted ships accused of violating the sanctions against Iraq, Yemen has allowed them to bring the offending vessels to the port at Aden, another step that distanced Yemen from Iraq, and angered the Iraqis. In recent days, however, Yemen's government had helped organize massive demonstrations against Israel and the United States in Aden, in the capital Sana'a and other cities, residents said. Gen. Anthony Zinni, the recently retired Pentagon regional commander for the Middle East, pressed the decision to brave the mixed security situation in Yemen, Pentagon officials said. ``In the last couple of years, Yemen has been doing a better job trying to control terrorism,'' said Kenneth Bacon, the Pentagon spokesman. ``We obviously felt that it was safe to take our ships there.'' All ships in the area prepare and follow a detailed security plan against possible terrorist attack, Pentagon officials said. ``I don't think we missed any specific threats,'' Defense Secretary William S. Cohen said. ``There are general threats in the region, and we understand that. And that's the reason why we have such precautionary measures we take.'' The ship came into the port at the second-highest level of alert, Clark said, and the sailors had undergone security training before this mission. Clark refused to discuss details of the security measures involved. Officials said that security training includes precautions against terrorist attacks from small boats, but that in this case the boat appeared to be part of the refueling operation itself and was not suspect. The Cole was the 12th U.S. ship to visit Yemen, and the third since May, officials said. Even though the State Department dropped Yemen from its list of terrorist nations 10 years ago when North Yemen merged with formerly Marxist South Yemen, diplomats say the Yemeni government is too weak to control radical groups from Palestine, Egypt, Libya and Algeria. Saleh, the former army general who is Yemen's president, denied that terrorists were responsible for Thursday's explosion. ``Yemen does not have any terrorist elements, and there is no relationship between this and what is happening in the occupied territories,'' Saleh told CNN, referring to Gaza and the West Bank. But Daniel Benjamin, an anti-terrorist expert who recently resigned from the National Security Council, said, ``Yemen is a troubled spot because central authority is limited largely to control of a few major centers.'' He added, ``There is no shortage of bad actors who would like nothing better than to attack the United States.'' The groups stationed in and around Yemen include Hamas, the Palestinian Islamic Jihad and sympathizers or members of other international terrorist groups like the Egyptian Islamic Jihad, al-Gama'at al-Islaymiyya and the Algerian Armed Islamic Group, according to the State Department terrorism report. Other experts suggested that Osama bin Laden, who the United States believes was behind the bombing of two American embassies in Africa in 1998, comes from an ethnic Yemeni family and has influence there, as does Iraq. The American ships refueling in Aden, which are part of the fifth fleet, largely help enforce the sanctions against Iraq. ``It's really too early to speculate, but you have to ask who is angry enough at us to attack an American target, and you may pick the Iraqis,'' said Jerry Bremer, a former State Department terrorist expert who this year chaired a national commission on terrorism. A land of arid, rocky deserts and remote mountains, Yemen has existed in its present form only since 1990, when the two Yemens that emerged from Turkish and British colonial domination in the 19th and 20th centuries were united. The union has been uneasy, and a civil war in 1994 that ended in victory for the new national government in Sana'a left deep schisms, with tribal fiefdoms in the hinterland that have served as strongholds for the Islamic terrorist groups. Armed groups have made targets of American, British and other foreign visitors and institutions, including tourists who began returning in the mid-1990s to explore the remains of ancient civilizations. Without the oil resources of its richer neighbors, Yemen has sent many thousands of its people to work in richer and less populous Arab states, often manning their militaries. Many Yemenis also fought with the mujahedin against Soviet forces in Afghanistan in the 1980s.

Among officials in his home country, Nobel Prize winner Gao Xingjian is ``persona non grata,'' a defiant author and playwright who left China years ago. In the United States, even within the literary community, he is pretty much a non-person. ``I know the name but I'm afraid I've never read him,'' said a leading U.S. critic, Harold Bloom. ``I'm afraid I don't know his work,'' said Richard Foreman, a leading avant-garde playwright. ``I am not familiar with Mr. Gao Xingjian's work well enough to comment,'' said author Ha Jin, a fellow Chinese exile who last year won the National Book Award for his novel ``Waiting.'' Gao is the first Chinese writer to receive the literature prize and his story is well worth telling. In announcing Thursday that he had won the Nobel, the Swedish Academy cited Gao for the ``bitter insights and linguistic ingenuity'' in his writings about the ``struggle for individuality in mass culture.'' Gao, ``very, very surprised'' by the honor, declared writing to have been his salvation, even during Mao Tse-tung's brutal 1966-76 Cultural Revolution, when intellectuals were silenced and he had to burn ``kilos and kilos'' of his writings lest they fall into the wrong hands. Gao went on to become a leading cultural figure in China but fled in 1987 after one of his plays was banned and he was put under police surveillance. After the 1989 blood bath at Tiananmen Square in Beijing, he wrote ``Fugitives,'' set against the background of the slayings. The Communist regime declared him ``persona non grata'' and banned his works. The author now lives in France. Until now, Gao has been far better known in China and Europe than in the U.S. A search on the online store Amazon.com turned up just one book, ``The Other Shore,'' a compilation of plays published by the Hong Kong-based Chinese University Press. But Gao's work is already catching on. That title, so rarely in demand that it's not immediately available from Amazon.com, on Thursday quickly reached the retailer's top 20. Nobels do a better job confirming fame than creating it. Past winners such as Ernest Hemingway and Samuel Beckett would likely be just as celebrated now even without the prize. Other winners such as Yugoslavia's Ivo Andric and Iceland's Halldor Laxness remain relatively obscure. ``If it's an obscure author, although you have a bump in demand, you essentially have quiet backlist sales after the first two years,'' said Laurie Brown, vice president of marketing for Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux, which publishes Nobel laureates Nadine Gordimer and Seamus Heaney. Morgan Entrekin, publisher of Grove Atlantic Press, said the prize was a great help in increasing sales for Nobel laureate Kenzaburo Oe. Sales of his novel ``A Personal Matter'' jumped from a few hundred to 50,000 after the Japanese author won in 1994. Entrekin has since published the 1997 winner, Italian playwright Dario Fo, and has his eye on Gao. ``Yes, I'm interested in him,'' he said. ``And as I soon as I'm done with this interview I'm going to find out more about him.'' ___ On the Net: Nobel Web site: http://www.nobel.se

The crippled warship USS Cole was listing but still afloat in a Yemeni port as investigators tried to find who planned its apparent bombing and the Navy broke the sad news to families of sailors dead, missing or injured. ``We will find out who is responsible and hold them accountable,'' President Clinton declared. The tragedy was all the more shocking given that U.S. forces in the Middle East have been on a heightened state of alert in recent days because of spiraling Israeli-Palestinian turmoil and considerable anti-American sentiment in the region. ``If their intention was to deter us from our mission of promoting peace and security in the Middle East, they will fail, utterly,'' Clinton said in the Rose Garden just hours after Thursday's explosion in the port of Aden, Yemen. Defense Secretary William Cohen said he knew of no other specific threats against American forces in the region, but said he ordered an increased alert level for all U.S. forces around the world, including those in the United States. Pentagon officials said that in a cunning slip through Navy security, suicide bombers drove a small boat with explosives up to the guided-missile destroyer as it made a refueling stop in Aden. The Navy said the toll was six crew members killed, 35 injured and 11 missing. Officials were working late Thursday night to notify families and said they would release no names of casualties until Friday. They did say women were among the casualties. The parents of sailor Craig Wibberley, 19, of Williamsport, Md., confirmed Thursday night that their son was killed in the bombing, according to The Herald-Mail of Hagerstown, Md. After the attack, ambulances rushed to the port, and Americans working with Yemeni authorities cordoned off the area. The ship was listing four degrees. Yemeni police sources said without elaboration that a number of people had been detained for questioning; it was not clear whether any were suspects. The State Department issued a worldwide alert, saying it was extremely concerned about the possibility of violence against U.S. citizens and interests. The Cole attack was the first targeting the U.S. military in Yemen since the Pentagon pulled out all 100 American military personnel there in January 1993 after bombings outside the U.S. Embassy and at hotels where some Americans were staying. U.S. intelligence has blamed Osama bin Laden's Al-Qaida organization for some of those incidents. With its 350 crew members, the Cole was en route to the Persian Gulf to help catch ships smuggling goods in violation of the U.N. embargo against Iraq. ``I have no reason to think this was anything but a senseless act of terrorism,'' said Adm. Vern Clark, the chief of naval operations. The United States dispatched investigators, intelligence experts and diplomats to the site of the explosion, and the government of Yemen promised to cooperate. Among questions they would try to answer: What type and strength of explosive was it that ripped the 20 foot by 40 foot hole in the hull of one of the world's most advanced warships? The explosion was the deadliest attack against the U.S. military since the bombing of an Air Force barracks in Saudi Arabia in 1996 that killed 19. Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh visited some of the injured who were hospitalized locally. But he disagreed with the main assumption of the U.S. investigation. ``I don't think it's a terrorist attack,'' he said. The Cole, a $1 billion vessel based at Norfolk, Va., had just arrived in the harbor and was scheduled to leave in about four hours, officials said. Clark said he couldn't fault the Cole's crew for failing to prevent the midday attack that apparently was carried out by two men in a small harbor craft that was helping tie up the ship's mooring lines at the port's fueling facility. The Cole was following proper security rules when it was attacked, Clark said. ``We don't automatically suspect people that are sent forward to help us,'' Clark said. William Arkin, a military expert who specializes in Gulf affairs, said Yemen became a more frequent refueling stop for Navy ships following a December 1997 U.S. government policy decision to open up contacts and cooperation with the country. ___ On the Net: Defense Department: http://www.defenselink.mil/ State Department Bureau of Near Eastern Affair's country page on Yemen: http://www.state.gov/www/regions/nea/country/cp_yemen.html

A loud bang drew Shaher Mohammed Saeed to his office windows at the state radio and television building overlooking Aden's port. He looked out to see a thick column of smoke billowing from the U.S. Navy destroyer USS Cole. An explosion just offshore ripped a gaping hole in the 9,100-ton USS Cole, one of the world's most advanced warships, killing six crew members, injuring 35, and putting Yemen at the center of what appears to be an act of terrorism against the United States. Eleven others were missing. The attack at the port's fueling facility came amid anti-U.S. fervor in the region sparked by more than two weeks of Israeli-Palestinian clashes. There was no immediate claim of responsibility. Ahmed Mohammed al-Naderi was sitting at his desk in the port-side hotel he manages when the building shook from the explosion. The blast ``was so loud I thought it was from inside the hotel,'' al-Naderi said. ``Thank God, none of the guests or hotel personnel were injured,'' al-Naderi said. His white, nine-story hotel, built in 1957 but refurbished five years ago, remained open with only a few guests. Police officials in Yemen, a nation on the southern tip of the Arabian Peninsula on the Red Sea, said that a number of people had been detained for questioning but would not say whether any were considered suspects. The blast broke windows along the Red Sea coast in homes and businesses _ including Al-Naderi's Rock Hotel. A car that had been passing by about 60 feet from the ship was overturned. The fate of the car's occupants wasn't known. Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh was shown on national television visiting some of the wounded, who included at least two Yemenis. He called for an investigation and rejected allegations from U.S. officials that terrorists were behind the explosion. ``The American ships have been coming for quite some time and nobody shows anger,'' said Mohammed el-Attar, a Yemeni journalist in Aden, one of the deepest ports in the world. Yemen has in the past bristled at suggestions it harbored anti-American elements. When the recent Hollywood movie ``Rules of Engagement'' showed Yemenis rioting outside the U.S. Embassy in Yemen, Yemeni officials objected it was a ``barbaric and racist'' portrayal and noted there had not been an anti-U.S. riot in the country in almost a decade. But Yemen saw small bombings outside the U.S. Embassy and at hotels where Americans were staying in 1993. Yemen became a more frequent refueling stop for Navy ships following a U.S. decision in December to open up contacts and cooperation with the country. In recent days, angry street protests have erupted in Yemen and many of its neighbors over what many Arabs see as U.S.-backed Israel's harsh response to Palestinian protests. Sixteen days of Israeli-Palestinian clashes have left more than 90 people dead, most of them Palestinians. Saleh has been criticized for calling for an Arab war against Israel. He says the media ``twisted'' his words. Yemeni Prime Minister Abdul-Karim al-Iryani told The Associated Press in March that wanted terrorist Osama bin Laden at one time had ``colleagues'' in Yemen, but now ``has no place in Yemen, no military camps.'' The United States accuses bin Laden of organizing a militant network with followers across the Mideast, including Yemen, and says he masterminded 1998 bombings against the U.S. Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, which killed 224 people. Yemen was one of the countries where members of the Palestine Liberation Organization settled after losing a base in Lebanon. Few Palestinians remain in Yemen today.

A bigger ship wouldn't have had a chance against the USS Cole. In battle, her weaponry was designed to take on squads of enemy aircraft, submarines and missiles. Enemy radar might have mistaken her stealthy image for a fishing boat. But it was a tiny bomb-laden, possibly rubber boat _ that appeared to be on a routine mooring operation _ which proved the toughest match for the 505-foot Arleigh-Burke-class guided missile destroyer and her crew of 350 highly trained Naval men and women. The massive but speedy $1 billion USS Cole, powered by four jet engines similar to those used in airliners, is one of the Navy's most advanced warships, built around the high-tech Aegis combat system which employs the latest anti-aircraft and anti-submarine technology. It carries batteries of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, a cannon that can launch five-inch shells more than 10 miles and two Gatling guns that each can fire 50 bullets a second. Admiral Vernon Clark, chief of naval operations, said the ship's hull varies in thickness but is covered with half-inch steel at the waterline that is capable of withstanding 51,000 pounds per square inch where the powerful explosion ripped it open. The destroyer's ``vital spaces'' are protected by 70 tons of armor, according to Jane's Fighting Ships. Most of its exterior walls are slanted so they are less easily detected by enemy radar. With that and added anti-radar protection, it casts a tiny image on enemy screens. The primary mission of the USS Cole is to defend some the Navy's biggest ships in aircraft carrier battle groups against multiple air, surface and submarine attacks. It was blown open in the Yemen port of Aden early Thursday by one of the smallest crafts on the water. U.S. authorities were investigating, but an early eyewitness account from an Army major who works at the U.S. Embassy in Yemen described the attacking vessel as a small rubber boat. The destroyer, based at Norfolk, Va., is assigned to the USS George Washington battle group now operating in the Persian Gulf region. The ship commanded by Cmdr. Kirk S. Lippold left Norfolk in June for a six-month deployment. It has a top speed of more than 33 mph. Named for the mythical shield of Zeus, the Aegis system is a suite of computer-linked radar and weaponry. Unlike the standard radar with a rotating wand, Aegis's SPY-1D phased-array radar sends out a blizzard of impulses to create a digitized image of an operational area on large blue screens. Its computers can identify incoming enemy missiles or aircraft as far as 200 miles away. Commissioned in 1996, the Cole was named Sgt. Darrell S. Cole of Flat River, Mo., first U.S. marine killed at Iwo Jima the day 30,000 landed, Feb. 19, 1945. Its motto: ``Determined Warrior.'' Following an ancient shipbuilding tradition, the ultramodern Cole reportedly carries coins embedded in its mast by Cole relatives: 67 cents for its hull number, including 1920 and 1945 quarters for the years its namesake was born and died. Tradition says the coins will ensure payment of the crew for the voyage home in the event of mishap.

For relatives of sailors aboard the USS Cole, the wait was agonizing. Denise Overturff of Norfolk knows she's one of the lucky ones. Her husband, Robert, survived Thursday's explosion in a Yemeni harbor that killed at least six crew members and injured 35. Eleven others were missing. Still, her joy over her husband's survival was tempered by other emotions, Overturff said. ``I've been thinking about the other families, and my heart just goes out for their tragedies,'' she told The Associated Press Thursday night. The 505-foot long, 8,600-ton destroyer is based at the huge naval base in this Virginia port city. Overturff's husband has been aboard the ship for about a year. ``They just told me he was A-OK,'' she said with a sigh of relief. ``They're telling us they don't know anything else until they assess the damage and figure out what's what.'' She tried throughout the day Thursday to get through on a hot line promising information to family members. But hundreds of other relatives jammed the lines. Overturff eventually got an answer. ``Making that call was the hardest thing I've ever had to do,'' she said. ``I'm just exhausted.'' Senior Chief Petty Officer John Henderson was in the control room of the ship when the explosion hit, said his wife, Carin Henderson of Chesapeake. All she knows is that he was ``injured, and that he's in the hospital.'' Henderson left work when she learned of the explosion and watched TV all day. Then she got a call from one of her husband's former commanding officers. ``Of course, my heart stopped,'' she said. John Henderson, an 18-year Navy veteran, plans to retire after this tour of duty, his wife said. Virginia Brown of Norfolk was among 150 relatives who came to the Norfolk Naval Station seeking information. ``Frantic, panic'' was how Brown described her mood. ``You pray a lot, cry a lot. Your mind just wanders. You try to picture the ship and picture where your husband can be.'' Leslie Roper, a regional civilian ombudsman for Navy families, said relatives tend to ``come together to try to support each other'' in times of crisis. City officials also rallied to help the families. Norfolk Mayor Paul D. Fraim urged the community to show support for the Navy. Among his recommendations was that people attending a concert by country singer Lee Greenwood Friday night bring candles for a moment of silence. Navy officials said all next of kin of Cole crew members would be notified about their loved one's status, and relatives of crew members who were killed would be notified in person. ``I'm just glad I got word over the phone, and not a visit,'' Overturff said. ____ Relatives hoping to find out information on those aboard the USS Cole can call 800-368-3202. ___ On the Net: USS Cole: http://www.spear.navy.mil/ships/ddg67 Norfolk Naval Station: http://www.navstanorva.navy.mil

The bombing of a U.S. warship and increasing violence in the Middle East prompted the State Department to close many of its embassies and consulates for the weekend. All posts in the Middle East, the Persian Gulf region and north Africa will be closed to public business until Monday, as will those in Nigeria, Tanzania, Senegal, Mauritania, Djibouti, South Africa, Kenya, Pakistan and Sierra Leone. In each case, U.S. personnel will remain on the job to look out for the interests of Americans, the department said. The announcement came a day after the USS Cole, one of the Navy's most advanced warships, was bombed during a refueling stop in Yemen and violence increased in Israel, Gaza and the West Bank.

The presumed death toll in the bombing of the U.S. Navy warship in Yemen rose to 17 on Friday, while an explosion rocked the British Embassy 200 miles away in the Yemeni capital. Windows shattered but nobody was hurt at the embassy in San`a. Britain's foreign secretary said a bomb may have been flung into embassy grounds. Authorities were investigating. The new attack came as American military planes evacuated 22 of the 35 sailors injured in Thursday's blast to Germany for medical treatment. Navy officials in the United States said explosives experts who examined the USS Cole's damaged hull have concluded that the blast came from an external source, bolstering the contention that it was a terrorist attack. The ship was refueling in Yemen at the time. Western diplomats in Yemen said the explosion seemed to be the work of a well-organized group with good connections in the port of Aden who might have provided the bombers with some logistical support. The diplomats, insisting on anonymity, said the boat used by the suicide bombers was similar to boats used by port authorities to guide vessels into port or facilitate ships with refueling. Seven soldiers have been confirmed dead and the families of 10 who remain missing are being notified that they are presumed to have died, U.S. Navy spokeswoman Lt. Cmdr. Cate Mueller said in Washington. Efforts to recover their remains were continuing, she said. Thursday's blast tore a hole 20 feet to 40 feet in diameter. U.S. officials say suicide bombers blew up a small boat next to the 9,100-ton destroyer. The French Defense Ministry said Friday its army planes had taken 11 of the injured overnight to Bouffard military hospital in Djibouti, where six underwent surgery. Lt. Terrence Dudley, a U.S. Navy spokesman, said 22 others were evacuated Friday to Germany. Two, apparently less seriously hurt, remained in Aden. In Germany, officials at the Ramstein Air Base said they were expecting bodies of the dead sailors to begin arriving later today and the injured late Friday or early Saturday. The injured were to be taken to the Landstuhl Regional Medical Center, a U.S. military facility. Dudley said some of the injured USS Cole sailors were in serious condition and others were stable. He did not elaborate. American investigators as well as U.S. Marines and soldiers filled Aden, bringing in equipment to search for clues beneath the water near the USS Cole. Sniffer dogs also were seen being brought to the area. Dudley said investigators may keep working at the site another two days. The USS Cole, one of the world's most advanced warships, was left slightly tilted in Aden harbor. ``The ship took (in) some water and we are trying to dewater it. But, generally, it is seaworthy and we will tow it to the United States,'' said Dudley, of the Bahrain-based U.S. 5th Fleet. The Cole is a $1 billion guided missile destroyer home-ported at Norfolk, Virginia. It was heading with a crew of about 350 to the Gulf for maritime intercept operations in support of the U.N. embargo against Iraq. U.S. embassies in the Middle East said Friday they had been ordered by the State Department to close public operations until Monday in light of developments in Yemen and escalating violence in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Anti-American sentiment has been running high in the Arab world, where protesters have been condemning the United States during demonstrations against Israel's actions in two weeks of deadly clashes in Jerusalem and the Palestinian territories. Yemen, an impoverished country on the tip of the Arabian Peninsula on the Red Sea, is known for its anarchic politics, streak of fundamentalism and routine snatches of Western hostages who generally are exchanged unharmed for government pledges to provide basic services. In Washington, President Clinton said Thursday that the USS Cole explosion appeared to be an act of terrorism, the worst against the U.S. military since the bombing of an Air Force barracks in Saudi Arabia in 1996 that killed 19 troops. ``We will find out who was responsible and hold them accountable,'' Clinton pledged. He dispatched to Yemen investigative teams from the FBI, the State Department and the Pentagon. Clinton also ordered a heightened state of alert for all U.S. military installations around the world. No one has claimed responsibility, Defense Secretary William Cohen told a Pentagon news conference. Yemeni officials privately rejected the accusations of a suicide attack, saying a joint investigation is needed to determine the cause of the blast. Dudley would not say whether any Yemeni authorities were involved in the investigation. ``The investigation is being done by our team and is being conducted quickly and fairly,'' he said. ``I can't go into the details of the status of the investigation.'' Yemeni police officials said a number of people had been detained for questioning. The officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, did not say how many or if any were considered suspects. Yemeni police and soldiers sealed off the port area, preventing ships and small boats from approaching the warship. Gen. Mohamed Saleh Gedrif, Aden security chief, refused to allow journalists into the port, saying the area is considered a closed security zone. The explosion broke windows in homes and businesses along the Red Sea coast and overturned a car passing about 60 feet from the destroyer. It wasn't clear what happened to the occupants. Yemen became a more frequent refueling stop for Navy ships following a December 1997 U.S. decision to open up contacts and cooperation with the country. Four years earlier, there had been small bombings outside the U.S. Embassy and at hotels where Americans were staying. Islamic extremists have been active in Yemen. However, Yemeni Prime Minister Abdul-Karim al-Iryani said in March that the United States' most-wanted terror suspect, Osama bin Laden, at one time had ``colleagues'' in Yemen, but now ``has no place in Yemen, no military camps.'' The United States accuses bin Laden of organizing a militant network with followers across the Mideast, including Yemen, and says he masterminded 1998 bombings against the U.S. Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, which killed 224 people. Yemen also was one of the countries where members of the Palestine Liberation Organization settled after losing a base in Lebanon. Few Palestinians remain in Yemen today.

Navy explosives experts have determined without doubt that the explosion that tore through the USS Cole, killing 17, ``was a blast from the outside,'' adding to the evidence that it was a deliberate act, Adm. Vern Clark said Friday. ``I've said all along, from where I stand, in my view this was clearly a terrorist act,'' Clark, the chief naval officer, said in an interview with The Associated Press. Navy officials said Friday that the 10 sailors still missing from the USS Cole are now presumed to have died. Seven bodies have been recovered. Officials said they expected to find more Friday. ``We don't want to destroy hope, but we don't want to create false hope, either,'' Clark said. Other Navy officials said the assumption is that the missing are dead, but there will be no formal change in their status until they are recovered, since the bodies are known to be inside the ship. Navy officials also said explosives experts who examined the ship's damaged hull have concluded that the blast came from an external source. ``There had been some talk that this was a blast internal to the ship; their conclusion is: no way,'' Clark said. ``Clearly it was a blast from outside.'' Clark said he was not aware whether the explosives experts reached any conclusions about the type or size of explosive used in the attack. Navy spokeswoman Lt. Cmdr. Cate Mueller said families of the 10 missing sailors are being notified that they are presumed to have died in the explosion. Efforts to recover their remains are continuing, she said. In addition to the seven confirmed dead and 10 missing, about 33 were injured in the blast Thursday. Lt. Cmdr. Daren Pelkie, a spokesman at 5th Fleet headquarters in Bahrain, said Friday that 11 of the 33 had been flown to a French military medical facility in Djibouti, and the 22 others were being readied for transport to Germany. Mueller said the Navy would release the names of the casualties when all families have been notified. Clark, interviewed on NBC's ``Today,'' said all but three of the families of the dead and missing had been notified. ``The individuals we haven't located yet aren't home. They are traveling some place and that's the challenge for us.'' A death toll of 17 would be the highest for a terrorist attack on the American military since the bombing of the Khobar Towers housing complex in Saudi Arabia in 1996, which killed 17 Air Force troops. Mueller said a team of Navy explosive ordnance disposal experts examined the damaged hull of the USS Cole and determined conclusively that the explosion was caused by an external source. It is believed to have come from a small boat that pulled up alongside the warship Thursday in the port of Aden and set off a high-explosive charge. The conclusion reached by the explosives experts strengthens the belief that the incident was a terrorist act, officials said. The divers who examined the hull now estimate that the hole created by the blast is 30 feet high and 40 feet wide, Mueller said. The initial estimate was 20 feet high and 40 feet wide.

South Korean President Kim Dae-jung won the Nobel Peace Prize on Friday for efforts toward reconciliation with North Korea that have prompted hopes for peace on the Cold War's last frontier. The 76-year-old president, who emerged as a symbol of pro-democracy struggle during 40 years as an opposition leader under authoritarian rule in the South, said he wanted to share the honor with his people. ``I thank all the citizens who love democracy and human rights, who have supported these efforts with our people,'' he was quoted as saying by presidential spokesman Park Joon-young. ``I will keep up my efforts for human rights, democracy and peace on the Korean peninsula, Asia and the world.'' South and North Korea, foes on the battlefield a half-century ago, have warmed to each other more in the last few months than in a generation. Their armies remain locked in a standoff across a sealed border, but the mood on the peninsula is considerably lighter. After patiently pursuing contacts with North Korea during the first two years of his presidency, Kim traveled to Pyongyang in June to meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong Il. The two countries then stopped propaganda broadcasts, held a reunion of separated families, opened border liaison offices and agreed to reconnect a cross-border railway. Kim ``is critical to this process and we are convinced that he will be strengthened by receiving this prize,'' Gunnar Berge, chairman of the Nobel Committee, said in making the announcement. ``There may now be hope that the Cold War will also come to an end in Korea.'' The prize is worth $915,000 this year. The Nobel announcement was greeted with great fanfare in South Korea, where the media have been betting for weeks that their president would take the prize. All South Korean television networks broke into their regular programming to report the news live from Oslo. People surrounded large TV sets, cheering and clapping when the announcement was made. Newspapers splashed front-page banner headlines with the award. Hundreds of fireworks exploded over Seoul in a celebration funded by a private company. ``I have never been happier. I think this will have a positive effect on our relations with North Korea,'' said Soh Soon-chul, 44, an office worker in Seoul. Kim entered politics in 1961 by winning a seat in parliament. He came to national prominence in 1971, when he almost beat then-dictator Park Chung-hee in a race that sent shock waves through ruling circles. His time as an opposition leader included more than seven years in prison or under house arrest and four years in exile before he was elected to a single five-year presidential term starting in early 1998 _ in the midst of the Asian financial crisis. South Korea's near-bankrupt economy dramatically recovered in 1999, although concerns remain about the pace and scope of the government's economic reform program. Speculation over Kim's prospects in Oslo had infused debate over Seoul's policy toward the North, which critics say is too solicitous. South Korea is donating grain and other aid to North Korea, and repatriated 63 former communist spies last month without asking for the return of Korean War-era prisoners in return. The Koreas were divided into the North and the pro-Western South at the end of World War II. The Korean War ended with an armistice, not a peace treaty. Their border is the world's most heavily fortified. This year's prize was a break with the committee's tradition of honoring both sides in a conflict, such as in Northern Ireland, the Middle East and South Africa, in the hope of pushing them toward a peace settlement. Berge defended the decision not to include North Korea's Kim Jong Il, saying he did not think a prize to one side in the Korean conflict would sour the process because ``North Korean will be totally dependent on people like Kim Dae-jung.'' He also pointed out that the committee acknowledged the North Korean leader's role in the last paragraph of the citation. ``The Norwegian Nobel Committee wishes to express its recognition of the contributions made by North Korea's and other countries' leaders to advance reconciliation and possible reunification on the Korean peninsula,'' it read. The peace prize, which went last year to the humanitarian organization Doctors Without Borders, capped a week of Nobel announcements. The literature prize went Thursday to Chinese dissident writer Gao Xingjian, now a French citizen. Americans James J. Heckman and Daniel L. McFadden won the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics on Wednesday for developing theories on how people work and live, research that contributed greatly to employment training, public transportation, communication systems and other areas. The physics prize was shared by Americans Jack Kilby, who co-invented the integrated circuit at Texas Instruments in 1958, and Herbert Kroemer; and Russian Zhores Alferov. This year's chemistry prize went to Alan Heeger and Alan MacDiarmid of the United States and Hideki Shirakawa of Japan for their discoveries in the use of plastics to conduct electricity. The medicine prize recognized Swede Arvid Carlsson and U.S.-based researchers Paul Greengard and Eric Kandel for discoveries about how messages are transmitted between brain cells, leading to treatments of Parkinson's disease and depression. The prizes are presented on Dec. 10, the date the prize's founder, Swedish industrialist Alfred Nobel, died in 1896. The peace prize is the only one presented in Oslo. ___ On the Net: http://www.nobel.no

ADEN, Yemen (AP) _ U.S. investigators converged Friday at this port where an apparent bomb attack on a refueling U.S. destroyer killed 17 sailors. Military planes evacuated the 33 injured to Germany and the east African country of Djibouti. More than 200 miles away in Yemen's capital, San`a, an explosion rocked the British Embassy on Friday. Windows shattered, but nobody was hurt. Britain's foreign secretary said a bomb may have been flung into embassy grounds. Navy officials in the United States, meanwhile, said explosives experts who examined the 8,600-ton USS Cole's damaged hull have concluded that Thursday's blast came from an external source, bolstering the contention that it was a terrorist attack. U.S. officials say suicide bombers blew up a small boat next to the destroyer, ripping a hole 30 feet high and 40 feet wide at the ship's waterline. Western diplomats in Yemen said the warship's explosion seemed to be the work of a well-organized group with good connections in the port of Aden who might have provided the bombers with some logistical support. The diplomats, insisting on anonymity, said the boat used by suicide bombers was similar to boats used by port authorities to guide vessels into port or facilitate ships with refueling. Seven sailors were confirmed dead and 10 missing since the blast were presumed dead, according to U.S. Navy officials in Washington. ``We are still conducting a search for the 10 missing sailors,'' Lt. Cmdr. Daren Pelkie said at the Bahrain base of the U.S. Navy 5th Fleet. Pelkie said more than 30 sailors had been flown to Germany for medical attention; they were expected to arrive before midnight Friday. Three seriously injured sailors were being kept in a French military hospital in Djibouti as they were unable to travel. The bodies of five soldiers arrived Friday evening at the Ramstein Air Base in Germany on their way back to the United States. Light rain fell as an Air Force honor guard silently transferred the caskets draped in U.S. flags from an Air Force jet into separate hearses. Flags at the base in western Germany flew at half staff, and sailors in dress blues stood on the tarmac during the ceremony. American investigators as well as U.S. Marines and soldiers filled Aden, bringing in equipment to search for clues beneath the water near the USS Cole. Sniffer dogs also were seen being brought to the area. The HMS Marlborough, a British frigate, was heading to Yemen from the Gulf to provide technical assistance, Dudley said. He said investigators may keep working at the site another two days. The USS Cole, one of the world's most advanced warships, was left slightly tilted in Aden harbor. ``The ship took (in) some water and we are trying to dewater it. But, generally, it is seaworthy and we will tow it to the United States,'' said Dudley, of the Bahrain-based U.S. 5th Fleet. The Cole is a $1 billion guided missile destroyer home-ported at Norfolk, Va. It was heading with a crew of about 350 to the Gulf for maritime intercept operations in support of the U.N. embargo against Iraq. U.S. embassies in the Middle East said Friday they had been ordered by the U.S. State Department to cease public operations until Monday in light of developments in Yemen and escalating violence in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Anti-American sentiment has been running high in the Arab world, where protesters have been condemning the United States during demonstrations against Israel's actions in two weeks of deadly clashes in Jerusalem and the Palestinian territories. In Washington, President Clinton said Thursday that the USS Cole explosion appeared to be an act of terrorism, the worst against the U.S. military since the bombing of an Air Force barracks in Saudi Arabia in 1996 that killed 19 troops. ``We will find out who was responsible and hold them accountable,'' Clinton pledged. There have been no claims of claims of responsibility that have gained widespread credibility. However, Omar Bakri Mohammed, a leader of Al-Muhajiroun, a London-based Arab militant group, said Friday he had received an international call claiming responsibility for the attack on the American ship. It was in the name of ``Muhammad's Army,'' an extremist group previously known to be active only in Chechnya and Dagestan. Bakri, who is known to have ties to terror suspect Osama bin Laden and extremist groups, said he was skeptical of the validity of the claim but that some of his skepticism waned after Friday's bomb at the British embassy because the group promised more attacks in its call Thursday. It warned that ``strikes will continue until the Muslim land and Palestine are liberated,'' he said. Meanwhile, a close associate of bin Laden urged Muslims worldwide to attack U.S. and Israeli targets to avenge the deaths of Palestinians killed in bloody and protracted clashes with Israel. Ayman el Zawahri, who was found guilty in absentia of the 1981 assassination of Egyptian President Anwar Sadat, faxed his call for jihad or holy war to the Islamabad bureau of the Abu Dhabi channel of the United Arab Emirates Television, bureau chief Jamal Ismael said. On Thursday, Clinton dispatched to Yemen investigators from the FBI, the State Department and the Pentagon and ordered a heightened state of alert for all U.S. military installations around the world. Yemeni officials privately rejected the accusations of a suicide attack, saying a joint investigation is needed to determine the cause. President Ali Abdullah Saleh on Friday ordered his security staff to quickly investigate the blast, though Dudley indicated the Americans are conducting their own probe. Yemenis are helping with security, he said. ``The investigation is being done by our team and is being conducted quickly and fairly,'' Dudley said. ``I can't go into the details.'' Yemeni police officials said a number of people had been detained for questioning. The officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, did not say how many or if any were considered suspects. Yemeni police and soldiers sealed off the port area, preventing vessels from approaching the warship. Journalists were barred from the area. Yemen became a more frequent refueling stop for Navy ships after a December 1997 U.S. decision to open up contacts with the country. The impoverished country on the tip of the Arabian Peninsula on the Red Sea is known for its anarchic politics, streak of fundamentalism and routine snatches of Western hostages who generally are exchanged unharmed for government pledges to provide basic services. Islamic extremists also have been active in Yemen, including the Yemeni Islamic Jihad and the Aden-Abyan Islamic Army. However, Yemeni Prime Minister Abdul-Karim al-Iryani said in March that the United States' most-wanted terror suspect, bin Laden, at one time had ``colleagues'' in Yemen, but now ``has no place in Yemen, no military camps.'' The United States accuses bin Laden of organizing a militant network with followers across the Mideast, including Yemen, and says he masterminded 1998 bombings against the U.S. Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, which killed 224 people.

The Bath Iron Works and its largest union tentatively agreed Friday on a contract that would end a six-week walkout by 4,800 shipbuilders, a federal mediator said. The agreement with the Machinists was reached after 36 hours of negotiations with mediators in Washington, said Elayne Tempel of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service in Portland. Details of the agreement were not immediately available. The union wanted better job security and higher wages. Union members will vote on the contract on Oct. 22. Bath Iron Works, owned by General Dynamics, has 7,600 workers and builds the Aegis destroyer. It did not build the USS Cole, the Navy ship attacked Thursday in Yemen. Shipbuilders voted to strike on Aug. 27. Talks broke off last week after both sides reported no progress, but negotiations resumed on Wednesday in Washington. The shipyard's highly skilled workers feared that cross training would weaken the value of the specialized work force and lead to layoffs. The company's last offer would have boosted wages 3.5 percent to 4 percent each year through 2002, half the raises being sought by workers. The union said its average worker earns $32,000 annually. The last strike against Bath Iron Works was a 99-day walkout in 1985. ___ On the Net: Bath Iron Works: http://www.biw.com Machinists union: http://www.iamaw.org

so what happens to the coal now and how might the navy be able to protect other ships against this? john m wethy joins us from the pentagon tonig. peter, first word the "uss cole" had been instruct by terrorists came from a u.s. army major. who had been sent out to the ship by the embassy as part of a greeting party. it just s happened he had a cell phone in his pocket 0, when all communications were knocked out and there was chaos on the ship, that cell phone became the only link to the outside world. as badly damaged as the "uss cole" may be, navy officials made it clear today that this $1 billion ship will not be scrapped. the crew will absolutely remain with the ship for all that aren't injured, and i think we'd have to drag them away. a preliminary inspection indicates that the keel of the ship was not damaged. if the ship is not broken, that is the keel is not broken, you can repair the ship with me ease. the more pressing question is what to do about security for other american ships in the region. the middle east is an area that is filled with risks. not just in yemen, but in other countries as well. the navy will now re-examine security that is provided for american warships in every port in the world. one small fix is likely to be more armed sailors on deck. but officials admit what happened in yemen, an attack so well disgazed, may be impossible to defend against, and worse, they say, it could happen again. so many of these investigations have started, and people become very pessimistic, because ultimately they haven't been able to feigned what they were looking for in terms of culprits. do they go off with any sense of timism this time? they go off with a sense of determination, peter. i think actually in some of the investigations, like the u.s. embassy bombings in africa, they feel they were suck until in pointing who was behind that. many thanks john m wethy at the pentagon this evening. most of those tailors who died or can't be found were young. but all over the country, whether they were young or old, the wait by their families was horrendous. here's abc's john martin. in dallas last night, the family of timothy gauna fearfully waited to hear the news. then, two navy officers arrived and went inside to tell them their son was missing. crying an uncle came out to speak through his tears. today he was listed as missing but presumed dead. another family refused to believe that their sailor daughter lakeina francis was dead. we know that she's missing, but as a family as a whole, we're not giving up faith. in georgia, sharon gunn's death was understood as a consequence of family duty. his dad spent 21 years in the navy, retired from the navy and i guess he wanted to do what his dad did. lake i said, he was a great guy. in san diego, she was a track star, her death stunned her coach. she overcame a lot of obstacles. i was proud of her for going to the navy. sailor ken clodfelter's family learned only he was missing and remembered his reassuring words he said mom, will you stop worrying, we're the most advanced ship, there's no way they can hurt this ship. we're ready, willing and able to take care of things. and, well, it shows that we're not. some families were so relieved. kathy and david huffman. thank god. is he okay? okay. thank you. sailor jennifer's grandmother. pure hell. because i -- you don't know what to could. and then good news. the last letter i got from her, she said i wish grandma i had one of your hugs. she's going to get them. by day's end as the pentagon revised the death toll to 17, hope was fading for those reported missing. all are now presumed dead. john martin, abc news, washington.

From NPR news in Washington, I am Corey Flintoff. FBI investigators are on the scene in the Yemeni port of Aden where yesterday's attack on a US navy destroyer left at least 7 sailors dead, 10 missing, and 33 injured. Defence Secretary William Cohen said this evening that Pentagon officials are now operating on the assumption that the missing sailors will not be found alive. A navy spokesman in Bahrain said about 30 injured sailors from the USS Cole had been flown to US military hospitals in Germany, 3 sailors had been taken to a closer French military hospital in Djibouti, West Africa. As investigators looked for clues to the explosion that crippled the Cole, another explosion in Yemen damaged the British embassy this morning. NPR's Julie McCarthy reports from London. Pro-Palestinian rallies have been held daily in Yemen, now the site of 2 attacks in less than 24 hours. US navy officials who have examined the hole of the damaged destroyer USS Cole have determined that the blast came from an external source, bolstering the conclusion the explosion was a deliberate act. Britain says the blast in its Yemeni Embassy was the work of terrorists. A powerful explosion damaged the compound's perimeter wall and shattered windows. No one was injured. Events in the Middle East dominate the European Union's informal summit today. Its agenda of internal reforms has been eclipsed as Europe, like the US, scrambles for ways to end the orgy of violence that has derailed the talk of peace. Fears of spiraling unrest have suppressed Europe's markets. Julie McCarthy, NPR news, London.

Elsewhere in the Middle East, officials from the FBI and the CIA and marine anti-terrorist specialists have arrived in Yemen to investigate yesterday's explosion that crippled the US navy destroyer, Cole. Seven sailors are confirmed dead and ten of the missing are now presumed dead. The wounded have been evacuated to Germany and to neighboring Djibouti. Djibouti is where until last year the navy conducted its Red Sea refueling operations. John Moore, a former government intelligence analyst says it was a mistake for those operations to move to Aden. I tend to fault the US policy that brought the refueling activity from Djibouti to Aden, given the abundance of threat indicators in the country, that being Yemen. It has been known for sometime that various groups, either Palestinians, North African groups, some of Bin Laden's men actively reside in Yemen. So again, I really question the wisdom of that policy. You say that the US was using Djibouti for more or less the same purposes that, for the last year or so, they have been using Yemen, that they knew that there was a much more anti American atmosphere in Yemen. Why then did they go there? Did they have some other overriding concerns? The US has been attempting to support movements for democratization in Yemen and there has been some attempts to buttress the government of Ali Abdullah Saleh and I believe that this is directly tied into that. There were elections held, I believe, a year or so ago. The Americans were involved as far as assessing and evaluating the validity of the elections, and I think this grew out of that policy of supporting the Yemeni government. But again the problem that the Yemeni government faces is they don't actively control the countryside. That is split between various tribal groups and there is also, as I mentioned, extremists that look at Yemen as, say, heaven. They have been there for well on 20 years, various groups at different times, of course. In terms of talking about Yemen and giving us a feeling for what is interesting about this country, another thing that is interesting about it would seem to be that this is a country that had pretty much sided, as I understand it, with Iraq during the Gulf war. Is that true and if so why is the United States involved with it now? That is true. The government of Yemen, led by the current President Ali Abdullah Saleh, did exhibit pro-Iraqi sentiment during the Gulf war. As far as the reasoning behind why the US is trying to rebuild its ties with Yemen, again the US policy is to try to build a bridge with as many countries as possible within a region, particularly the Islamic world. We hope the countries can become potential friends, if not allies, in the region. So there is a bit of, OK, yes we don't agree with what you did in the past, but let's try to put that behind us and look forward. And what have the developments there led you to believe about the wisdom of that policy? The wisdom of trying to establish ties with the Yemeni government, I can certainly see the logic behind that. Again my specific question comes in to why they moved the refueling activity from Djibouti to Aden, given the level of threat in the country. It is one thing to build relationships, it is another thing to put actually your men and women on the front line, when they didn't have to be there. John Moore is a research analyst at the Institute for Foreign Policy Analysis. He joined us in our studios here in Boston. Thank you very much. Thank you.

This is The World. I am Tony Kahn. There have been celebrations in South Korea following the announcement that the President Kim Dae-jung has won this year's Nobel Peace Prize. The Nobel Committee praised Kim Dae-jung as a leading spokesman for democracy in Asia. Heun Sung Kong reports from the South Korean capital, Seoul. President Kim's policy of promoting reconciliation between the two Koreas might yet result in a visit to the reclusive north by President Bill Clinton. The Norwegian Nobel committee has decided to award the Nobel Peace Prize for 2000 to Kim Dae-jung for his work for democracy and human right in South Korea and East Asia in general, and for peace and reconciliation with North Korea in particular. The Nobel Peace Prize caps an extraordinary lifetime's achievement. President Kim Dae-jung has been described as Asia's Nelson Mandela. As an opposition politician of 40 years standing, he was persecuted by successive military dictatorships. They even tried to murder him. He was sentenced to death for treason and suffered for years in prison in exile. Finished with his exile in the United States, Kim returned home despite threats and dangers of assassination. On his return to Korea, his welcome was unbelievable. South Korea's television networks have cleared their schedules to mark the occasion with specially prepared biographies. There have been fireworks in Seoul and a street party held in Kim Dae-jung's hometown. South Koreans reacted with joy. Kim Dae-jung has just won the Nobel Peace prize. What is your reaction? He is the first person to get the Nobel Prize in Korea, so it's amazing. We didn't expect. We are so happy to hear that. Anyway congratulations, Kim Dae-jung. Yes, very, very happy. For the long time, we were longing for the Nobel Prize. At last, we got one. The Nobel Committee particularly praised President Kim's policy of promoting peace between the two Koreas. This led to his unprecedented visit, last June, to the North Korean capital, Pyongyang. Now it looks as though he might be followed by President Bill Clinton. The US Secretary of State Madeleine Albright has already announced she will visit the Communist country. President Kim will likely see this as a vindication of his policy of engagement for the north. The distant turned President responded to winning the prize by pledging to continue with the Korean peace process. For The World, I am Heun Seng Kong in Seoul.

Several Islamic groups are claiming responsibility for the attacks in Yemen on a US destroyer and the British embassy. Seventeen sailors died when an explosion ripped a hole into the USS Cole in the Port of Aden yesterday. The BBC's Barbara Platt reports. A previously unknown group calling itself 'Martyrs of the Oaxa Mosque Uprising' said it had bombed the US destroyer to defend Islamic honor and to avenge the blood of Palestinians killed by Israelis with America's blessing. Arab anger at the high Palestinian death toll and overwhelming Israeli force is also directed at the United States, which is seen as biased towards Israel, and Britain is often associated with American policies here. A second group called 'Mohammed's army' said it carried out both the ship and the embassy attacks and that it planned to bomb all US and British embassies. Barbara Platt in Aden.

Accompanying last week's downfall of Yugoslavia's President Slobodan Milosevic was a drumbeat. We are not speaking metaphorically as in a drumbeat of freedom. We are talking about the real thing. The World's Stephen Snyder explains. This is the sound of democracy, Yugoslavian style. Veteran rock drummer Drugly Chorichech was frequently seen marching at the front of Belgrade protest parades, trailed by enthusiastic amateur drummers. In August, Chorichech and many of his musician colleagues joined forces with Yugoslavia's non-governmental organizations or NGOs to galvanize the youth vote in advance of the September 24th Presidential election. Echoing MTV's hip, outreach effort 'Rock the Vote', they call their project 'Rock for Vote'. The general idea was to get all the very important, very good and very young rock bands in Serbia to play together in all big cities in Serbia. Peter Yan Yodowich of Belgrade's independent radio TV Ponchevo said the concerts were staged for free. It was the idea, you know, just through the music, through the culture, to provoke young people to go out and vote. Yan Yodowich says that when it came to picking who would play, bands associated with the Milosevic government were not invited to apply. The organizers pick up only the best who've never had any contact with the regime. The roster of bands passing this political acid test was pretty wide ranging. Metal, Reggae and all rock bands, even a Serbian-Irish band performing jigs and reals. It was a travelling festival with ten of Belgrade's top bands going from town-to-town on a 24-city tour. One of the organizers Dragon Ambersage of Belgrade's Independent Radio B92 says, they had no trouble drawing crowds. People were literally starving for anything that is cheerful and have a certain message in the lyrics. People came to hear the bands but once they were there many also met the representatives of some 30 NGOs that set up their tables at every stop. Long established human rights and feminist groups stood alongside young activist groups such as Outpour, handing out literature and presenting a unified message. There is only one word, which is obviously in everybody's mind and it's the need for change. All the NGOs just said we are going to help this social change happen by joining together all our forces just to explain that it is so important to get out and vote. And vote they did. In the September 24th Yugoslavian Presidential election record numbers of first-time voters, young people ages 18 to 22 showed up at the polling places and cast their ballots. 'Rock for Vote' organizers were encouraged and B92s Dragon Ambersage says they intend to continue to support independent voices. Because of the future of this, what we are trying to maintain is to keep up with the independent position and be free to criticize anyone that we feel needs to be criticized. Radio Ponchevo's Peter Yanyodiwich believes the bands will play an active part in Yugoslavia's democratic future. All those kids are, musicians are, completely independent and I am really sure that in the next month and year they will be also criticizing this new regime if they do something bad. And the new regime better listen up. An estimated 150,000 people came to the 'Rock for Vote' concerts to hear music that captures the frustration of Serbian youth. 'Eyesburn', one of the younger groups on the tour, sings about growing up in a part of Belgrade so bleak that buses wont stop there at night. B92's Ambersage says the bands metal-edged reggae inspired anthems wreaked havoc among the audience. Music like this may have served as the rallying cry driving young people to vote and may be to start the revolution that brought Yugoslavia's new government to power. For The World I am Stephen Snyder.

Increased violence in the Middle East and an attack on a U.S. destroyer prompted the State Department Friday to close 37 U.S. embassies and consulates for the weekend. ``Obviously, in light of the history of attacks, you have to be concerned of additional attacks,'' State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said. ``We have also sent messages to embassies worldwide to be careful, to be vigilant and, in all these situations, to keep in very close touch with the American communities.'' At the same time, the spokesman said the closings did not mean the United States was withdrawing in the face of terrorism. All U.S. posts in the Middle East, the Persian Gulf region and north Africa were closed to public business until Monday, as will those in Nigeria, Tanzania, Senegal, Mauritania, Djibouti, South Africa, Kenya, Pakistan and Sierra Leone. In each case, U.S. personnel will remain on the job to look out for the interests of Americans, a department spokesman, Philip Reeker, said. ``We will continue to evaluate the situation,'' he said. The announcement followed the bombing of the USS Cole, one of the Navy's most advanced warships, Thursday during a refueling stop in Yemen and increasing violence on the West Bank, in Gaza and in Israel. At the White House, spokesman Jake Siewert said President Clinton talked by telephone with Crown Prince Abdullah of Saudi Arabia and King Mohammed of Morocco. ``We're continuing to work with everyone in the region there to do everything we can to break the cycle of violence and try to defuse tension in that part of the world,'' Siewert said. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright talked to President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt and Foreign Ministers Thorbjorn Jagland of Norway, Joschka Fischer of Germany, Igor Ivanov of Russia and Habib Ben Yahia of Tunisia, Boucher said. In a letter sent to President Clinton on Friday, 90 senators expressed their solidarity with Israel and criticized Yasser Arafat. They said they were dismayed the Palestinian leader and the Palestine Liberation Organization ``would allow violence by Palestinians to be carried out without restraint or comment.'' The senators said Arafat apparently either was trying to use violence to ``extort'' further concessions from Israel or he intended to end the peace process. In the House, 64 members introduced a resolution condemning Arafat and calling for support for Israel. Accusing the Palestinian leadership of encouraging the violence, Rep. Benjamin A. Gilman, R-N.Y., chairman of the House International Relations Committee, said Arafat was attempting ``to dictate Israeli concessions at the negotiating table through the unbridled use of violence, and, most appallingly, through the mainuplation of young children as `martyrs in training,'''

The USS Cole is a ``ship that was built to fight'' and will be returned to the fleet after the damage from a terrorist bomb is repaired, the Navy says. The challenge now is how to tow the $1 billion destroyer that has a gaping 30-by-40-foot hole in its hull _ and where to do the repairs. ``This is a very damaged ship,'' Rear Adm. Joseph C. Henry, head of Navy personnel and policy division, said Friday. Divers have already been in the waters of the Gulf of Aden, surveying damage to the guided missile destroyer, he said. And the rest of a team of several dozen divers, engineers and others experts was expected to arrive at the scene in the next few days to assess exactly what is wrong with the Cole _ it's hull, main structures, drive shaft and so on, said Navy spokesman Cmdr. Greg Smith. Then the team will recommend to the Pentagon ways the ship might be repaired enough to move, and where it might be moved to, Smith said. ``I would expect in the next week or so they will be able to ... know what they have to do to fix it, and perhaps even have completed the repairs enough to move it to a more substantial facility,'' said Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon. Complicating their work, said Smith, is the fact that it's a crime scene, meaning the FBI won't let the Navy do anything to the ship until agents are satisfied they've removed bomb fragments or any other evidence that might lead to the terrorists. The Navy could bring to Yemen a floating dock _ a structure large enough to lift the 505-foot-long, 8,600-ton ship out of the water for towing to a ship repair facility, he said. The 4-year-old ship is young by Navy standards, where the life expectancy of such a vessel is 30 to 50 years. ``The USS Cole is a ship that was built to fight,'' Adm. Robert J. Natter, commander of the Atlantic Fleet, said in a news conference Friday in Norfolk, Va. ``We still have a ship that is very capable and we obviously want to return that ship to full duty as soon as possible.'' As of Friday afternoon, the Cole was considered stable and had some communications capability, Henry said. The crew had restored some of its lost power as well. Two other Navy ships _ the frigate USS Hawes the destroyer USS Donald Cook _ were sent to the port of Aden to help the Cole and its crew. ``Obviously, the crew left on the USS Cole is tired and distraught,'' Henry said. ``And so the crews of the new ships can help do some of the work that's required to keep the ship afloat and to deal with the damage to the hull. So it's important that they have reinforcements there.''

Until now, voters have been able to consider Al Gore and George W. Bush in relative peace and quiet. No more. Middle East conflict and the attack on a U.S. warship, combined with some economic nervousness at home, are introducing unpredictable elements into the campaign and perhaps forcing people to look at Democrat Gore and Republican Bush in new ways, late in the game. Whether the new elements will be consequential is beyond the understanding of both campaigns. At this point, they are bewildered over how the violence and disquiet might play in the Nov. 7 election _ as alert as campaigns always are for a so-called October surprise. On one hand, Democrats consider Gore's years of experience as vice president a strength for him when matters overseas take a dangerous turn _ a point Republican strategists and supporters do not dispute. ``I can see how that might make people look at the candidates differently, like, 'Can they lead us at a time like this?''' Mike Scanlon, a Bush supporter and General Motors project manager, said while awaiting the Republican nominee's speech at a Pontiac, Mich., truck assembly plant. Said Democrat Dennis Dochterman at a Gore event in Cedar Rapids, Iowa: ``When there's uncertainty, people are less inclined to take a chance.'' On the other hand, it is a Clinton administration-mediated peace process that is falling apart between Israelis and Palestinians, and an economy that Gore has been running on that is causing some worries, with inflation up and the stock market swooning before rebounding Friday. Gore strategists prefer smooth economic trends, public satisfaction with the nation's overall direction, and no rude shocks _ however unrelated to the campaign _ in newspaper headlines. On Friday, a day after suspected terrorists blew a hole in the destroyer USS Cole in the port of Aden, Yemen, leaving 17 U.S. sailors dead, neither candidate was jousting outwardly for advantage. The White House was playing it somewhat carefully, too, even while offering a platform for Gore to show his experience. President Clinton's spokesman, Jake Siewert, welcomed Gore back as the candidate interrupted campaigning for a second day to join Clinton in meetings. But the White House did not exactly place him at the center of its crisis management. ``I think it was his decision to come back here,'' Siewert said. ``But the president ... always has appreciated his work on the Mideast peace process.'' While saying he'd let ``the experts'' decide whether the crisis helps Gore, spokesman Chris Lehane took the occasion to trumpet the candidate's strengths. ``The bottom line is that he is involved because he has a wealth of experience on these issues,'' Lehane said while flying to Washington. ``He is a valuable part of the foreign policy team at the White House.'' Given that Gore and Bush have not voiced major differences on Middle East policy, Andy Kohut of the Pew Research Center questioned whether the violence there will mean much in the election. Gore may have rushed back to Washington, ``but it's not as if he is being summoned home to find a way for peace, or to find a way to wage war,'' Kohut said, predicting little fallout from developments short of a significant threat to U.S. national security. Much the same sentiment was voiced in Cedar Rapids by Gore supporter Chuck Silliman. ``I think this administration can bring some stability to things if anybody can,'' he said. ``But I'm also impressed with what Bush had to say about politics stopping at the water's edge.'' Kohut noted, however, that each day devoted to problems abroad is one less day for Gore to pitch his prescription drug plan, challenge Bush on taxes or otherwise tangle with the Republican on domestic issues where polls suggest he has an edge. About three weeks are left for that, absent persistent distraction, after the candidates lie low for a few days to prepare for their final debate. ``What it might do is take attention away from the domestic issues and that, I think, would be bad news for Gore because he has more to gain from a focus on health care, Social Security, even taxes, than Bush does,'' Kohut said. But presidential historian Henry Graff of Columbia University said: ``If we get into a critical situation, we're going to look for tried hands rather than new hands.'' As for October surprises, Republicans feared that President Carter would pull one off in 1980 by winning the release of American hostages in Iran in time to take credit from voters and turn a looming defeat into victory. He didn't.

the white house says it's operating under the assumption that terrorists are behind the attack. investigators say they're looking at a number of mideast groups in connection with the blast, but so far, none have claimed responsibility. more from jamie m intyre. the blast that punched this through the 1/2-inch thick steel hull of the destroyer "uss cole" was as unexpected as it was deadly. according to an eyewitness account, the explosion occurred when a small boat, that was participating in the mooring, approached the "uss cole." the american sailors caught in one of the main engine rooms and on the mess deck above it were killed by the powerful blast. and three dozen sailors were wounded in what the pentagon says appears to be a suicide terrorist attack. according to pentagon sources in a routine maneuver, the small boat helped attach a mooring line to a off-shore buoy. but then, with the boat close by the warship, the two men seemed to stand at attention as the boat exploded without warning. my view is that, and the scenario that i have described to you, is that it would be extraordinarily difficult to have ever observed in time to do anything about this kind of situation and to have stopped it. the destroyer "uss cole" was en route from the mediterranean sea to the persian gulf to take part in enforcement of the oil embargo against iraq. because of the terrorist groups known to operate in yemen, it used to be off limits to u.s. ships but the cole, which left its home port in norfolk, virginia, this summer, refueled there in part because of a u.s. policy aimed at improving relations with yemen. the warship was scheduled to be there for only four to six hours meaning the attack had to be planned well ahead of time. given the magnitude of this blast, it couldn't have been put together in a garage overnight. somebody had to do some careful planning to cause this much damage, this much loss of life and injury to our loved ones. the pentagon says it's premature to blame the attack on any particular group. if, however, we determine that terrorists attacked our ship and killed our sailors, then we will not rest until we have tracked down those who are responsible for this vicious and cowardly act. in response to the attack, the pentagon has put all of its forces around the world on a higher state of alert, but until the u.s. completes its investigation, the pentagon could offer no assurances this kind of attack couldn't happen again. jamie m intyre, cnn, the pentagon.

At 5:30 Monday morning my phone rang. Oh, swell, I thought, somebody died. But it was good news. My brother, Paul Greengard, was calling. ``I just won the Nobel Prize,'' he said. He sounded as though he didn't want to talk too loudly for fear his head would fall off. It's a head filled with things I have never understood. I admire and love my brother, but he lives on a higher plane, and what he does is secret, unrevealable. To me, anyway. Once, when he was a young man going off to some lab or other, I asked what he was going to do that day. ``I am going to pith a frog,'' he said. Whatever that meant, it didn't sound good for the frog, and that was the end of my prying into his life in science. My mother said it was OK for me to turn away from scientific inquiry. ``We don't need another genius around here,'' she declared, thereby demolishing all three of us siblings with a single sentence _ my sister and me, because we weren't so smart, and my brother, because he was too smart for her taste. At 17, he joined the Navy and helped develop an early warning radar system to detect incoming Japanese planes. That's the last thing I remotely understood about his world. Every girl thinks her big brother is smarter and more glamorous than the next guy. My brother was. He even sang like an angel. And he kept moving. ``It is not worthwhile to go around the world to count the cats in Zanzibar,'' said Thoreau, but my brother didn't agree. After the war, he went to Hamilton College and got a degree in two years. I didn't know what he did there. Then he went to Johns Hopkins and worked in a lab all night and got his Ph.D. I didn't know what he did there, either. It wasn't that he refused to tell me, it's just that I couldn't make head or tails of it. He was a fool for education. I couldn't sit through a class without daydreaming _ so I elected a life in art. While my brother was in Britain, on a fellowship to Cambridge, I got my first acting part in a movie by a young director named Stanley Kubrick. My brother could follow what I was doing, but his pursuits remained impenetrable to me. In the late 1950s, he came back to the United States. He worked at the National Institutes of Health in Washington and then at Geigy Research Laboratories in New York. I'd go to dinner with friends, and someone would ask, ``What is your brother doing?'' ``I don't know,'' I would say. ``He's a genius, and they do all different stuff.'' They wouldn't have understood, anyway. But I did know he was involved in something exciting and mysterious, because every time he took a new job _ whether at Albert Einstein College of Medicine or Yale _ I'd ask him about it. Then he'd get into electro-physiological properties, and it was all over. When he went south, to Vanderbilt University, I made the mistake of asking what he would be researching. ``Thermodynamics of the adenylyl cyclase reaction,'' he said. That scared me so that I switched the subject to myself. I'd say, ``I'm singing in this Broadway show called `Tenderloin,' and George Abbot is the director and Maurice Evans drives me home.'' Or: ``I'm playing a juvenile delinquent in this soap opera called `Love of Life.''' Nothing intimidating there. No adenylyl cyclase involved, nothing that would make a person cry. Fated to be singed by the fires of intellectual achievement burning all around me, I accepted my lot and married a guy whose mother was Mary Chase. Back in the 1940s, she had won a Pulitzer Prize for her play ``Harvey.'' Meanwhile, I still didn't know what my brother did. But my opinion of my brother's greatness was confirmed by others who kept giving him dinners and awards. The food part was fine, but when they got to the talking part, I was back to square one. In 1983, Paul came to Rockefeller University in New York, to become the Vincent Astor professor and head of the Laboratory of Molecular and Cellular Neuroscience. Now, he has won the Nobel Prize in physiology and medicine, an honor he shares with two other scientists. In reporting it, the newspapers said their work on the way brain cells communicate might one day help cure diseases like Parkinson's and Alzheimer's. I'm thrilled he won. Now I know what he does.

Koreatown, always bustling, exuded special pride as residents learned the South Korean President won this year's Nobel Peace Prize. Among most Korean Americans, there was hope as well that Kim Dae-jung's award might speed reunification of the divided peninsula. ``They must allow families to visit and cross the border freely,'' said Harry Lee, 39, a pest control worker who left Korea three years ago with his wife and two sons. ``It's exciting. He's the first Korean to win the prize,'' said Elaine Kim, 20, a student working part-time at a gift shop. ``I'm proud of him.'' Kim, 79, was honored for pursuing contacts with North Korea. After more than a half-century estrangement, Kim traveled north in June for talks with Kim Jong Il. At their meeting in the North Korean capital, Pyongyang, the two leaders agreed to work toward eventual reunification. The nations then embarked on a rapid series of friendly gestures, including a reunion of separated family members, the reopening of liaison offices and an agreement to reconnect a cross-border railway. ``There may now be hope that the Cold War will also come to an end in Korea,'' the Nobel committee's chairman, Gunnar Berge, said in announcing the award. It's a hope Steve Kim shares. ``Four years ago, before he became president, no one visited North Korea. They didn't even think about it,'' said Kim, 25, a salesman at an electronics store. He moved to the United States from South Korea when he was 15, has relatives in the north and hopes to visit them. ``I hope we're like a Germany,'' he said, referring to the reunification of that country in 1990.

President Clinton, encouraged by the breakthrough in efforts to bring Palestinians and Israelis together for peace talks, was awaiting word from Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak on convening a summit, a top White House aide said Saturday. Clinton, who planned a political trip to Denver and Seattle, has been working for the last eight days to end the crisis in the Middle East and find those responsible for the apparent terrorist attack Thursday on a U.S. warship in Yemen that killed 17 American sailors. He canceled a political trip to Missouri and Arkansas on Friday and stayed at the White House to conduct telephone diplomacy with Mideast leaders. Aides said Clinton could travel to the region as early as Monday for a proposed summit intended to end the violence and get peace negotiations back on track. ``The summit has been proposed by Mubarak. We're awaiting word from President Mubarak as to whether he feels the conditions are in place to convene a summit,'' the administration official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity. Mubarak said he would host talks in the resort town of Sharm el-Sheikh ``as long as it serves the Palestinian interest,'' the Middle East News Agency reported. Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, who had been refusing to take part until Israel vowed to stop firing at Palestinian demonstrators at flashpoints in the West Bank and Gaza, agreed early Saturday to attend. U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan was in touch with Clinton and Secretary of State Madeline Albright during the night and said the peace talks could be convened Sunday or Monday without preconditions. ``We are encouraged by what Kofi Annan has said,'' the White House aide said. The president worked late Friday night to break the Mideast stalemate, but took a break shortly after 9 p.m. EDT to call those gathered in Little Rock, Ark., for a Democratic fund-raiser. He told them he remained hopeful for a breakthrough. On Friday, the president spoke by telephone three times to Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Abdullah. He also called U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, King Mohammed VI of Morocco, British Prime Minister Tony Blair and Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak. Clinton also talked to Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh about Thursday's explosion that tore a hole in the side of the USS Cole. Additionally, he spoke with Adm. Vernon Clark, the chief of naval operations; Adm. Robert Natter, commander in chief of the US Atlantic Fleet; Vice Adm. Charles Moore, commander of the 5th Fleet; and Cmdr. Kirk Lippold, commanding officer of the Cole. Vice President Al Gore, meanwhile, interrupted his presidential campaign to attend a two-hour National Security Council meeting where Clinton was briefed on the volatile situation in the Middle East and the attack on the U.S. Navy destroyer. Attorney General Janet Reno and FBI Director Louis Freeh were also at the meeting. ``Even if the violence stops it will be very difficult to move on to the negotiating table immediately,'' White House press secretary Jake Siewert said. ``Some sort of cooling-off period needs to occur before they can sit down and work through their differences.''

Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji tried to charm the Japanese public at a ``town hall'' meeting Saturday by laughing, playing a Chinese instrument and even answering a question about whether he was afraid of his wife. From the start, the tone of Zhu's six-day visit has been one of rapprochement as he seeks to calm growing worries in Japan about Beijing's military might. Both sides have also been careful to soft-pedal on the touchy issue of Japan's wartime atrocities, long a sticking point in previous talks between the two nations. But nowhere was the new message of friendship clearer than on the nationally televised show. A relaxed Zhu sat surrounded by a pre-selected studio audience of about 100 Japanese, who appeared enraptured by the premier and welcomed him with applause. The crowd broke into laughter when Zhu was asked about his reputation of being afraid of no one but his wife, Madame Lao An. After a laugh and a pause, Zhu replied, ``I am not afraid of my wife. I think she's cute.'' He later reached for a bow and scratched out a short Chinese folk song on an erhu, a traditional stringed instrument. Anti-Japanese feelings dating from Japan's brutal World War II occupation are common among Chinese, and Chinese military thinkers often rank Japan along with the United States as a potential opponent. More recently, Japanese have also begun to harbor anti-Chinese feelings, mainly because of fears about China's military prowess. And some Japanese feel they have apologized enough for their past. Japanese are worried whether aid to China might be funneled into military spending. Tokyo has given about $24 billion of aid called Official Development Assistance, or ODA, to China over the last 20 years. ``If China becomes a major military power, the meaning of Japan's ODA to China will surely come into question,'' the national Yomiuri newspaper said in an editorial about Zhu's visit. Japan was alarmed when Chinese ships sailed unannounced this summer into waters claimed by Japan. China calls the ships research vessels. Japan says some were warships. Still, Zhu's visit marked a striking contrast from the visit of Chinese President Jiang Zemin in 1998, when he lambasted Japan for its invasion of China in the 1930s and '40s and demanded an apology. Although Zhu _ known for his plain talk and reformist policies _ made clear that Beijing feels Tokyo has never apologized in official papers, he also said that whether to atone or not was ``Japan's problem.'' ``But I hope you will consider it,'' he said calmly. Earlier in the visit, Zhu conceded that the Japanese, not only the Chinese, were victims of wartime aggression. It remains to be seen whether Zhu has succeeded in his fence-mending mission or merely alienated public opinion back home by not taking a firmer stand toward Japan. Keiichi Nakashima, 65, a retired salesman, who heard portions of the TV show on the radio, was excited about Zhu's visit. ``It's really helped us establish human understanding,'' he said. ``Things will get tough for Japan if our relations with China aren't good.'' Tetsuya Chikushi, the host of the TV show, said he was impressed with Zhu's candor. ``It's epoch-making for a Chinese leader to say so much in his own words. I think it's great he had the courage and took the risk to do it,'' Chikushi said. Chikushi had a similar ``town hall'' show two years ago when President Clinton was in town. A woman asked Clinton how he apologized to his wife and daughter about Monica Lewinsky and whether he thought they forgave him. ``Well I did it in a direct and straightforward manner and I believe they did, yes,'' Clinton replied then. Zhu's toughest question was about China's human rights record. He defended China's efforts, reiterated that nations have different values and promised to listen. ``I consider this direct dialogue with the Japanese people extremely important,'' Zhu said. Acknowledging that some find his face frightening, he said: ``The problem is I don't laugh much when I speak.'' ``Please don't think my smiles are forced,'' he said. ``And please don't be afraid of my smiles.''

in the waters off the coast of yemen, two urgent missions tonight collecting evidence from the suicide bombing and retrieving bodies still buried in debris. 316 were aboard the "uss cole" when the terrorists struck. dozens were injured. 17 were killed. our coverage begins with nbc's joe johns. a plane carrying the bodies of five dead american sailors from the "uss cole" arrived today at dover air force base, as the first wave of forensics experts and investigators from the department of defense and the fbi arrived in yemen. their mission -- to continue the search for evidence and suspects in the explosion. also on the way, equipment to lift the "cole" out of the water and specialists to help retrieve the bodies of those trapped and presumed dead. we know there are spaces that are inaccessible. we know there are some remains in those spaces. we need to get in those and locate the remains that we anticipate finding there. though the work was only beginning, a top justice department official in washington predicted the outcome of the investigation. i'm confident that we will be able to determine who was behind the bombing and that those people, those organizations, will be held accountable, they will be punished. this critical phase of the investigation must be conducted both above and beneath the water on a tight time line. they'll want to get in there quickly because one of the problems when you're dealing with seawater is that it will have an adverse effect on your evidence. to further speed up the process, the fbi has now activated the strategic information and operation center in washington. conceived after the bombings of the u.s. embassies in kenya and tanzania, ensuring the fastest possible exchange of information between investigators and the decision makers. on the diplomatic front, the u.s. said the government of yemen is cooperating with the investigation, though that country's president disputes charges that his nation is a haven for terrorists. the justice department says no group or individual has been ruled out as a suspect, though many expect that whoever gets the blame will eventually be tied to the terrorist osama bin laden and the grieving continued today at the naval academy's football game against notre dame. a moment of silence to remember the victims of this terrorist act. joe johns, nbc news,.

in a simple, solemn ceremony on a sun-splashed day, the navy began to remember the fallen sailors of the "uss cole." when one is struck, we are all struck. and we join as a band of brothers and sisters. clutching american flags, often choking back tears, several hundred people gathered to commemorate the dead and to affirm they did not die in vain. this tragic event will not deter our service to our country. this strengthens our resolve and our commitment to our overseas presence and power. those sentiments, those emotions, were displayed last night, as well, when several thousand gathered at the norfolk waterfront in a candlelight vigil honoring the 17 sailors -- ages 19 to 35 -- many just starting their naval careers, some on their first tour of duty. all expecting to be home for christmas. today's ceremony, part of fleet week, marking the navy's anniversary, culminated in the unveiling of a statue, "the homecoming," a bronze celebration of what all sailors hope for. but on this day, also a reminder that -- the homecoming is not guaranteed, that those who put on our nation's uniform are always taking risks. tomorrow, another homecoming scheduled here, as some of the "cole's" injured return to their home port. today, however, was a tribute to those who will not. bob faw, nbc news, norfolk, virginia.

The architect of the plan to send U.S. Navy ships into the port of Aden as part of the larger goal of improving relations with Yemen defended his decision Saturday, saying he was trying to prevent Yemen from becoming a ``rats' nest'' of terrorist groups. ``It's important to not have in the gulf region places like Afghanistan that become rats' nests of terrorists and extremists,'' said Gen. Anthony C. Zinni, the plan's creator and recently retired Pentagon regional commander for the Middle East. ``We were helping Yemen help itself, and everyone in the region was interested in having us help them change.'' In a reversal of the common view of American diplomats that the U.S. military is too cautious overseas, Zinni said several planned ship visits had been vetoed by the American ambassador to Yemen, Barbara K. Bodine, who worried about the threat of terrorists. The decision to refuel Navy ships in Aden harbor has been questioned by some counterterrorism experts since the explosion on Thursday that killed 17 sailors on the destroyer Cole. The refueling stops, done in the port's waters and not at the docks, were meant to help revive the economic fortunes of the once-bustling port and give the government the imprimatur of respectability that comes with regular American visits, the general said. The constant presence of several terrorist groups associated with the Israel-Palestinian conflict and others active against Egypt and Israel prompted the Pentagon to approve Yemen's request to help create its own coast guard to control traffic on the Red Sea and the Arabian Sea. Zinni said he had also sent American special forces to Yemen to train the local military in counterterrorism tactics and the use of weapons. And senior officers and noncommissioned officers from Yemen are studying at military colleges in the United States. ``Our big concern was terrorists' ability to move in and out of Yemen,'' he said. ``We wanted to make sure the Yemen military knew what they were doing and knew to contact us if they had a situation.'' Now the Pentagon is reviewing security in Yemen to determine whether it should continue those refueling visits and who was responsible for the breach of security that led to the attack. The State Department has rejected suggestions by some Pentagon officials since the explosion that the American Embassy in Yemen was responsible for the ship's security in port. ``The responsibility for operational decisions, such as refueling and security, for all U.S. ships in this region rests with the commander in chief of Central Command,'' Richard Boucher, the State Department spokesman, said on Friday. Zinni agreed, and said that the Navy had conducted the negotiations with the port authority at Aden for the refueling services and that he was responsible for the initial assessment that it was safe to return to Yemen after that country had suffered more than a decade of civil war and strife. Yemen's strategic position on the tip of the oil-rich Arabian peninsula was the prime motivation for the general's recommendation, despite Yemen's refusal to join the allies in the Persian Gulf war against Iraq in 1991 and the constant presence of terrorist groups in its hinterlands. But the general said he believed that Yemen was making progress at controlling those groups and would eventually evict them, and he wants the United States to continue developing its relations with Yemen. ``We've had bombings in Italy, Greece, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, the Philippines, and I didn't hear anyone say it was because we were engaged in those countries,'' he said. ``What I hope is we stay in Yemen.''

The 39 U.S. sailors injured in the attack on a Navy ship in Yemen spent Saturday at a hospital in this idyllic corner of Germany _ some weeping, some taking to their beds in exhaustion, all remembering their 17 shipmates who didn't make it out. The sailors arrived earlier Saturday at the Landstuhl Regional Medical Center, the U.S. military hospital here, many for a one-day stay before heading back to the United States. They came to Germany in two planeloads _ an initial 28 with mostly minor injuries, followed by another 11 who were more seriously hurt. ``They were definitely in shock,'' said Navy Lt. James Glaspie, one of 11 military chaplains at the medical center to counsel the survivors. Several sailors broke into tears when they called their families back home after arriving at the hospital, chaplains said. Many just wanted to sleep. Two days earlier, the sailors were witness to the explosion that claimed their colleagues: The 17 men and women died when a blast tore a hole in the side of their ship, the USS Cole, while it refueled in the Yemeni port of Aden. U.S. officials believe the attack was the work of suicide bombers who blew up a small boat next to the destroyer. ``Some of them are still going through some emotional trauma from the death of their fellow sailors,'' hospital director Col. Elder Granger said of the wounded. One young sailor with severe leg injuries told chaplains he fought to survive, clambering up a ladder as water poured into the ship. His wife was pregnant and ``he wanted to see the baby,'' Glaspie said. He said a young woman officer _ the sole officer among the injured _ was tormented by having to leave those under her command behind. ``She was more concerned about her people than about herself,'' Glaspie said. Granger said 34 of the injured were cleared to return home Sunday, while five others would stay longer to be treated for serious injuries _ one with a punctured lung, another with burns to face and hands, and three with multiple broken bones. All were in stable condition, he said. Landstuhl is set amid rolling hills and fir forests near the French border. The hospital has often served as a way station for injured American military personnel on their way home. On Saturday, U.S. and German flags flew at half-staff at the entrance. Officials refused to identify the sailors and kept them isolated from the media, explaining that many had indicated they were still too distressed to talk in public. Before heading to the hospital, the wounded landed early Saturday at Rhein-Main Air Base outside Frankfurt. Many in the first group to arrive still wore shorts and T-shirts, wrapping themselves in blankets against the chilly fog as they descended from the C9 medical transport that had carried them on a 15-hour trip from Aden, Yemen. Some had bandages around their heads. Two had eye bandages, and four or five with bandaged limbs hopped on one foot without the aid of crutches. Not long after, another military transport left Ramstein to bring home the bodies of five of the sailors killed in the bombing. The caskets later arrived at the air force base in Dover, Del.

Thirty-three U.S. sailors injured in an attack on their ship in Yemen headed home Sunday after treatment by military doctors in Germany, but six shipmates who were more seriously hurt stayed behind. Wearing donated track suits against the fall chill, the sailors gave thumbs-up signs as they boarded the gray C-141 plane taking them to a Norfolk, Va., air base. Most were well enough to clamber up the rear ramp, but several were taken aboard on stretchers, including one brought by ambulance to the waiting plane. All were eager to rejoin loved ones after Thursday's apparent suicide bombing of the USS Cole in Aden, Yemen, that left 17 shipmates dead. The injured were evacuated Saturday to the U.S. military's Landstuhl Regional Medical Center. ``The sailors are in good spirits,'' said Capt. Richard Thornell, flight commander for the medical evacuation unit handling the trip home. ``They are more rested and anxious to get home and see their families.'' Some waved to waiting reporters as they left the Landstuhl hospital, set among peaceful fir forests in a western corner of Germany. Asked how they felt, one shouted: ``Great!'' Were they happy to be going home? ``Absolutely!'' Shortly after 1:30 p.m., their plane roared into the sky from Ramstein for the estimated nine-hour flight home. Three nurses accompanied the injured on board. Most of the injured suffered cuts and bruises, broken bones or eye injuries. Others limped as they got off buses that brought them from the hospital to the air base. A female officer _ the only officer among the injured _ had one arm in a cast; another sailor wore an eye patch. Petty Officer 3rd Class Johann Gokool of Miami was transported by ambulance after undergoing major foot surgery until early morning. Many of the injured sailors also suffered emotional shock, according to doctors and chaplains who talked to them at Landstuhl. Hospital officials said earlier that 34 sailors were cleared to return home Sunday, but doctors later decided one of those couldn't travel yet. Among the seriously injured was one sailor with a punctured lung, another with burns and several with complicated bone fractures. ``They're a little bit more sick and need stabilization,'' Thornell said. The United States says 17 sailors were killed and 39 injured in the attack on the USS Cole during a refueling stop. On Saturday, a military transport flew the bodies of five sailors killed in the attack back to the United States from Ramstein, a way station en route from the Middle East.

The hobbled USS Cole lost power and took on more water in Yemen's harbor on Sunday, and the Clinton administration renewed its pledge to be ``relentless'' in tracking down those responsible for its bombing. In what he called ``a minor setback'' to recovery operations, naval operations chief Adm. Vern Clark said the ship's crew was working to restore electrical power needed for communications and to pump water out of the destroyer, which has a huge hole in its hull. ``They're heroes _ they're fighting for their ship,'' he said on CBS' ``Face the Nation.'' The power had been restored Thursday after a suspected terrorist bombing blew a 40-by-40 foot hole in the Cole, killing 17 sailors. But officials said the generator system inexplicably failed again Sunday, stopping pumps and causing additional flooding. The crew brought the flooding under control, Clark said. Meantime, Defense Secretary William Cohen said there was no doubt that the explosion was an intentional bombing. ``We don't know who did it but ... we're satisfied this was clearly an act of terrorism,'' he said on CBS. ``We will be relentless in tracking down the individuals or groups who are responsible for this and we will see to it that they are held accountable'' President Clinton's national security adviser defended the Navy's decision to dock ships in Yemen. Sandy Berger said limited fueling options in the Persian Gulf require such stops despite the high risk of terrorism. ``This entire area is a high threat area. The military has taken substantial steps in this area,'' he said on NBC's ``Meet the Press.'' Berger said 25 ships have refueled in the Arabian Peninsula port of Aden in the past 18 months ``without incident.'' ``Obviously we have to find out what if anything happened in this particular case,'' Berger said. U.S. officials believe the ship was the target of a suicide attack from a small vessel packed with powerful explosives. If terrorism is proved, it would be the deadliest such attack on the U.S. military since the bombing of an Air Force barracks in Saudi Arabia in 1996 that killed 19. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said on ABC's ``This Week'' that she thinks the inquiry is ``moving'' and the United States is ``getting a lot of people in there.'' Among the names mentioned in the wake of the bombing has been Osama bin Laden. The United States accuses bin Laden of organizing a network with followers across the Mideast, including Yemen, and says he masterminded the 1998 bombings of U.S. embassies in East Africa that killed 224 people. Clinton, in a letter Saturday to Republican congressional leaders, said more than 100 military personnel, plus two Navy warships, were sent to Yemen to help with security, communications and medical needs. Berger said the Defense Department is investigating whether future ships will continue to refuel in the area. ``We need to wait for a very thorough review and determine if anything more could have been done and should have been done,'' he said. Aden's convenient deep-water port had been used as a refueling point for U.S. warships for about two years. Discussions also had been started on a possible permanent U.S. facility around Aden _ near the southwestern tip of the Arabian Peninsula and near the important straits at the southern end of the Red Sea.

today, u.s. secretary of defense william cohen promised to catch and punish those responsible for the bombing of the "cole" and defended the navy's decision to refuel ships in yemen as investigators continued their day at work. morton dean reports it's a difficult day for the sailors remaining on board. the stressful, monumental task for the crew on the u.s. carrier suffered a setback. the ship began to take on water and lost electrical power again. a difficult time became even more difficult. it led to the cancellation of a memorial service planned for the 17 sailors who lost their lives. details ares are becoming known about the damage, most obvious, the huge hole. but also the deck is buckled. evenhe superstructure is damaged. hatches twisted out of shape and bulkheads destroyed. rear admiral mark fitzgerald, who visited the cole, was stunned by the damage. i won't tell you whether the ship is going to sink or not sink, but there was considerable damage to the ship. according to u.s. officials here tonight, the most important questions about the atck remain unanswered. any details or speculation on who specifically, we don't know that at this point. with well over 100 u.s. investigators now in yemen, the search for evidence is now fully under way. it's been officially designated "operation determined response," and that suggests several things that the u.s., of course, is determined to discover who carried out the bombing and that any group who helped plan the attack faces a response from the u.s. military. the u.s. believes there are anti-american terror groups based in yemen. half the population lives in settlements with 500 people or less, and senior u.s. officials here say the government, although friendly to the united states, does not have full control over the entire country. yemen's president has repeatedly said an internal explosion rocked the "uss cole," but tomorrow u.s. officials expect him to announce that he has changed his mind. and tomorrow, the search for bodies will resume. ten u.s. sailors are still mi missing. morton dean, yemen. to learn more about yemen, to our website at abcnews.com.

The world's first woman prime minister died just minutes after casting her ballot in national elections. She was survived by her daughter, who is president of Sri Lanka, and her son, an opposition leader. Sirimavo Bandaranaike's death at 84 last week came also on the 60th anniversary of her marriage to another former prime minister, who was murdered in 1959. Her story is not unique. In South Asia, where women are for the most part treated as second-class citizens, they have often been thrust into power by the slaying of their husbands or fathers, or named as figureheads by male power brokers _ but in practice have turned out to be far from pliable. Similar modern matriarchies exist in neighboring Bangladesh and India, and Pakistan has also had a woman leader. Women in the subcontinent can be sold into marriage, banished if they fail to produce sons, and consigned to spend their lives serving men. Yet the daughters and wives of many politicians in this region, where political power is often defined along family lines, take over countries when their husbands or fathers fall, even though they have little political or professional experience. ``The people feel that the wife is the best to carry on,'' Bandaranaike told The Associated Press in an interview in 1988. ``They trust the wife to carry on the husband's policies more than anyone else.'' Bandaranaike added: ``There is a certain amount of sympathy for the widow. You can't deny that also helps.'' Bandaranaike was transformed from shy housewife into a political dynamo after her husband, Prime Minister Solomon Dias Bandaranaike was killed by a deranged Buddhist monk in 1959. She campaigned for her husband's party and was elected the world's first woman prime minister on July 20, 1960. It was six years before Indira Gandhi became India's first woman leader; nine years before Golda Meir took over in Israel, and 19 years before Margaret Thatcher began her three-term premiership of Britain. Bandaranaike went on to serve as prime minister in this island nation off the southern tip of India for three terms until she stepped down in August. Her daughter, Chandrika Kumaratunga, is Sri Lanka's president. ``People trust women from dynastic families. They have a certain charisma,'' said Kumari Jayawardena of the Social Scientists Association in Colombo. Indira Gandhi, daughter of India's first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, was known as the Mother of India. She was loved, hated, feared, respected. She abolished the princely estates of the maharajahs, intervened in Pakistan's civil war to create the new nation of Bangladesh in 1971 and led India into the nuclear age. Gandhi was installed as prime minister in 1966 by men who thought she would be pliable. She soon proved them wrong and stayed in office for 11 years, but governed with heavy-handed emergency powers for the last 20 months. Voters threw her out when democracy was restored, but she rebounded in 1980 to serve four more years as prime minister until Sikh bodyguards assassinated her. In neighboring Bangladesh, Sheik Hasina and Khaleda Zia both came to power following family murders. Hasina's father was the country's first president, Sheik Mujibur Rahman, assassinated in 1975. Her archrival Zia sought a role in politics only after her husband, President Ziaur Rahman, was killed. Both women were installed by male politicians in need of party leaders who could unite the ranks by invoking memories of once-popular presidents. But their bitter rivalry is often blamed for the legislative deadlocks and strikes that paralyze one of the world's poorest countries. Sunila Abeysekera, director of INFORM, a human rights center in Colombo, said women are often thrust into power as figureheads for male power brokers behind the scenes. ``In order to salve the male egos, selecting the widow or daughter of the assassinated leader becomes the way of defusing tension within the party,'' Abeysekera said. She doesn't like it. ``Politics in South Asia is quite feudal and the political power still lies in the hands of families,'' Abeysekera said. ``The work of individuals is still not recognized. That's a terrible thing.'' In Pakistan, Benazir Bhutto became the first woman leader of a modern Muslim nation when she won office in 1988. Her father, former prime minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, was removed from power and hanged by military dictator general Ziaul Haq in the late 1970s. Twice elected prime minister, she now lives in Britain and has been convicted in absentia of corruption. Her male successor, Nawaz Sharif, is also accused of corruption.

Yemen is a failed state on the mend just around the corner from Somalia, in a truly wild neighborhood. It has been a haven for international terrorists and radical Islamic groups and there is little evidence that the government has any control over them. Given these facts, some critics are already blaming policy-makers for placing U.S. forces in such a dangerous place _ and by extension, in all such places. Using a refueling stop to build stronger ties with a volatile and struggling Arab nation not only backfired, such critics say, it shouldn't have been tried. ``It's not worth the risk,'' said Richard N. Haass, director of foreign policy studies at the Brookings Institution who served on the National Security Council under President George Bush. ``Yemen has a bad record, and it's still a place where the government is unable or unwilling to take certain steps against certain terrorist groups. We must become more selective and more wary of who we do normal operations with.'' Others at least as numerous insist that the United States must not let terrorists dictate how and where it projects its presence on the globe. And to be sure, the United States is staying put in the Middle East. ``We have very large interests in the region that aren't just important, they are vital,'' said former Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Ind., who headed the House International Relations Committee. Hamilton's list of interests is a long one: unfettered access to affordable oil; protecting Israel's security; limiting the spread of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons and the missiles to launch them; checking the influence of Islamic fundamentalists; advancing economic development in the region. ``It would be an absolute victory for terrorists, if they're behind this attack, if we pulled back and stopped doing our job in the Middle East or elsewhere in the world, and we're not going to give them that victory,'' said the Pentagon spokesman, Kenneth H. Bacon. Indeed, say critics of withdrawal, wouldn't abandoning the field in places like Yemen just leave them open to getting worse? Everyone points to Somalia as the example to avoid. But it wasn't the worst case by any means. Consider, for example, the experts in the Reagan administration who put U.S. troops in a barracks at the airport in Lebanon in 1983. After the killing of 241 U.S. servicemen by a Shiite Muslim driving a suicide truck bomb in October 1983, U.S. resolve was badly shaken and there was a furious domestic debate over whether the United State should have brought in troops in the first place, or whether it should have done so in a different way. The alternative, which came to pass when the U.S. troops left, was Syrian control, for which everyone in the region is still paying the price. The thing that the Saudis, Egyptians and others in the region remember most about the marines in Beirut was not their arrival, but their departure. In Arab eyes, the marines simply cut and ran from Lebanon when the Syrians and their Lebanese allies made the cost of staying too high. Both sides of the leave-or-stay debate, however, ignore a simple point: that there are common-sense rules of engagement for doing business in dodgy places that could reduce the risks of operating in them. First of all, the diplomatic and military services should invest heavily in intelligence, preferably the kind using real eyes and ears, which can infiltrate terrorist groups and snitch. ``We're constantly reading the tea leaves very carefully,'' said one four-star officer with experience in the Middle East. ``You continually assess the intelligence, bounce those observations off others and gauge the host nation's level of security cooperation. These things don't stay on a flat line, they ebb and flow.'' Second, avoid stationing forces where they can become targets of opportunity and resentment. After the 1996 bombing of a housing complex in Saudi Arabia, in which 19 airmen were killed, U.S. troops in Dhahran were moved out of urban compounds into more defensible desert bases. Third, when traveling around the region, go well armed and avoid falling into predictable patterns that are vulnerable to preplanned attack. Fourth, to the extent possible, limit dependence on host-nation support for security, supplies and other services that would allow terrorists to carry out an inside job, as the bombing of the destroyer Cole seems to have been. Fifth, work closely with the host country's intelligence and police forces to limit vulnerabilities. These are pretty straightforward operating principles, but they may be ignored, either because of overconfidence in U.S. armed might (forgetting that the whole point of terrorism is to puncture that very image), or because U.S. forces overseas often want to be seen as benevolent and helpful. ``It's very, very complicated,'' said Adm. Stanley R. Arthur, who commanded allied naval forces in the 1991 Persian gulf war. ``The basic nature of Americans is that we're much more comfortable reaching out than being in a bunker mentality.'' In Lebanon, the United States trusted all factions to accept that it would be an even-handed guardian of order. In Yemen, it trusted the port authority not to be infiltrated by Islamic kamikazes, a doubtful proposition at best. ``They executed the plan as it was specified,'' Adm. Vern Clark, the chief of naval operations said of the U.S. commanders' security precautions. Today, it is clear that the plan was inadequate. What happened in Yemen is a reminder that the world abounds in dangerous places, that U.S. forces are vulnerable whenever they venture into them and that they must take precautions equal to that knowledge.

Divers searched water-filled compartments of the USS Cole on Monday and crews with powerful metal cutters tried to slice through the wreckage to reach more victims as sailors worked to stabilize their crippled warship. Conditions improved slightly for those aboard, with damaged electricity facilities restored to the point where the air conditioning could be turned on for the crew, said Lt. Terrence Dudley, spokesman for the U.S. 5th Fleet. Temperatures have been in the 90s in Aden, and the crew has been without air conditioning since the explosion Thursday that killed 17 sailors in a suspected act of terrorism. Other officials said exhausted Cole sailors were spending some time resting aboard two other Navy ships after working until dawn Sunday to keep the ship afloat when a bulkhead collapsed. Pressure variations had blasted open the bulkhead while sailors were draining areas of the ship, sending more water flooding in. Electrical shorts kept crews from using the regular pumps, so they jury-rigged a system using firefighting equipment. The crew was to receive a visit Monday from Gen. Tommy Franks, Tampa, Fla.-based commander of the U.S. Central Command. Franks was also scheduled to meet with Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh, officials said. There has been no credible claim of responsibility for the apparent suicide attack, which killed 17 sailors, wounded 39 others and punched a 40-by-40-foot hole in the hull. Yemeni security forces have detained more than a dozen people for questioning, but no arrests have been announced. As of Monday, the FBI was still having trouble getting its entire contingent of explosives experts, evidence technicians and investigators to Yemen, according to two federal law enforcement officials in Washington. These officials said about 30 FBI agents had reached Yemen and were arranging facilities in a local hotel and abroad the USS Camden to accommodate the larger group. More than 70 FBI agents remained at the U.S. Air Force base in Ramstein, Germany, awaiting a flight to Yemen, which officials hoped would be able to leave later Monday. The blast ranks as the deadliest terrorist attack on the U.S. military since the bombing of an Air Force barracks in Saudi Arabia in 1996 that killed 19. U.S. officials have suspended naval stops in Aden, where the bodies of 10 victims remained missing. Crews were trying to reach the two visible and the 10 missing, perhaps trapped behind floors and walls bent wildly by the blast. In Virginia, doctors said some the injured would soon be released to go home. On Sunday, 33 of the injured were flown from a U.S. military hospital in Germany where they received initial care to the Cole's home port, Virginia's Norfolk Naval Station. Six injured sailors remained hospitalized in Germany. Four will likely return to the United States on Tuesday or Wednesday, while the two others will stay for at least another week, Col. James Rundell, deputy director of the Landstuhl Regional Medical Center in western Germany, said Monday. Meanwhile, terrorism and explosive experts combed through scenes described by a U.S. official as ``utter devastation.'' On the deck, ``confetti size'' pieces from the wooden attack boat were collected, the official said. Among the tasks for the investigators: looking for residue that could indicate the type of explosives. One of the officials said the power of the blast suggested ``more than just TNT'' _ which could suggest a well-organized and supplied group. The officials said the blast occurred shortly after the ship was secured to two buoys to begin refueling in the harbor, which was full of pleasure boats, fishing vessels and merchant ships. Two people on the attack boat reportedly stood at attention briefly before the explosion. The blast at the waterline was close to the dining area for senior enlisted officers. Most hands were busy finishing the docking. A few minutes later, however, and the mess area would have started to fill. Immediately after the explosion, the ship began to fill with oily water from the 40-foot deep harbor. The impact wrenched open hatches and buckled parts of the deck on the 4-year-old destroyer, whose modern construction may have helped it say afloat. Power was lost and generators were used to pump out water and keep the Cole afloat. The Cole will have to be moved from Aden for major repairs. A U.S. defense official said Monday the trip could begin in as soon as a few days, and would be made on the back of a vessel known as a heavy lift ship, like a floating dry dock capable of carrying ships of up to 30,000 tons. The unloaded Cole is 8,300 tons. U.S. diplomats have insisted the Yemeni government is not suspected of any terrorists links. But security has been a key issue regarding Aden, the home base for an Islamic militant group founded by the brother of Afghan-based terrorist mastermind Osama bin Laden _ accused of links to the 1998 bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania that killed 224 people. Afghanistan's Taliban rulers denied bin Laden was involved, according to a Taliban statement published Monday in Pakistan's Urdu-language newspaper Jang. The Taliban said ``Osama cannot carry out such activities from Afghan territory.'' Bin Laden has been living in Afghanistan since 1996 when he fled Sudan. The Taliban have refused to hand him over to the United States. Bin Laden has criticized Yemen for allowing U.S. ships to refuel at Aden. The United States keeps a small port-based security contingent in Aden, but relies mostly on Yemeni authorities. Washington is eager to strengthen relations with Yemen as another foothold in the Arab world. U.S. officials dismissed questions that security risks were overshadowed by political objectives when warships began refueling in Aden in June 1999. About 25 Navy vessels have used the port.

Fidel Castro's government called for a huge street protest Wednesday against moves in the U.S. Congress it contends will strengthen rather than ease sanctions against the communist island. A bill approved by the House last week would allow Castro's government to buy food from the United States for the first time in nearly 40 years. But Havana says that because of tight restrictions on financing, as well as travel by Americans to the island, it will not spend a single cent on American food or medicine under the proposed law. Cuban officials were pleased earlier this year about growing American support for an easing of the U.S. trade embargo that was imposed in 1962 and significantly tightened the following year in an attempt to squeeze Castro's government. But they see the current congressional legislation as a definite step back. ``Our country will not buy a single cent of food or medicine from the United States,'' read an editorial published Monday on the front pages of the Communist Party daily Granma and the workers' weekly Trabajadores. ``First, for elemental reasons of ethics and dignity we cannot accept humiliating and unjust conditions that maintain intact all the laws and measures adopted as part of the cruel economic war against our people.'' ``In practice, it will be totally impossible to buy food and medicine from the United States'' under the financing restrictions, it added. The House approved the measure as part of a $78 billion spending bill. It still needs Senate approval before it goes to President Clinton, who has said he will sign it. Even the bill's most ardent supporters have acknowledged the proposed law imposes tight restrictions on financing and travel that will initially limit business between the two countries. Neither the federal government nor U.S. banks can finance the food sales, so Cuba would have to pay cash or get credit from a third country. Among Havana's biggest complaints about the bill are the tightened restrictions on U.S. travel to the island. Most U.S. citizens already are effectively barred from visiting Cuba because of spending restrictions under the trade embargo. Wednesday's march, the editorial said, will also be ``a protest for the gross violation of the constitutional rights of Americans to visit and know Cuba, where they have always been received with hospitality and respect.'' During the seven-month battle to repatriate Elian Gonzalez, the 7-year-old boy who was returned to Cuba from the United States in late June, Havana was pleased by growing support among the American people to lift the U.S. trade embargo imposed in 1962. ``It was evident that President Clinton as well as the majority of Congress and the American people were getting tired of a stupid and cruel policy,'' said the editorial. But that momentum was lost amid presidential election-year politics, it added. Castro's government also protested another congressional bill, recently approved by both houses, that will allow families of three men killed when their civilian planes were shot down by Cuban fighter jets in 1996 to receive $58 million in Cuban funds. The money will be taken from AT&AMP;T accounts frozen by the U.S. government since the 1960s.

A senior House lawmaker moved Monday to withhold proposed foreign aid to Yemen until the United States is assured the Yemeni government is cooperating in the investigation into the terrorist attack on the USS Cole. Rep. C.W. Bill Young, R-Fla., chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, said the foreign aid bill now being considered by Congress should specify that there will be no aid ``until we have assurances that they are not in any way harboring terrorists and are fully supporting the investigation.'' Young made the statement in a letter to Rep. Sonny Callahan, R-Ala., who heads the Appropriations foreign operations subcommittee. Young and Callahan, at a meeting last April with newly elected Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh, agreed to provide money for Yemen in the fiscal 2001 budget in what Young called a ``gesture of goodwill toward a new government that is moving positively toward democracy.'' Committee staffers said $4 million was included to promote democracy and education in the country. The official Yemeni news agency said Saleh had met with the head of the U.S. Central Command, Gen. Tommy Franks, to review military cooperation and had expressed ``his deep regret and sorrow for this criminal act against our country and against the United States of America.''

Israel and the Palestinians agreed Tuesday to end the street violence that has torn their region apart for more than two weeks and to get back on the path toward a permanent solution to their conflict. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said Tuesday's agreement _ the surprise conclusion to an emergency summit here _ was supposed to result in a cease-fire. ``A cease-fire should be happening within hours, immediately,'' she told CNN. Additionally, within two weeks the two sides were to meet with American mediators to explore the possibility of resuming talks, Albright said. Musing on the future in an interview with The Associated Press, Albright said it was not clear whether the two sides would do everything they could to implement the agreement and end the fighting. She paused briefly and then added firmly: ``They will have to do it.'' With that, she planned to fly to Riyadh to confer with leaders in Saudi Arabia. And President Clinton headed for Air Force One, hurrying home for his next painful mission _ attending a memorial service for the 17 sailors killed last Thursday in an apparent terrorist attack on the USS Cole in Yemen. The agreement reached here was not made public and Israeli Prime Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat left the ceremony without saying anything. Still, it was clear from Clinton's announcement that both sides made major compromises. Arafat backed away from his demand for an international fact-finding commission into the causes of the turmoil on the West Bank, in Gaza and in Israel. Barak yielded to demands that he pull back Israeli troops that have killed scores of Palestinians. In a concession, a U.S. official said Arafat agreed to rearrest the Islamic militants who were released from jail last week _ one of Israel's demands. Clinton did not use the term ``cease-fire.'' Instead, he said both sides agreed on ``immediate concrete measures'' to end the violence. ``I believe we have made real progress today,'' Clinton said. ``Repairing the damage will take time.'' Barak, speaking later, told an Israeli television station, ``The coming days will tell whether we still have a partner. Reality has to change in a significant way. The events of the last few weeks left their mark on us ... we will examine, as will the Americans, whether it is possible to renew the negotiations.'' But in the immediate aftermath of the summit announcement, Palestinian militiamen shot at homes in a Jewish neighborhood of Jerusalem and Israel responded with tank-mounted machine gun fire, but no one was hurt. Word of the truce was greeted by skepticism from both Israelis and Palestinians. In the Gaza Strip, hundreds of Palestinians threw rocks and several firebombs at an Israeli military checkpoint. Palestinian medics said 10 demonstrators were hurt, including one who was in serious condition. The Israeli army said a sniper shot and injured a firebomb thrower, but that there were no additional casualties. The Palestinian delegation went from the summit hall directly to the airport and flew back to Gaza. They made no comment to reporters in Egypt. Clinton spelled out the three elements of the agreement: _Both sides agreed to publicly call for an end to violence, eliminate points of friction, maintain calm and the recurrence of the recent uprisings. He said the United States will help with security issues, if needed. _The United States will develop with both sides and the UN a fact-finding committee to investigate the events of the past several weeks. _ The leaders agreed that the United States will consult with the parties within the next two weeks about how to move forward. ``We should have no illusions about the difficulties ahead,'' Clinton said. ``If we are going to rebuild confidence and trust we must all do our part, avoiding recrimination and moving forward. I'm counting on each of us to do everything we possibly can in the critical period ahead.'' Later, aboard Air Force One, a senior administration official, told reporters: ``They've agreed to all the steps we had hoped they would agree to. There were a lot of uncertainties here. Implementation is not going to be easy. This remains a very tense and dangerous area. It only takes one person to shoot a gun or throw a rock.'' ``Their desire to come back together and discuss the resumption of the negotiation process suggests to me that they both want to see negotiations resume,'' he added. The official said Clinton would select members of the fact-finding commission in consultation with both sides. Its task will be to investigate the sudden outbreak of violence.

Yemeni investigators found bomb-making equipment in a house near the port of Aden and believe two men who spent several days there are linked to the bombing of the USS Cole, security officials said Tuesday. The officials identified the men, who have disappeared, only as non-Yemeni Arabs. Other Yemeni officials said they were Saudi. The disclosure comes a day after Yemen reversed its earlier position and called the blast that killed 17 Americans ``a premeditated criminal act.'' The new stance gave a crucial boost to the investigation. The country's security forces interrogated dozens of port workers and others on Monday, including the head of the company that services U.S. warships. The security officials said the house was searched Monday and bomb-making materials were found. The officials did not elaborate on what the materials were. The officials said the men were believed to have entered Yemen four days before Thursday's bombing. They did not say which country the men had traveled from. There has been no credible claim of responsibility for the deadliest terrorist attack on the U.S. military since the 1996 bombing of an Air Force barracks in Saudi Arabia that killed 19. But immediate suspicion fell on terrorist mastermind Osama bin Laden _ accused in the 1998 bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania that killed 224 people. That August, the United States fired dozens of Tomahawk cruise missiles on eastern Afghanistan in an attempt to kill bin Laden. In his first statement since December 1998, bin Laden warned against another attack. He said Tuesday that an attack would not kill him and vowed to continue his battle against the ``enemies of Islam.'' He made no direct reference to the Yemen attack, but Afghanistan's Taliban rulers on Monday denied bin Laden was involved. MORE

Gov. Mel Carnahan, the Democratic candidate in one of the most hotly contested U.S. Senate races in the country, was killed when the plane shuttling him to a campaign rally crashed in rainy, foggy weather. The Cessna 335 also carrying Carnahan's 44-year-old son, Roger, who was piloting the plane, and campaign adviser Chris Sifford, 37, went down Monday night 25 miles south of St. Louis. They had been en route to a rally for Carnahan, 66, who was running against Republican Sen. John Ashcroft. There were no survivors, said Jerry Nachtigal, the governor's spokesman. Investigators from the National Transportation Safety Board were sent to the scene. ``We found wreckage in very small pieces spread over a large area. We have found some remains we cannot identify at this point,'' Jefferson County Sheriff's Capt. Ed Kemp said. Ashcroft's campaign immediately suspended all advertising and other operations. ``Obviously this is not a time for politics. This is a time for the state to come together,'' Ashcroft said. The race, seen as one of the key races in the Democrats' effort to retake control of the Senate, had been a dead heat for months. A Zogby poll taken for the St. Louis Post-Dispatch the first week of September gave Ashcroft 45 percent and Carnahan 43 percent, within the 4-point margin of error. Carnahan's name will stay on the Nov. 7 ballot because the deadline for changing it was Oct. 13, Secretary of State Bekki Cook said. Lt. Gov. Roger Wilson will serve out the remainder of Carnahan's term, until Jan. 8. If more voters cast ballots for Carnahan than Ashcroft on Nov. 7, the seat would become vacant when Ashcroft's current term ends Jan. 3, Cook said. Wilson, a Democrat, would have constitutional authority to appoint a senator to fill the vacancy through the November 2002 general election, when the seat would be up for election, Cook said. The deaths prompted discussion of whether Tuesday night's debate in St. Louis between Vice President Al Gore and Texas Gov. George W. Bush should be postponed. Tuesday morning, though, the debate's sponsors said the presidential debate would go forward. It will begin with a moment of silence and brief remarks about Carnahan. In a statement, Bush praised Carnahan as ``a thoughtful, distinguished man who was dedicated to quality education and excellence in public service.'' Gore said he was ``deeply saddened'' and hailed Carnahan's work on education and other issues. The NTSB said the twin-engine plane, a six-seater, was registered to a law firm where Roger Carnahan was a partner. The governor had been expected at the rally at 8 p.m. in New Madrid, about 125 miles south of the crash site, described as a hilly, wooded area. State Sen. Jerry Howard, who was at the rally, said Roy Temple, executive director of the Missouri Democratic Party, got a page around 8 p.m. from Sifford. Sifford told Temple the governor's plane had encountered lightning and was going to return to St. Louis or Jefferson City, Howard said. Tom Hunter, who lives near the crash site, said he heard the plane flying overhead. ``I thought, 'What a crazy person in this kind of weather.' Next thing, sounded like it was in a very steep dive, the engine was just screaming,'' Hunter told St. Louis TV station KMOV. He said he heard a loud explosion and the sky turned red. ``That was it,'' Hunter said. ``It was total silence. I told my wife to call 911.'' In Jefferson City at dawn Tuesday, Susie Shultz, a state employee, brought red mums to the governor's mansion. ``I thought he was wonderful,'' she said. ``He did so much for our state. Mel Carnahan was the education man. He was for the right things.'' Carnahan, son of a seven-term congressman, won his first public election at age 26 as a municipal judge in his hometown of Rolla. He was elected to the Missouri House of Representatives two years later and served two terms before becoming state treasurer. In 1988, Carnahan was elected lieutenant governor. Four years later, he won the governor's office in a landslide and was re-elected in 1996. He was barred by state law from seeking a third consecutive term as governor. ``Governor Carnahan always believed public service was a noble calling,'' Nachtigal said. ``We will miss him dearly.'' President Clinton called Carnahan's wife, Jean, to express condolences while he was at the Mideast summit in Egypt. The couple had four children. ``He's known him for a long time. They've worked together on a lot of issues,'' Clinton spokesman Jake Siewert said. In 1976, another Senate challenger in Missouri, U.S. Rep. Jerry Litton, died in a plane crash as he and his family were flying to a victory celebration the night he won the Democratic nomination. The last governor to die in office was Florida Gov. Lawton Chiles on Dec. 12, 1998. The 68-year-old collapsed while exercising in the governor's mansion gymnasium. South Dakota Gov. George Mickelson died in 1993 when the state's airplane slammed into a silo in eastern Iowa. ___ On the Net: Missouri State Government: http://www.gov.state.mo.us National Governors' Association: http://www.nga.org/subtocnga.htm John Ashcroft: www.johnashcroft.com Mel Carnahan: www.carnahan2000.com

The bodies of six more American sailors were recovered Tuesday from the crippled destroyer USS Cole in Yemen, and the search continued for six others believed still aboard, U.S. officials said. Pentagon spokesman Rear Adm. Craig Quigley said the identities of the six recovered remains would be released once the families had been notified. He said the Navy initially believed that seven remains had been recovered but revised that to six. In all, 17 sailors were killed in what U.S. officials believe was a terrorist suicide attack on the Cole last Thursday while it was refueling in Aden. Five bodies were recovered last week and were flown back to the United States. Two other bodies had been spotted aboard the ship last week but could not be removed due to the extreme damage caused by the bomb. In addition, there were 10 whom the Navy presumed had been killed but could not be found. The recovery of six bodies Tuesday left six others to be accounted for. The search was continuing. Over the weekend, the Navy sent a 22-member team of specialists with 10 tons of equipment to cut through the twisted steel inside the ship and find the sailors who were listed as missing. Navy officials said they knew approximately where the bodies were but could not reach them because of the extensive damage. A memorial service for victims of the bombing is scheduled Wednesday at Norfolk Naval Station, the Cole's home port in Virginia. President Clinton and Defense Secretary William Cohen plan to attend. The presumed final death count of 17 makes this the worst terrorist attack on the American military since a truck bomb ripped through a U.S. Air Force housing complex near Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, in June 1996, killing 19 troops. Quigley said the Cole remained stable in the Aden harbor, and that two additional Navy ships _ the amphibious warships USS Anchorage and the USS Duluth _ arrived Tuesday to provide more assistance for the crew of the Cole. A third ship, the amphibious assault ship USS Tarawa, is due in Aden Wednesday, he said. The Anchorage, Duluth and Tarawa are carrying a combined total of 2,100 Marines. There also are 101 Marines aboard the Cole providing security, Quigley said. Quigley also announced that the Navy signed a $4.5 million contract with the Norwegian owners of the heavy-lift ship Blue Marlin to carry the Cole back to a U.S. port after the FBI finishes its investigation aboard ship. The Blue Marlin, currently in port in Dubai on the Persian Gulf, will head for Aden on Thursday, arriving four or five days later, Quigley said. About a week later it will begin hauling the Cole back to the United States, he said.

this debate begins in the shadow of a missouri tragedy. last night, just about this time, the democratic governor of missouri died in a plane crash with his son and an aide. governor mel carnahan was running for the senate this year, and his death puts in very sharp perspective how tight the overall race for control of the senate is. here is aaron brown. the plane crash that claimed the governor's life has left my surnia state of mourning and the political establishment in a state of shock. the governor's opponent in the election, john ashcroft, suspended his campaign, a close and nasty one that will be played out to the end because carnahan's end will remain on the ballot. but the crash may have ended the decrat's slim chances of taking control of the u.s. senate on election night. they needed a good night they needed to halt some of their own seats like in new york and they really needed to pick off these vulnerable incumbents, including ashcroft. to win the senate, the democrats need to pick up five republican seats. the best chances, beating grahams in minnesota, roth in delaware, gordon in washington and taking florida where a republican is retiring. on the other hand, republicans seem certain to win a democratic seat in nevada. and may well win one in virginia as well. the odds which were never good for the democrats, have grown very long, indeed. to get the senate back now, democrats have to run the table. when every contested race. when the with the race so closhgs that's almost impossible. it may turn out that the only way they can take control of the senate is to lose the white house. then joe lieberman would remain democratic senator joe lieberman one crucial democratic seat in the closest battle for control of the senate in 40 years. aaron brown, abc news, new york. you can have another look at the senate rundown at abc.com.

back on the american political landscape, the wreckage of a small plane south of st. louis is a stunning reminder of the unexpected turns in the political fortunes of candidates and parties alike. missouri governor mel carnahan, his son and an aide were killed when the plane went down en route to a campaign stop where carnahan was to have pressed his race for the u.s. senate. nbc's robert hager tonight on the crash. the plane goes in hard, spreads wreckage over several hundred yards of woodland and takes the lives of governor carnahan, his son roger -- believed piloting -- and campaign aide chris sifford. all heading from st. louis to a campaign stop in new madrid, missouri. it appears they start to turn back because of rough weather, when they radio that the plane's onboard gyroscope has problems. shortly after, the plane disappears from radar. all of a sudden, i heardnb his engine just revving for all its worth. he was flying along and then, "err-r-r!" loud boom, big red sky, explosion, that was it, total silence. when he hit, it was just -- just everything shook. and i have a cement-reinforced house. the bed shook. everything just shook. i mean, i wasn't even sure if it had hit the house or not. that's how loud it was. the plane -- a twin-engine cessna, like this. its gyroscope, like this, operates key instruments like the altitude indicator that tells a pilot if the plane's climbing, descending or banking. without that altitude indicator, a pilot in dark and rain could lose track, tip the plane over and fall from the sky -- just what investigators believe happened to john f. kennedy jr. there are backup instruments that do not depend on the gyroscope, and instrument-rated pilots like the governor's son are trained to use them, but it's not easy. former military investigator tom farrier -- flying what's called "partial panel," with only part of your instruments working, is one of the most demanding skills that a pilot has to practice. and when you are confronted with a nighttime-in-cloud situation, it's all the more challenging. an early theory. but a challenge for investigators. ntsb's carol carmody -- the pieces are small, as small as this, in many cases. but it's those small pieces of instruments that may eventually tell investigators just what happened here. robert hager, nbc news, washington. the death of governor carnahan has political implications, obviously. his name will remain on the senate ballot. it's too late for democrats to replace him, according to state election laws. if carnahan's name gets more votes than his republican opponent, the senator ashkroft, the acting governor most analysts say that is unlikely, and carnahan's death will effectively dash any hopes the democrats had of regaining a majority in the senate this year.

the senate should vote today on a bill to allow the sale of food and medicine to cuba. it would exempt those items from unilateral u.s. embargoes. but it prohibits any u.s. financing of those sales. cuba is the target of the bill, but the exemption would also affect iran, sudan, libya and north korea. in havana, hundreds of thousands of cubans marched in protest of the bill. cuba calls it a sham and says it actually tightens sanctions, that's because the measure requires congress must approve any changes in the rules that bar americans from traveling to cuba.

Russia's aging Mir space station, unoccupied and starved for the money necessary to operate it, may be near the end of its 15-year life, experts said Wednesday. Officials of the Russian Space Agency are to meet in Moscow early Thursday to recommend that the Russian government either keep Mir in space or bring it down early next year. With little prospect of renewed financing coming in quickly enough, several experts said the agency was highly likely to decide against maintaining the station, signaling that the end of Mir was near. The experts said Russia had little choice but to take Mir from orbit soon for safety reasons, because the 130-ton station was slowly sinking toward the Earth and could harm people and property if it fell uncontrollably from space. Keeping Mir in space would require boosting it with spacecraft that the Russians can no longer afford, the experts said. ``I really don't see Mir lasting too much longer,'' said Charles Vick, an expert on the Russian space program with the Federation of American Scientists. ``The Russians don't have the money to operate it any longer and I'm not convinced that the private financing is there to do it, either.'' The Russian government, which owns Mir, stopped supporting the station last year but has leased commercial rights to MirCorp, a company in Amsterdam. MirCorp is trying to raise money to save the station for commercial ventures, and it continues to lobby hard for a reprieve. Executives of the company, which has spent more than $40 million this year on missions to Mir to keep it operating, said the battle was not over. ``There have been threats of Mir's demise before, and that is nothing new to us,'' Chirinjeev Kathuria, an important MirCorp investor and a board member, said Wednesday. The president, Jeffrey Manber, has been in Moscow for more than a week lobbying officials and others about the wisdom of keeping Mir in space, Kathuria said. ``The Russian government is slowly beginning to understand that the money will be coming,'' Kathuria added. ``And we think they will keep Mir up long enough to see that we will come through with it.'' The United States and other partners in the International Space Station have been urging Russia to stop putting its scarce resources into Mir and concentrate on its commitments to the international project.

The US State Department is warning Americans to take precautions against possible terrorist attacks in the Persian Gulf region, the Arabian Peninsula, and Turkey. NPR's Ted Clark reports. The department says it has information that terrorists might be planning operations against US interests or US citizens in these areas. No details were provided. The department urges Americans to avoid large crowds and to keep a low profile in Turkey, the Gulf, and the Arabian Peninsula. They should vary routes and times for all required travel, the department says, and treat mail from unfamiliar sources with suspicion. Tensions in the Middle East have increased sharply because of the ongoing Israeli-Palestinian clashes and last week's attack on the USS Cole. Ted Clark, NPR News, Washington.

The bodies of 2 more American sailors were recovered today from the USS Cole in the Yemeni port of Aden. US officials are on the scene and continuing their investigations into the explosion that killed 17 crewmembers on board the Cole last Thursday. Today there are reports that police in Aden questioned the landlord of an apartment where bomb-making equipment was found and whose occupants may have carried out the suicide attack against the warship. Also today at the Cole's homeport in Norfolk, Virginia, President Clinton led a memorial service for those who died aboard the Cole. The service began with the playing of the national anthem. The President asked all Americans to take a moment to thank the men and women of the military. Today we honor our finest young people, fallen soldiers who rose to freedom's challenge. We mourn their loss, celebrate their lives, and offer the love and prayers of a grateful nation to their families. Mr. Clinton mentioned the name of each of the 17 victims and praised the courage and character of the men and women who serve in the armed forces. And he delivered this clear message for those who carry out attacks on members of US military. For those who attacked them we say you will not found the safe harbour. We will find you and justice will prevail. America will not stop standing guard for peace, or freedom, or stability in the Middle East and around the world. At the end of the somber ceremony, President Clinton asked everyone to join him in a moment of silence followed by the Navy hymn Pantaps *** .

The Voice of America presents differing points of view on a wide variety of issues. Next, an editorial expressing the policies of the United States government. On October 12th the USS Cole was the target of a terrorist bomb in Yemen. 17 US sailors are reported dead and more than three dozen were injured. " We will find out who was responsible and hold them accountable," said President Bill Clinton. If their intention was to deter us from our mission of promoting peace and security in the Middle East, he added, they will fail utterly. The Cole, a guided missile destroyer was preparing to refuel at the Yemeni port of Aden, when a small boat believed to have been manned by terrorists pulled alongside the ship and exploded. The US is conducting an intensive investigation into the attack. In recent years, the US has spared no effort to track down terrorists to the far corners of the world and bring them to justice. This includes those responsible for the savage 1993 World Trade Center bombing and the man who murdered two people that same year in an attack outside the head quarters of the Central Intelligence Agency near Washington DC. In June 1998, the US arrested Mohammed Rashid for the 1982 bombing of a Pan-American airline flight from Tokyo to Honolulu that killed one passenger and wounded 15 others. Of the 17 Al Qaeda terrorists responsible for the 1998 bombings of the US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, in which more than 200 men, women and children were killed and thousands were wounded, nine have been apprehended. The US will not rest until the eight remaining fugitive terrorists including Osama Bin Laden have been brought to account. The US has been a major target of international terrorists for many years. Despite their threats and violence, US policy remains unchanged. US will make no concessions to terrorists. US will bring to justice those who attack its citizens and interests. US will hold state sponsors of terrorism fully accountable. The price of opposing international terrorism is high, but the US will continue to pay it. Not to do so would be both immoral and dangerous.

The Cold War may be over but the bombing of the USS Cole was a clear signal the United States should place greater value on its military, Dick Cheney said Wednesday. ``It's still a dangerous world out there,'' the Republican vice presidential candidate told several hundred people before observing a moment of silence for the bombing victims. His speech came the same day a ceremony was held in Norfolk, Va., where the USS Cole is based, in memory of the 17 sailors killed aboard the Navy destroyer in Yemen last week. Cheney, who was defense secretary during the Gulf War, spoke to a mix of students and older voters at St. Vincent College, a Roman Catholic school near Pittsburgh. He said voters must be aware that, by picking a president, they're also choosing a new commander in chief. ``There's no more important constitutional duty,'' he said. ``It's the power of life or death, if you will, over men and women in uniform.'' He said the Democratic ticket of Vice President Al Gore and Joseph Lieberman believes it is inappropriate to discuss the state of the armed forces during the campaign. ``There's a school of thought that we don't need robust forces out there because the bad guys have been vanquished. But the key to maintaining peace is that we may not need to be as big as we were in the Cold War, but we need to be up to the task,'' he said. Speaking about his signature issue, military readiness, Cheney again argued that the military has suffered under eight years of President Clinton and Gore. ``While it may be the best in the world, the trend is in the wrong direction,'' he said. Cheney said rebuilding fleets will take time, but poor morale can be improved almost immediately with incentives to re-enlist, better equipment and _ a new commander in chief. He echoed later themes at a later rally in nearby Montoursville. ``He just did such a great job as secretary of defense,'' said Harry Nagel, a 75-year-old retired sales manager, one of several hundred Bush-Cheney supporters who attended the rally inside a hangar at Williamsport Regional Airport. ``He doesn't need this job, he's doing it out if a sense of duty.'' Cheney also planned to attend an evening fund-raiser in Whippany, N.J.

A retired Navy admiral and a retired Army general will head an independent investigation of security on the USS Cole at the time the ship was hit by an apparent terrorist attack in the Yemeni port of Aden. The Pentagon planned to announce on Thursday that Defense Secretary William Cohen had requested the probe be led by Adm. Harold W. Gehman, who retired this summer as commander in chief of U.S. Joint Forces Command, and Gen. William Crouch, who retired in 1999 as Army deputy chief of staff, a senior defense official said Wednesday, speaking on condition of anonymity. Crouch also is a former commander of U.S. Army Europe and chief of NATO's Allied Land Forces Central Europe. In that capacity he commanded the U.S.-led NATO peacekeepers in Bosnia in 1996-97, a mission that placed a high priority on troop security, or ``force protection measures,'' in military parlance. Gehman had extensive at-sea experience during his career, including tours in Vietnam and as commander of a destroyer. He later served as vice chief of naval operations, the No. 2 post in the Navy. The investigation will examine the circumstances at the time of the Oct. 12 bombing in Aden, Yemen, and assess ways in which standard security precautions during visits to foreign ports can be improved. The probe will be independent of the FBI's ongoing investigation of who carried out the attack. U.S. officials believe that a small boat sidled up to the Cole while it was preparing to refuel in the middle of Aden's harbor and detonated a bomb powerful enough to rip a hole 40 feet high and 40 feet wide in the Cole's hull. Seventeen sailors were killed and more than 30 were injured. The impact wrenched open hatches and buckled parts of the deck on the 4-year-old destroyer, whose modern construction may have helped it say afloat. The Cole will have to be moved from Aden for major repairs by a vessel known as a heavy lift ship, which is like a floating dry dock capable of carrying ships of up to 30,000 tons. The unloaded Cole is 8,300 tons. The Navy, meanwhile, said the bodies of two more American sailors were recovered Wednesday from the Cole, and the search was to resume Thursday for the last four missing bodies believed still aboard. Over the weekend, the Navy sent a 22-member team of specialists with 10 tons of equipment to cut through the twisted steel inside the ship and find the sailors who were listed as missing. Navy officials said they knew approximately where the bodies were but could not reach them because of the extensive damage. Lt. Cmdr. Cate Mueller, a Navy spokeswoman, said the two additional remains _ along with six bodies recovered on Tuesday _ were due to arrive at Dover Air Force Base, Del., on Thursday. A port-side memorial service at Aden, the scene of the attack last Thursday, was held before the eight remains were taken aboard a plane for the flight home, Mueller said. The Pentagon released the names of two of the six bodies recovered on Tuesday. They are Ronald Scott Owens, 24, of Vero Beach, Fla., and Kevin Shawn Rux, 30, of Portland, N.D. The other four sets of remains recovered Tuesday as well as the two recovered Wednesday had not yet been identified. Five bodies were recovered last week and were flown back to the United States. The presumed final death count of 17 makes this the worst terrorist attack on the American military since a truck bomb ripped through a U.S. Air Force housing complex near Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, in June 1996, killing 19 troops.

A bill sent to President Clinton would ease the decades-old embargo on Cuba, provide $3.6 billion in aid to farmers and allow for the import of cheaper prescription drugs. The Senate on Wednesday approved the $78 billion agricultural spending bill 86-8 despite misgivings by many lawmakers about whether the Cuba and drug-import measures will do much good. Clinton has agreed to sign the legislation. The bill would allow sales of food to Cuba for the first time in about 40 years. The move is largely symbolic because the legislation bars the federal government or U.S. banks from financing the shipments. At the insistence of Cuba's critics in the House, the bill also would prevent Clinton or his successor from easing restrictions on travel to Cuba. ``We're only taking about one step forward and three steps sideways,'' said Sen. Pat Roberts, R-Kan. Even as the Senate neared a vote, hundreds of thousands of Cubans marched in Havana in protest of the legislation. The Communist Party daily Granma called the bill a ``gross lie that the genocidal blockade has been softened.'' ``The hard-liners won out on the Cuba issue,'' said Sen. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D. ``Why should farmers not have access to that market in Cuba?'' The legislation also aims to increase sales of food and medicine to Iran, Libya, North Korea and Sudan by allowing U.S. subsidies for such exports. Democrats said the bill's drug-import provision was so full of loopholes that it would save consumers little. But Sen. James Jeffords, a Vermont Republican who has championed the issue, said he thought the legislation was ``strong and workable.'' The agriculture measure was the seventh spending bill for fiscal 2001, which began Oct. 1, that Congress has completed, including three Clinton has signed into law. Three others are ready for congressional approval, while the remaining three are under negotiation between lawmakers and the White House. To keep agencies open, leaders planned to push a fourth temporary spending bill through Congress on Thursday, this one running a still undetermined number of days into next week. Leaders hope the final bills can be completed by then and Congress can adjourn for the year. The third stopgap measure expires Saturday. Meanwhile, in the GOP's long-running dispute with Clinton over overseas abortions, Republicans offered to provide $385 million for overseas family planning efforts and forbid its distribution to groups that provide abortions. That prohibition would end in March, allowing the next president to either distribute the money freely or reinstate the Reagan-era restriction. Congressional Democrats turned down the GOP offer, citing Clinton's pledge to veto a foreign aid bill if it contains the limitation. Republicans said bargaining was continuing with the White House. Among other provisions of the agriculture spending bill: _$2 billion in aid to farmers who have lost crops or pasture to drought this year. The bill also provides subsidies to honey producers, whose government price-support program was phased out in the 1990s. There also is money for growers of a variety of other commodities, including apples and cranberries _Egg farms will be tested for salmonella bacteria about once a year under a plan worked out by consumer groups, producers and government regulators. The plan will establish the first nationwide pathogen testing standards for egg producers. _As many as 900,000 additional families may qualify for food stamps because of looser eligibility restrictions aimed at signing up more low-income working families. Participation in the food stamp program has fallen by a third since 1996. The eight senators who voted against the bill included one Democrat, Russ Feingold of Wisconsin, and seven Republicans: Wayne Allard of Colorado, Phil Gramm of Texas, Jon Kyl and John McCain of Arizona, Don Nickles of Oklahoma, Bob Smith of New Hampshire and George Voinovich of Ohio. Six senators did not vote: Joseph Biden of Delaware, Dianne Feinstein of California, Rod Grams of Minnesota, Jesse Helms of North Carolina, Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts and Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut. ___ The bill is H.R.4461. On the Net: Senate Appropriations Committee: http://www.senate.gov/(tilde)appropriations

The Yemeni coastline, where the USS Cole met disaster in an apparent terrorist bombing last week, is a ``sieve'' for terrorists but was the best option available for refueling Navy ships in the volatile region, the former U.S. military commander in the region said Thursday. Gen. Anthony Zinni, who was commander in chief of U.S. Central Command at the time the Pentagon contracted for refueling services in the Yemeni port of Aden in December 1998, took responsibility for the decision. ``I pass that buck on to nobody,'' Zinni told a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing.

The Yemeni coastline, where the USS Cole met disaster in an apparent terrorist bombing last week, is a ``sieve'' for terrorists but was the best option available for refueling Navy ships in the volatile region, the former U.S. military commander in the region said Thursday. Gen. Anthony Zinni, who was commander in chief of U.S. Central Command at the time the Pentagon contracted for refueling services in the Yemeni port of Aden in December 1998, took responsibility for the decision. ``I pass that buck on to nobody,'' Zinni told a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing. Zinni, who retired earlier this year, said he and the rest of the American government were well aware that terrorists use Yemen as a transit route into Saudi Arabia. ``Their coast is a sieve,'' he said. Yet there were no better alternatives and Navy ships must refuel in that area while moving to and from the Persian Gulf, Zinni said. The port of Djibouti, on the Horn of Africa and just across the Gulf of Aden from Yemen, had been used but the refueling contract there was terminated in about 1997 because the facilities were unsatisfactory and ``the threat conditions were far worse.'' That left him with ``options that were not very good,'' Zinni said. The retired general told the committee that he personally checked on the refueling arrangements in a series of visits to Aden between May 1998 and May 2000. Each time, Zinni said, it was clear to him that the Yemeni government was sincere in wanting American help in controlling its coastline. Zinni said his chief of security also visited Aden in May 1998 to check on security arrangements. Zinni said Aden was one of the few ports in the region where U.S. intelligence had not detected specific threats to American interests. The threat conditions in Yemen, he said, ``were actually better than we had elsewhere,'' including Saudi Arabia.

Anthony Zinni, who was commander in chief of U.S. Central Command at the time the Pentagon contracted for refueling services in the Yemeni port of Aden in December 1998, took responsibility for the decision. ``I pass that buck on to nobody,'' Zinni told a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing. Zinni, who retired earlier this year, said he and the rest of the American government were well aware that terrorists use Yemen as a transit route into Saudi Arabia. ``Their coast is a sieve,'' he said. Yet there were no better alternatives and Navy ships must refuel in that area while moving to and from the Persian Gulf, Zinni said. The port of Djibouti, on the Horn of Africa and just across the Gulf of Aden from Yemen, had been used but the refueling contract there was terminated in about 1997 because the facilities were unsatisfactory and ``the threat conditions were far worse.'' That left him with ``options that were not very good,'' Zinni said. The retired general told the committee that he personally checked on the refueling arrangements in a series of visits to Aden between May 1998 and May 2000. Each time, Zinni said, it was clear to him that the Yemeni government was sincere in wanting American help in controlling its coastline. Zinni said his chief of security also visited Aden in May 1998 to check on security arrangements. Zinni said Aden was one of the few ports in the region where U.S. intelligence had not detected specific threats to American interests. The threat conditions in Yemen, he said, ``were actually better than we had elsewhere,'' including Saudi Arabia. While the Senate committee began to examine the circumstances behind the Navy's use of Aden as a refueling stop, the Pentagon was preparing to move ahead with its own investigation. A retired Navy admiral, Harold W. Gehman, and a retired Army general, William Crouch, will head an independent investigation of security practices on the USS Cole at the time the ship was hit by an apparent terrorist attack Oct. 12. Meantime, the commander of the Atlantic Fleet, Adm. Robert Natter, said Thursday he is very confident that those responsible for the attack will be found, and he added that they must be punished. ``We have got to go and attack the enemy.'' ``There has been an attack on U.S. sovereign territory _ that U.S. Navy warship. That's sovereign territory,'' Natter said on NBC's ``Today.'' ``If we are going to defend ourselves, we have got to go on the attack. ``You cannot continue to allow yourself to be attacked and attempt to defend yourself without at some point saying 'this is inappropriate,''' Natter said. The Pentagon planned to announce on Thursday that Defense Secretary William Cohen had requested the probe be led by Gehman, who retired this summer as commander in chief of U.S. Joint Forces Command, and Crouch, who retired in 1999 as Army deputy chief of staff, a senior defense official said Wednesday, speaking on condition of anonymity. Crouch also is a former commander of U.S. Army Europe and chief of NATO's Allied Land Forces Central Europe. In that capacity he commanded the U.S.-led NATO peacekeepers in Bosnia in 1996-97, a mission that placed a high priority on troop security, or ``force protection measures,'' in military parlance. Gehman had extensive at-sea experience during his career, including tours in Vietnam and as commander of a destroyer. He later served as vice chief of naval operations, the No. 2 post in the Navy. The investigation will examine the circumstances at the time of the Oct. 12 bombing in Aden, Yemen, and assess ways in which standard security precautions during visits to foreign ports can be improved. Natter, the fleet commander, said: ``To my knowledge, I'm very pleased with what the ship was doing with respect to self-defense.'' But he declined to say whether he has seen evidence of a security lapse, saying that is the purpose of the investigation. The probe will be independent of the FBI's ongoing investigation of who carried out the attack. U.S. officials believe that a small boat sidled up to the Cole while it was preparing to refuel in the middle of Aden's harbor and detonated a bomb powerful enough to rip a hole 40 feet high and 40 feet wide in the Cole's hull. Seventeen sailors were killed and more than 30 were injured. The impact wrenched open hatches and buckled parts of the deck on the 4-year-old destroyer, whose modern construction may have helped it say afloat. The Cole will have to be moved from Aden for major repairs by a vessel known as a heavy lift ship, which is like a floating dry dock capable of carrying ships of up to 30,000 tons. The unloaded Cole is 8,300 tons. The Navy, meanwhile, said the bodies of two more American sailors were recovered Wednesday from the Cole, and the search was to resume Thursday for the last four missing bodies believed still aboard. Over the weekend, the Navy sent a 22-member team of specialists with 10 tons of equipment to cut through the twisted steel inside the ship and find the sailors who were listed as missing. Navy officials said they knew approximately where the bodies were but could not reach them because of the extensive damage. Lt. Cmdr. Cate Mueller, a Navy spokeswoman, said the two additional remains _ along with six bodies recovered on Tuesday _ were due to arrive at Dover Air Force Base, Del., on Thursday. A port-side memorial service at Aden, the scene of the attack last Thursday, was held before the eight remains were taken aboard a plane for the flight home, Mueller said. The Pentagon released the names of two of the six bodies recovered on Tuesday. They are Ronald Scott Owens, 24, of Vero Beach, Fla., and Kevin Shawn Rux, 30, of Portland, N.D. The other four sets of remains recovered Tuesday as well as the two recovered Wednesday had not yet been identified. Five bodies were recovered last week and were flown back to the United States. The presumed final death count of 17 makes this the worst terrorist attack on the American military since a truck bomb ripped through a U.S. Air Force housing complex near Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, in June 1996, killing 19 troops.

The Yemeni coastline, where an apparent terrorist bombing of the USS Cole last week killed 17 sailors, is a ``sieve'' for terrorists, the former U.S. military commander in the Persian Gulf region said Thursday. But it was the best option available for refueling Navy ships, he said. Gen. Anthony Zinni, who was commander in chief of U.S. Central Command at the time the Pentagon contracted for refueling services in the Yemeni port of Aden in December 1998, took responsibility for the decision. ``I pass that buck on to nobody,'' he told a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing. Meanwhile, the search for trapped bodies aboard the Cole yielded one set of remains Thursday, leaving three still to be found. At a Washington news conference, Attorney General Janet Reno said the United States is doing all it can to help the Yemeni police in their investigation. She would not say whether any eventual prosecution might take place in Yemen. The United States apparently has no arrangements with Yemen to extradite suspects, but could still seek to prosecute anyone arrested for involvement in the bombing. Zinni, who retired earlier this year, said he and the rest of the American government were well aware that terrorists use Yemen as a transit route into Saudi Arabia. ``Their coast is a sieve,'' he said. Yet there were no better alternatives and Navy ships must refuel in that area while moving to and from the Persian Gulf, Zinni said.

This is The World, I am Lisa Mullins. The Yemeni coastline is a sear for terrorists, but it was the best option available for refueling ships. That's what General Anthony Zinni told the Senate Arms Services Committee hearing today. Zinny was in charge of the US Central Command at the time of the Pentagon contracted for refueling services in the Yemeni port of Aden in December of 1998. Today he took full responsibility for that decision saying I pass that buck on to nobody. In Yemen officials say they now have a description of one of the suicide bombers and that mounting evidence suggests that the plot to bomb the USS Cole may have originated in a remote corner of Yemen. The World's Katy Clark has the latest on the investigation. Yemeni security officials today said that during a search earlier this week of an Aden apartment that turned out bomb making equipment, investigators also found documents they believe originated in the eastern Yemeni province of Hydra Mount. The region is home to several tribal groups that have been known to kidnap foreigners for ransom. Security officials also linked documents found in the vehicle believed to be used by the attackers to the region. Today Yemeni investigators went to the province of Hydra Mount hoping to identify the two men who used the apartment. They haven't been seen since the bombing a week ago. FBI director, Louis Freeh visited Yemen today to view the investigation first hand. After meeting with Yemen's President Free told a news conference that the FBI's role there is strictly supports. The investigation is being run by the Yemeni police and security authorities. We are the junior partner. We are very pleased with the progress of the investigation. In fact I complimented the President for the very good investigative work they have done, particularly in finding several locations which we feel may be relevant to the case. The FBI director also toured the wreckage of the USS Cole and described it as a tangled mass of metal and wire. Free said that the situation on board is a recovery mission as much as it is a crime scene. When asked who he suspected was behind the attack, Free cautioned it's still too soon to draw conclusions. We don't want to be speculating. What we want to be doing now is investigating and that's what we do, though we do it best if we do it based on the facts. Facts, which appear to be growing clearer with each day. Speaking on Arabic Satellite Television yesterday President Ali Abdullah Saleh said investigators have found a workshop they believe was used to build the engine for the boat that transported the explosives out to the Cole. They have also interviewed eye witnesses and put together a composite sketch of one of the suicide bombers. The Yemeni President said he has a beard and wears glasses but we don't know the description of the other person. The question here is, are they Yemeni nationals? The documents show they are from Hydra Mount. President Sallah described the attack as an octopus of an operation and said it was clear it had been carefully planned. Closer to home, the Senate Arms Services Community today began an examination of the policy that allowed the Cole to dock in Yemen. The Pentagon will be staging its own independent investigation into circumstances surrounding the bombing and today named retired navy Admiral Harold Geeman and retired Army General William Crouch to lead that probe. For the World I am Katy Clark.

Britain said today that it is normalizing relations with North Korea. British Prime Minister Tony Blair called the decision a historic breakthrough. It comes just days ahead of Secretary of State Madeleine Albright's trip to the North Korean capital Pyongyang. Britain's foreign minister Robin Cook, who made the announcement, said opening diplomatic links could help ease tensions between North and South Korea, technically the two countries are still at war. Germany said today that it also plans to normalize relations with Pyongyang, Celic Harrison is a Korean affairs specialist at the Century Foundation in Washington DC. Mr. Harrison, Britain, Italy, prior to that Australia, the Philippines now and apparently Germany all bringing the most secretive state into the fold. How about the United States, where does that leave us? Well, I think President Clinton will get some good political cover. From what Britain has done, if he goes to Pyongyang, as is now being discussed, Secretary Albright is going to go, the number two man in North Korea was in Washington last week. Things are moving, what's particularly important is that Britain has not attached any conditions. The United States has imposed a number of conditions on normalizing with North Korea. The most important of them is that it renounce its missile program and its nuclear weapons program, or rather reach agreements on limiting and possibly ending them both, and as of now we are not in a position to normalize relations with North Korea just like that. We will want negotiations on some of these contested issues. Well let me ask you more about America's interest now and Britain's move, I mean how do you make sense of what's happening, especially if Britain was involved in a war with North Korea as obviously was the United States, and until recently North Korea was considered by the US a rogue nation. It is still shrouded in secrecy, as we said, including in its nuclear weapons program. Are you trusting of these newly forced alliances, do you consider what Britain is doing either reckless or ill advanced? No. And I don't think it is an alliance really, it is just conducting diplomatic interchange with them. It is not even clear how soon Britain is going to have a mission in Pyongyang. And so I think it certainly isn't reckless to establish diplomatic relations, and I think indeed it is a very healthy thing because the present leadership of Kim Jong Il, son of the late General You , he has been trying to open up to the outside world. He doesn't want to reform his internal economic system or political controls. On the other hand he needs western capital, he needs supportive international agencies to deal with tremendous economic problems that North Korea has had since the end of the cold war, when they lost their Russian and Chinese economic subsidies. So that trend of North Korea opening up to the outside, it seems to be, it should be encouraged. So then as North Korea opens up more and more, what are the possible repercussions down the road for the nearly 40,000 American troops who remain in South Korea? Well, North Korea's attitude has been that if the United States and North Korea are friends and the North Koreans don't feel threatened, they wont object to some US forces remaining in the Korean peninsula in a new role. That is to say, if they are going to be there as allies of South Korea against North Korea, then the North Koreans don't want them there, they will keep putting on the pressure for the US to get the forces out. The North Koreans are certainly not going to end their missile program, if the US continues to maintain some aspects of its military presence in the Korean peninsula such as its aircraft. So I think they are going to ask for military concessions in order to do what we want them to do regarding missiles, but I think that the assumption that this improvement in ties between North and South and between North Korea and other countries is going to lead to the complete withdrawal of the US from Korea in the near future, certainly I don't think at all, are. Mr. Harrison, thank you very much for speaking with us. Thank you. Celic Harrison is a Korean affairs specialist at the Century Foundation, speaking to us from Washington DC.

American warships visited the Yemeni port of Aden two dozen times even though there had been no security reviews of local harbor workers and Yemen's coast was known to be susceptible to infiltration by terrorists, defense and administration officials said Thursday. Intelligence analysts with the U.S. Central Command did review overall security for ships visiting Yemen, but neither the American Embassy nor the Pentagon's Defense Logistics Agency required or conducted extensive vetting of Yemeni port workers, the officials said. Investigators in Yemen have not yet determined how a small harbor boat packed with explosives managed to cripple the destroyer Cole a week ago, but officials in Washington are questioning whether security lapses may have given the attackers an opportunity to strike. What, if any, lapses occurred will be the focus of an independent investigation that the Pentagon announced Thursday would be led by two former commanders, Adm. Harold W. Gehman and Gen. William Crouch. The apparent lack of scrutiny of port workers and the overall assessment of the port's safety will be among the questions they investigate, the officials said. The Cole entered Aden operating under standard procedures based on the level of threat in that port, and would have done the same in any port in the world where the threat was deemed comparable. ``It would not be different from any other port where the threat condition was the same, depending on where they were tying up,'' a senior military official said Thursday. Since the Cole's actions were standard, any findings of security shortcomings could lead to sweeping changes for American ships visiting ports around the world, not just Aden. ``I want to stress that we've said many times we will never have a perfect defense against terrorism,'' said the Pentagon's spokesman, Kenneth H. Bacon. ``But we need to make our defenses as good as they can be. And this panel is designed to help do that.'' The decision to use Aden as a refueling stop for American warships headed for the Persian Gulf was the subject of an extensive and at times charged debate at a hearing of the Senate's Armed Services Committee Thursday. Gen. Anthony C. Zinni, who retired as commander of American forces in the region in August, took responsibility for the decision to use Yemen for refueling stops, but defended them, saying Aden was safer and more strategically located than other ports he considered. At the same time, he acknowledged the risks from terrorism given that Yemen had little control over its borders and its port at Aden _ and the people who came and went through them. ``Their coast is porous,'' he said. ``It's a sieve, as are their land borders.'' The committee's Republican chairman, Sen. John W. Warner of Virginia, underscored the point when he disclosed that Louis Freeh, the director of the FBI, who visited Aden Thursday, had told him that suspects identified by Yemeni authorities ``had been in and out of Yemen but just for a brief period.'' Several senators questioned whether the United States had ignored what Sen. Pat Roberts, R-Kan., called ``red flags'' about the safety and security of the port at Aden, in part out of desire to enhance diplomatic ties to Yemen. ``We know there will be risks around this world and we have to be engaged around this world,'' said Sen. Jeff Sessions of Alabama, another Republican. ``But did we take more risk than we needed to in this instance?'' American warships began using the refueling station in Aden in March 1999 after negotiating a contract with a local contractor, the Arab Investment Manufacturing and Trading Co. Since then 24 ships have refueled there, officials said. Under its contract with a division of the Defense Logistics Agency, the company was required to provide security for its fueling facilities _ mainly, a Pentagon official said, to ensure the fuel was not tainted. The company was also responsible for the harbor boats used in mooring. None of its employees, however, were subjected to background checks or other security reviews _ something one Navy official suggested was not feasible in a place like Yemen. Officials declined to describe the extent to which such checks were routine at other foreign ports where Navy ships refuel. Since the boat that attacked the Cole appeared to have infiltrated the flotilla of boats assisting it as it docked, the company has become a focus of the investigation, a senior administration official said. The American Embassy in Yemen negotiated a separate contract with another company, the Al Mansoob Commercial Group, which served as a ``husbanding agent'' responsible for providing food and other supplies to visiting ships. Since the Cole's visit to Aden last week had not been publicly announced, investigators suspect that workers or officials in the port would have been among those who knew of its arrival and thus may have been involved in planning the attack.

Slow, steady drumbeats announced Missouri's final farewell for Mel Carnahan, the governor who died while seeking Harry Truman's former U.S. Senate seat. Mourners by the thousands _ President Bill Clinton and first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton among them _ marched solemnly around the Missouri Capitol, leading to emotional ceremonies unprecedented in state history. ``Missourians, we have not come here today to bury our leader, but to remember him,'' said the Rev. Emanuel Cleaver, the former Kansas City mayor and close friend of Carnahan. ``We have not come here to canonize our governor, but rather to rededicate ourselves to state-building.'' Cleaver declared: ``The name Carnahan will remain precious in our memory.'' Then he led several thousand mourners standing under bright blue skies in the Lord's Prayer. A riderless black horse with its stirrups turned backward joined the processional from the Governor's Mansion to the Capitol grounds. Carnahan's widow, Jean, linked hands with her sons Russ and Tom, daughter Robin, daughter-in-law Debra and grandsons Austin and Andrew. The family led the processional's slow steps. Behind the family were the Clintons, Vice President Al Gore and his wife, Tipper, and new Gov. Roger Wilson and his wife, Pat. The procession halted at 11:11 a.m. on the south side of the Capitol. As the St. Louis Symphony String Quartet played ``Danny Boy,'' the casket was moved by an honor guard from the caisson to a marble platform. Many spectators sobbed and wiped tears as they watched. ``This week has been one of the most painful weeks in the history of Missouri,'' former Sen. Tom Eagleton said in his eulogy. ``We have lost a man whose qualities are increasingly rare in public life.'' Eagleton also eulogized the other two victims of Monday night's crash: the governor's oldest son, Roger, and long-time Carnahan adviser Chris Sifford. The three were headed to a campaign event when the aircraft went down in rain and fog near St. Louis shortly after takeoff. Carnahan had been battling Republican Sen. John Ashcroft in one of the nation's tightest Senate races. Carnahan's name will stay on the Nov. 7 ballot because the deadline to change it has passed. If Carnahan receives the most votes, Wilson can appoint a replacement to serve until the next general election, in November 2002. Investigators with the National Transportation Safety Board are trying to determine what caused the crash. Officials said that among other factors, they were looking into possible problems with an indicator that helps maintain level flight. The investigation could take up to a year, NTSB member Carol Carmody said. On Thursday, Carnahan's casket, draped in an American flag, was viewed by an estimated 8,000 mourners who filed quietly through the Governor's Mansion. Among the mourners were Jim and Mary Magers, retired state workers from Jefferson City. After stopping at the casket, they signed a guest book and wiped away tears. ``He was the best governor, just the best,'' Jim Magers said. ___ On the Net: Governor's office: http://www.gov.state.mo.us

The Navy has changed its account of the attack on the USS Cole in Yemen. Officials now say the ship was hit nearly two hours after it had docked. Initially the Navy said the explosion occurred while several boats were helping the ship to tie up. The change raises new questions about how the attackers were able to get past the Navy security.

The Navy has revised its timetable of the events leading to the bombing of the USS Cole in Yemen, raising new questions about how the attackers foiled Navy security. The Navy said Friday the explosion occurred nearly two hours after the Cole was moored to a fuel dock, not during the mooring operation, as it had said before. That would mean the boat believed to have detonated the explosives did not blend in with a flotilla of harbor craft to mask the attack, as the Navy had said. It is now less clear than before how the attacking boat could have approached the Cole without raising suspicion. The Oct. 12 attack killed 17 U.S. sailors and injured 39. The last four bodies recovered from the Cole on Thursday were prepared Friday to be flown back to the United States from Bahrain. The remains of eight other Cole victims were due to arrive at Dover Air Force Base, Del., on Friday to be prepared for burial. Among the first set of five remains sent home last week was Craig Wibberley, a 19-year-old Maryland native. A wake and visitation were held Friday for Wibberley in Hagerstown, Md. He will be buried Saturday. In a brief statement Friday, the Navy's Office of Information said earlier Navy statements now known to be erroneous were based on initial reports from the ship that were either wrong or were misunderstood by Pentagon officials. The Navy said it now has obtained additional information from the Cole's records that change at least three points of fact in the official timeline. _The explosion occurred at 11:18 a.m. local time (4:18 a.m. EDT), or about an hour earlier than originally reported. _Refueling began at 10:30 a.m. and was ongoing at the time of the attack. Before, the Navy had said refueling had not yet begun. _The Cole was completely tied up at the fueling dock in Aden harbor at 9:30 a.m., nearly two hours before the attack. The Navy previously had said the mooring operation was completed just minutes before. This last point is of particular significance to investigators because it would seem to undercut the theory previously advanced by Navy officials that the small boat seen sidling up to the Cole at the time of the explosion used the mooring operation _ involving several harbor workboats _ as a means of masking its attack. Navy officials had said the attacking boat did not raise suspicions because it appeared to be part of the mooring operation, in which small harbor boats take the ship's lines to secure it to the floating dock. The Navy has said the Cole and its crew were at the second-highest level of alert observed in the Fifth Fleet, of which the Cole was a part at that time. Crew members would have been assigned to watch through binoculars for boats approaching the Cole, and others keeping watch would have been armed with weapons. Cmdr. Greg Smith, a Navy spokesman at the Pentagon, said the revised timeline was established this week by using more precise information from the Cole's records, information collected in response to an inquiry by the Navy Times newspaper, a nongovernment publication. The Navy Times said an unidentified source associated with the port of Aden told it the Navy's original timeline was incorrect. On the day of the attack, Adm. Vern Clark, the chief of naval operations, told a Pentagon news conference the explosion happened at 12:15 p.m. local time, that the Cole had just finished being tied up at the fuel dock and that the refueling had not yet begun. He also said this information was based on initial reports from the scene and that he could not be sure it was ''100 percent accurate.'' Pentagon and State Department officials canceled planned appearances Friday before a closed-door session of the Senate Armed Services Committee. The committee heard Thursday from retired Marine Corps Gen. Anthony Zinni, who said he made the decision to refuel at Aden, largely because there was no good alternative. The administration told the committee Friday it needed more time to prepare for the hearing, said committee chairman Sen. John Warner, R-Va. Asked if Aden should have been used for refueling Navy ships, Warner said, ``I don't think any of us has had sufficient facts to reach any conclusions.'' ___ On the Net: Navy: http://www.navy.mil

The US navy has issued a revised timetable of events leading to last week's deadly bombing of the destroyer USS Cole in the Yemeni port of Aden. VOA Pentagon correspondent Alex Belida reports, the new timeline raises new questions about how the apparent terrorist attack was carried out. The navy now says the blast occurred nearly two hours after the destroyer had moored for refueling in Aden Harbor, not during the mooring operation itself. Originally navy officials said a small boat that assisted in securing the ship's lines or whose movements were masked by the mooring operation pulled aside the Cole and blew-up in an apparent suicide attack. A navy spokesman, Commander Greg Smith offers no new explanation of the circumstances leading to the blast, saying that is now a matter for criminal investigators. However, Commander Smith says, the navy remains firm in its assessment that the explosion was the result of a terrorist attack and not a refueling accident, even though the new time table confirms refueling was underway. That raises questions about how a single boat could have approached without raising the suspicions of armed guards posted as part of the heightened alert status required for the Cole's port visit.

VOA was subject to a flurry of press attention this week, it had to do with this editorial broadcast Thursday on the Voice of America. On October 12th the USS Cole was the target of a terrorist bomb in Yemen. Seventeen US sailors are reported dead and more than three dozen were injured. "We will find out who was responsible and hold them accountable", said President Bill Clinton. An unidentified US State Department employee at first refused to clear the editorial because it did not mention the more than 100 Palestinians who have died in recent Middle East violence. VOA correspondent Nick Semion filed this story on Wednesday. The issue involves the preparation of a VOA editorial in which the US government vowed to bring to justice those responsible for last week's bombing of the navy destroyer, the USS Cole in Yemen. A State Department official involved in approving the editorial for broadcast sent a memo to VOA suggesting any mention of the deaths of the Americans needed to recognize as well the deaths of more than 100 Palestinians in violence in the Israeli occupied territories. The memo leaked to reporters said the editorial would not be approved for broadcast unless a reference to the Palestinian deaths was included. At the State Department Wednesday, Spokesman Phil Recur said the note sent to VOA was wrong and called the whole incident a mistake. Once we became aware of this error, we in fact went back and checked and the editorial in question was cleared and VOA was notified of that yesterday. VOA spokesman, Joel O'Connell says he does not know where the idea of comparing the deaths of Americans aboard the USS Cole to the deaths of Palestinians came from, but that VOA did not change its editorial to include it. In its broadcast, Voice of America must follow a charter written into law that requires it to be accurate, objective, and comprehensive in its reporting. The charter also requires VOA to present the official policies of the United States, which is done in editorial form, not prepared by VOA journalists, and clearly labeled as being separate from the news product. Nick Semion, VOA News at the State Department. Nick Semion mentioned the separation between the reporting an editorial functions at VOA. Many VOA staff members are dismayed by this recent publicity because it gives the impression that all VOA content is whetted by the State Department. Actually the only content on VOA that requires State Department clearance is the editorials, which are written by the International Broadcasting Bureau's Office of Policy. Some Americans who protested the original non-clearance of the editorial accused the State Department of censorship, but as the announcer says before each editorial, these are statements... Expressing the policies of the United States government. And thus it is understood that editorials heard on VOA are subject to revision and occasional rejection by the State Department. The Office of Policy submits 10 editorials per week to the State Department, about one or two are sent back for revision, it is rare for any editorial to be killed. The rejection of the Cole editorial happened at Tuesday, the rejection memo was leaked to the press and by 8 p.m. Washington Time, Tuesday the incident was reported by journalist Bill Crystal and Matt Drudge. The State Department sent a fax clearing the editorial at 11:30 p.m Tuesday. I have links to much of the news coverage of this story including an image of the memo rejecting the editorial and the transcript of the State Department news conference on the script for today's program at the Communications World website. That memo, by the way, looks like something that might have been prepared during World War II on a manual typewriter.

In the moments before it exploded, tearing a ragged hole in the destroyer Cole moored in Yemen, a white motorized skiff circled around the ship's bow and slowly skirted along its portside. Two men aboard the skiff nonchalantly waved to armed sailors standing watch on the Cole's deck, and the sailors waved back, officials said on Friday, in a new account of the attack. That account said the the small boat was not part of a flotilla helping the Cole moor to a refueling station in Aden on the morning of Oct. 12, contradicting initial Pentagon reports that its involvement in harbor operations enabled the attackers to avoid suspicion, and raising new questions about security on deck. In fact, the Cole was already moored and taking on fuel _ with many of its crew members relieved from duty on deck _ when the skiff approached, according to senior officials who have pieced together an account of the events that morning. Even so, the skiff's presence did not raise alarms among the sailors on watch. The crew was used to seeing curious boaters come up for a closer look whenever the Cole, one of the world's most advanced warships, sailed into port anywhere. At least some of those aboard assumed it must have been part of the mooring flotilla even though that operation had concluded, these officials said. At 11:18 a.m. local time, or 4:18 a.m. Eastern time, the skiff reached the midpoint of the Cole, pulled within a few feet of the hull and, with the two men aboard standing up, exploded with the force of 500 pounds of explosives that had been ``shaped'' to concentrate the blast directly into the destroyer. ``It came around the side and came up in a slow manner,'' a senior government official who has reviewed witnesses' accounts said on Friday. ``The guys in the boat waved at the Cole. There was nothing unusual; it was the way other boats have approached in port. They went putt-putt-putt along the side and then lit up.'' Eight days after the attack on the Cole killed 17 sailors, this clearer and significantly revised account of the incident is beginning to emerge, according to administration officials, Navy commanders and some of those aboard the Cole that day. Now that the last of those killed have been removed from the Cole, the new details have thrown a spotlight on the security precautions aboard the destroyer. They are also affecting the direction of the investigation, pointing to a strike that, one official said, could not have been carried out by known Yemeni terrorist cells without significant support from outside Yemen. American investigators have completed a series of field tests on residue found on the Cole, and one of the tests showed evidence of C-4, a powerful plastic explosive, two officials here said. However, the investigators do not believe the preliminary tests are conclusive and have brought samples to the United States for further analysis, they added. Plastic explosives like C-4 are expensive and relatively difficult for terrorist groups to obtain, suggesting the attackers in this case had extensive financial and operational support. The Navy announced Friday that in the initial confusion and overriding concern for the lost and wounded sailors, its commanders had misstated some of the details of the Cole's activities on the day of the attack. The Cole had in fact arrived in the port earlier in the morning, thrown its first mooring line over by 8:50 a.m. and completed mooring by 9:30. About 10:30 it began refueling and had been doing so for nearly 40 minutes when the skiff exploded at 11:18 _ an hour earlier than initially reported. The revised timing is significant because it contradicts first reports that the attackers were involved in the mooring operation, or had at least cleverly infiltrated it and, having thus blended in, did not appear suspicious. In fact, the small fiberglass skiff, packed with explosives, was not supposed to be that close to the Cole at that time and yet still raised no alarms, the officials said, raising questions about the crew's security procedures as the destroyer was refueling in a port considered dangerous, if not an overtly hostile. A senior Navy official said the ship's captain, Cmdr. Kirk S. Lippold, had reported by telephone to commanders in the region in the hours after the attack that the crew believed the skiff had been involved in mooring operation, suggesting the mooring was still under way. ``Now the question will be, why did they think that?'' the official said. In addition to the criminal investigation in Yemen, the Navy and the Department of Defense have begun their own inquiries into what happened and questions about the security procedures aboard the Cole and in the port will be a primary focus, officials have said. The sequence of events outlined by officials on Friday supports initial eyewitness accounts _ reported immediately after the blast _ that the skiff had approached the Cole alone and unchallenged, not as part of the mooring operation. That also supports reports by Yemeni authorities that the skiff had been launched from a trailer beneath a bridge in Little Aden, about six miles from where the Cole moored to the refueling station. However, Yemeni officials have repeatedly said the boat seen launched that morning was a rubber dingy, while American officials say the boat carrying the bomb was made of fiberglass. Navy officials argued that the new details did not change the fundamental facts of the case, saying the Cole's sailors had no reason to suspect the skiff and could have done little to stop it. ``If a boat doesn't speed in and come right at you, how do you determine hostile intent?'' a senior officer said. The unthreatening behavior of the two men _ and the fact that the skiff was not unlike other boats plying the harbor _ evidently put the Cole's guards at ease. Still, the skiff raised enough concern by its actions that, according to the officials, the sailors aboard closely tracked it as it made its way and watched as the two men stood moments before the blast. American warships entering any port _ especially one, like Aden, that is considered potentially dangerous _ have clear security guidelines. In this case, the officials said, the Cole was operating under a heightened state of alert, known as threat condition bravo, that required sailors armed with rifles and wearing body armor to watch all boats approaching the ship. Seaman Raymond Mooney, one of the 39 sailors injured and evacuated to the United States, said in an interview from the Naval Medical Center in Portsmouth, Va., on Monday that the Cole's crew was not supposed to allow boats to get too close to their ship in port. Often they did, though, waving friendly greetings. ``They were doing it when we stopped in France,'' he said. As for Aden, he added, ``It was a friendly port.''

Rana Musawi, schoolwork in one hand and sunglasses tucked into a T-shirt pocket, is not your typical Arab protester. But powerful images of Palestinian children gunned down by Israeli soldiers have spurred ordinary people like her to take to the streets _ and have forced Arab leaders meeting Saturday to consider the mounting anger across the Arab world. ``This is to show that we have feelings, that we feel for the Palestinians and have sympathy for them,'' Musawi, a 21-year-old university student who joined some 3,000 Lebanese and Palestinians here Thursday in burning flags and denouncing Israel and the United States. In the era of live television, footage of stone-throwings and shootings are bringing the Israeli-Palestinian conflict to Arabs' living rooms and moving them to act as never before. In particular, Mohammed al-Dura, the 12-year-old whose killing in the Gaza Strip was captured on camera, has become a symbol of the conflict for Arabs around the world. Footage of the boy huddled in his father's arms as both cowered on a street corner amid a hail of bullets Sept. 30 aroused Arab anger at what many saw as excessive use of force by Israel. When a Palestinian mob killed two Israeli reserve officers last week, Arabs watched live as Israel retaliated by firing rockets on Palestinian neighborhoods. They were able to flip between CNN and Al-Jazeera, a popular Qatari all-news satellite station that broadcasts across the region. Lebanon's LBC and Future as well as Al-Manar TV of the anti-Israeli guerrilla group Hezbollah broadcast similar dramatic images. Even Syria's autocratic government has looked the other way as satellite dishes, ostensibly banned, sprout on rooftops in its larger cities. The Internet also has played a role as a forum for discussion and organization. Across the Arab world, protests drew hardcore activists who believe in the cause _ spanning the spectrum from leftists to Muslim fundamentalists _ and individuals who simply felt they had to do something. In Cairo, Arab leaders are meeting Saturday to consider a stance on the violence that has rocked the peace process. Egypt and others were trying to find a balance between the anger and the recognition that the peace process is the only way forward. ``We have to translate our feelings as Arab citizens to our official responsibility,'' Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa said. ``In the end, I think it will meet with all the hopes of the Arabs _ if they are within the realm of reason and possibility and if the measures taken are subtle and necessary.'' Noisy, small-scale protests in Jordan and Egypt, which have peace treaties with Israel, have at times have turned violent. Protesters turned out for rallies in Syria and Lebanon, where there are 700,000 Palestinian refugees whose movement is restricted, and even in Gulf states where demonstrations are rare. In Cairo, Egypt, protesters blasted their government's inaction, chanting: ``Where is the Egyptian army?'' Despite instituting a ban after riots two weeks ago left one dead and scores injured, authorities in Jordan tolerated protests. Anti-peace campaigners have long agitated for abrogation of Jordan's 1994 peace treaty with Israel. In Lebanon, Palestinians _ usually kept under tight control in the refugee camps _ were allowed to demonstrate. Some took their anger to the border, where they hurled stones and firebombs at Israeli soldiers, who shot back and killed two protesters. The government has since kept the Palestinians away from the border. In the Gulf, one satellite TV station raised $22 million in a one-day telethon last week to help Palestinians. In Yemen, where a terrorist attack earlier this month is suspected of crippling the USS Cole and killing American 17 sailors aboard, President Ali Abdullah Saleh described crowds as ``excited, stirred up and discontented'' over Palestinians' plight. ``Let the people express themselves. Let the Arab nation hear our voice and the (Palestinian) citizen in the occupied territories knows that he has a brother, sister who supports him and feels the pain with him,'' he told Al-Jazeera. Among the protesters in Beirut, Lebanon, was Kirsten Scheid of Cleveland. She marched quietly along Corniche Mazraa, one of the city's main streets, to protest her country's support for Israel. ``I am fulfilling what I think is my duty,'' she Scheid, who is married to a Lebanese.

With flames and smoke filling a glitzy Mexico City nightclub, terrified patrons fled for the sole exit _ only to find guards barring the way to some, demanding they first pay their bills, survivors said. The blaze killed 20 people, and injured two dozen more. The Lobohombo club was still packed at 5 a.m. when the blaze started Friday. ``Please! It's burning! Open the door!'' Sara Falcon said she and others pleaded to the guards who stopped them asking for tickets proving they'd paid. ``Everyone was shouting,'' she told TV Azteca news, wiping away tears. ``Many people were on fire, yelling and throwing themselves on the floor. Others were yelling, 'Open the door because people are burning!''' Witnesses said patrons panicked when smoke began filling the disco, and began scrambling to escape out the club's only exit. The building had no emergency exits, authorities said. It took 90 minutes to put out the blaze. The Lobohombo with its mirrored facade, was one of the best known nightclubs in North America's largest city. Gloria Estefan held a party there in August and salsa superstar Willie Colon had performed there. Hours after the tragedy, hundreds milled outside the charred building, its mirrors shattered and blackened with smoke. Its trademark, a sign featuring the face of a cartoon dog, was gone. Police said a short circuit in the sound booth may have sparked the blaze, but firefighters said witnesses reported hearing several explosions. Officials put the death toll at 20. Falcon's aunt, Lorena Falcon Perez, said her 16-year-old daughter was trapped in the flames, and later carried out of the building as chunks of burning wood fell to the ground. She suffered third-degree burns and was in critical condition at a local hospital. ``When the doctors told me about my daughter, I fainted,'' Falcon Perez said. ``It's not right what those (owners of the disco) did. A place that has events like this should at least be safe.'' Authorities said the club had a long history of legal problems, repeatedly clashing in court with the city. Lobohombo was operating with a permit for a restaurant rather than a nightclub, authorities said. Its 4,700 square feet surpassed the maximum size permitted by law. The club had a capacity for more than 1,000 people, but at times held up to 3,000. Authorities shut the club down 11 times for code violations but the owners managed to negotiate its reopening each time, said Dolores Padierna, a local neighborhood representative. Earlier this year, officials ordered the club closed because it lacked a permit for table dancing. The disco had featured female dancers. The owner secured a federal court injunction allowing it to stay open, said local official Maria Inez Munoz. An attorney for the club's owner, Alejandro Iglesias Rebollo, disputed the allegations that officials had tried to close down the club. City officials inspected and approved the club in June, attorney Victor Trejo Sanchez told the Radio Red network. The Iglesias family owns more than 80 nightclubs in the city. Authorities said many have been cited for violations. A month ago, authorities closed their bar La Luna after discovering drugs were being sold there. A few months before that, police arrested a group of women for dancing naked at one of their other bars, Hawaii. According to the National Association of Discos and Bars, 15,000 establishments are in violation of the minimum operating norms in Mexico. Violations range from closing long after the set hours of operation to allowing prostitution and drugs.

the u.s. navy is revising the timeline of last week's attack on the "uss cole." it says the explosion happened more than two hours after the ship was tied to a fuel dock, not during the mooring operation, as previously thought. some wonder then, how the terrorists' boat could have escaped notice, since there should have been no other boats near the "cole." the navy says the sailors may have thought the small boat was there to help free the "cole" from lines tying it to the fuel dock. officials in yemen say they found bombmaking materials at a nearby apartment. fbi agents in yemen have taken swabs of explosive residue found in the apartment, and have sent them to washington for analysis.

Long processions of cars, plastered with candidates' posters and with horns blaring, paraded through this coastal city Saturday, one day before presidential elections to end 10 months of military rule. The display of vehicles, with shouting supporters hanging out windows, marked some of the liveliest political activity since the campaign period began two weeks ago. Campaigning in Ivory Coast, once famed as an oasis of stability amid the unrest that plagues much of West Africa, has been muted. Most candidates _ including those from the country's two largest political parties _ were excluded from the vote by the Supreme Court. Junta leader Gen. Robert Guei, who took control during a December coup promising he would quickly give up power, and who has close personal ties to the chief justice of the Supreme Court, is widely expected to win. ``The elections are already done and people here are not interested,'' said Ali Ouattara, a journalist in the northern city of Korhogo, where a few torn and defaced posters were the only sign of the approaching vote. While there are a total of five candidates, the only other serious contender is Laurent Gbagbo, a history professor and longtime opposition leader. The country's best-known opposition candidate, Alassane Dramane Ouattara, was excluded by the court because of what it said were questions about whether both his parents were of ``Ivorian origin,'' as a new junta-backed constitution requires. Ouattara's party, the Rally of the Republicans, and the former ruling Democratic Party of the Ivory Coast, whose candidates were also excluded, have both called for a boycott of the polls. Representatives of Rally of the Republicans set out on motorbikes Saturday to urge villagers in the party's northern stronghold not to cast ballots. ``Stay in your homes, play soccer, or till the fields, but don't vote,'' party representative Lacina Coulibaly told about 30 youths gathered in the northern village of Lanviara, near Korhogo. Guei took control during the Dec. 24 coup promising he would quickly give up power, but has since exchanged his military uniform for a snappy suit and rallied several smaller parties around his candidacy. The United Nations, the Organization of African Unity, the European Union and countries such as the United States and Canada have withdrawn election observers or funding to protest Guei's decision to run and the exclusion of major opponents. Ivory Coast's reputation as a haven for stability and relative wealth has been badly tarnished in recent years. Its economy has been hobbled by a steep decline in prices for its primary exports, cocoa and coffee, while the December coup and two subsequent military mutinies have frightened Ivorians and foreign investors alike.

A team of Russian and Norwegian divers on Saturday entered the waters where the Kursk nuclear submarine sank, and sliced two holes in the outer hull, officials said. The divers arrived at the site Friday, after months of planning, and immediately began preparations for recovering the bodies of the 118 sailors inside the submarine, Navy spokesman Capt. Igor Dygalo said. ``Around 1 a.m. in the morning Moscow time, divers started submerging with the aim of inspecting and preparing the hull of the submarine for cutting openings,'' Dygalo said. By late afternoon Saturday, the divers had cut two holes in the hull's outer layer above the submarine's rear two compartments, navy spokesman Vadim Serga said. He said cutting into the thicker inner hull would probably take place Tuesday and last 15 hours. The rear of the ship is less damaged than the front, which suffered an explosion and hit the sea floor first in the Aug. 12 accident. Capt. Vladimir Navrotsky, the northern fleet's chief spokesman, told a briefing in the port city of Murmansk that the divers could be ready to cut through the hull's inner layer by Sunday night. He said four Russian and two Norwegian divers were working in teams to carry out the operation. Birger Haraldseid, a spokesman for the Norwegian subsidiary of Halliburton, the Dallas-based oil services company, said from Norway that the dive was on schedule and there were no problems so far. ``The divers have bled off the pressure of some high pressure pipes to ensure they are neutralized,'' he said. ``This is an important safety measure.'' The divers sailed Friday from the Norwegian port of Hammerfest on the mother ship Regalia. They found calm seas in the Barents Sea area where the Kursk exploded and sank on Aug. 12, and the weather in the region Saturday was good, Haraldseid said. However, meteorologists have warned that the seas could grow rough next week, complicating the salvage effort. Dygalo said, ``the practical preparatory stage pursues the aim of creating all the necessary conditions for the penetration of the compartments of the submarine Kursk.'' Russian Deputy Prime Minister Ilya Klebanov said on Friday that it would take until Monday to conclude preparations for the actual recovery. ``The operation will likely start Tuesday or Wednesday,'' Klebanov said. Halliburton is working with Russia's Rubin military design bureau to organize the recovery, in which divers would cut holes in the submarine's double hull to pull bodies or body parts out into the ocean to bring to the surface. All 118 seamen on board the Kursk died when the submarine exploded and sank during naval exercises in the Barents Sea. Russian officials have not determined the cause of the accident. They are considering an internal malfunction, a collision with a Western submarine or collision with a World War II-era mine.

Despite authorities' focus on two suspects, the investigation into last week's bombing of an American warship in this port is still in its beginning stages, the U.S. ambassador to Yemen said Saturday. Ambassador Barbara Bodine said the cooperation from the Yemeni side has been ``excellent.'' Yemen has detained some 60 people for questioning in the Oct. 12 bombing of the USS Cole. Nonetheless, ``we are a long way from reaching a conclusion,'' Bodine said. ``There is a whole range of evidence and leads that will be pursued fully.'' Officials believe two suicide bombers maneuvered a small boat packed with explosives next to the Cole, which was refueling here, and then detonated it, killing 17 U.S. sailors and injuring 39. Authorities have been focusing on two men who rented an Aden apartment where bomb-making material was later found. Bodine said Saturday that the timing of the incident will play a crucial role in the investigation. She did not elaborate further. The bombing happened an hour after the ship arrived at the port for refueling. Security has been beefed up citywide since the bombing, with hundreds of armed soldiers and undercover agents patrolling Aden's streets. On Saturday, the Cole rested in calm waters near the port, where undercover officers made their rounds. Half a dozen armed military personnel in blue camouflage fatigues manned a bridge where local fishermen had docked their small boats. In another part of the city, Yemeni police stood guard in front of the house where the suspected bombers stayed and left bomb-making material. The iron gate in front of the house was padlocked. At a news conference on Thursday, FBI director Louis Freeh complimented Yemeni authorities' work in the case and said his agency has a ``junior'' role in the investigation. But the U.S. presence in Aden is unmistakable. Several U.S. ships float in the harbor, military helicopters hover overhead, and Marines patrol the city. Poet Mohammad Noman al-Sharjani, 56, said Yemenis in general are not happy with the United States because of what is seen as its support of Israel. A crowd of 1 million demonstrated Saturday in the capital, San'a, protesting against Israel, the United States and Arab leaders regarded as too soft on Israel. Despite such sentiments, al-Sharjani said Aden residents don't mind the U.S. presence in this case. Airport security guard Nabil al-Nizali agreed. ``They're doing their job and we're doing our job,'' he said. ``They had soldiers killed here and they need to investigate that.''

In a landmark visit that signals an accelerating thaw in United States relations with North Korea, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright will leave Sunday night to meet with the Communist leader, Kim Jong Il, and to pave the way for a trip by President Clinton. Albright will be the most senior American official to visit the tightly controlled Stalinist state and Clinton would be the first American president to go to North Korea since the Korean War began more than 50 years ago. The hasty arrangements for Albright's trip _ made in less than 10 days for a visit that would normally take months to choreograph _ were another signal of the Clinton administration's desire to push ahead with improving relations before Clinton leaves office. But the prospect of Clinton's making such an important foreign visit so late in his presidency to a state the United States has charged with supporting terrorism has raised mixed reactions from experts on the region and a heated discussion even within his own administration. The usually reclusive North Korean leader made a surprising debut on the world stage earlier this year, holding a first-ever summit meeting with a South Korean president, Kim Dae-jung, during which they made some progress in warming relations but left a raft of issues unresolved. Albright will be talking to the North Korean president about how far his country is prepared to go in shutting down its missile program and missile exports to countries hostile to the United States, senior administration officials said. North Korea's missile program has raised anxiety throughout the region, particularly in Japan, and was cited as one of the main reasons for the ambitious proposals in the United States to build a national missile defense system. Other issues on the table will be North Korea's support of terrorism and how to reduce military tensions between North and South Korea, where the United States still maintains some 37,000 troops along a heavily militarized border that Clinton himself described at the start of his presidency as the ``scariest place on earth.'' The sudden decision for Albright to travel to North Korea follows a visit earlier this month to the White House by Vice Marshal Jo Myong Rok, a senior North Korean military official, who issued an invitation for Clinton to go to Pyongyang, the North Korean capital. But the Pentagon is less enthusiastic about a presidential visit. Last month it released a report with a pessimistic assessment about North Korea's military intentions, saying North Korea showed no fundamental change in its posture. The report said North Korea had stockpiled chemical weapons and continued to develop its short-and long-range missiles, though it had honored its pledge to American negotiators last year that it would not flight-test them. The White House is clearly leaning toward going ahead with a Clinton visit. ``Tell me why I shouldn't go,'' will be Albright's mission on behalf of the president, a senior official said. The official said Albright would be seeking to ``evaluate'' whether the North Koreans would be prepared to move forward on the issues if President Clinton does in fact go. ``For North Korea, the president's visit is itself the prize,'' said Arnold Kanter, a former under secretary of state in the Bush administration. ``The question is what the United States is getting in return that meets our needs to reduce the threat posed by North Korea.'' As under secretary in 1992, Kanter was the first high-level American official to meet with a senior North Korean official. Another critique came from Michel Oksenberg, a China expert who served on the National Security Council during the Carter presidency. He said the stakes were too high to rush into a visit with a lame duck president. ``A presidential trip has to be exquisitely planned and time is very short,'' Oksenberg said. But administration officials have defended a possible Clinton visit, saying they asked advice _ and got the approval _ from the South Korean president before going ahead with Albright's trip. They also make the case that the trip is part of a slow process of negotiations with the North, which have already borne fruit with the North's agreement last year to temporarily freeze flight tests of their missiles, which has been extended indefinitely. Last month, the North also stockpiled the last of the spent fuel rods from its nuclear reactors, officials said, a move the United States has wanted to help ensure that the fuel would not be used to produce plutonium for nuclear weapons. And one of Albright's missions, they say, will be to further explore an idea raised in talks Kim had this summer with the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, when Kim said he would reduce the long-range missile program in exchange for foreign countries launching North Korean satellites. Negotiations over the North's support of terrorism are close to bearing results as well, administration official argue. North Korea remains on the State Department's list of countries that support terrorism, a position that bars it from entering any of the international financial institutions, including the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. But the North Koreans have begun to make the required steps that could soon remove them from the terrorist list, the officials said. Albright's visit comes on the heels of a series of moves by North Korea to crack open the door to a society long closed and allow the outside world a peek inside, maneuvers that have begun to produce some benefits for Kim. Britain announced this week that it would recognize North Korea, and starting late last year, several Western countries, including Italy and Australia, took up North Korea's invitation to open diplomatic relations. Still, most experts view the moves by the North Korean leader as a way of ensuring the survival of his government, which rules over one of the world's most impoverished and constrained populations.

An Arab summit called to confront a frightening and deadly upsurge in Israeli-Palestinian violence ended Sunday with a declaration that Arab countries may consider cutting ties with Israel, but did not call on them to do so. ``Arab leaders assert in the light of the collapse of the peace process their commitment to standing up to Israeli attempts to infiltrate the Arab world under any name and to the halting of establishing any relations with Israel,'' said the final declaration, read by Arab League Secretary-General Esmat Abdel-Meguid. The declaration, read live on national television, went on to say the Arabs would hold Israel responsible for the cancellation of relations. The carefully worded statement addressed what emerged as the most contentious issue before the leaders meeting in Cairo: Whether ties several have with the Jewish state should be reconsidered. Libya had walked out Saturday, the first day of the two-day summit, saying it was frustrated that the leaders gathered would not clearly call for an end to ties with Israel. Only Egypt and Jordan have diplomatic relations with Israel. Oman, which along with Qatar had lower level ties, suspended relations on Oct. 12, closing Israel's trade mission in Muscat, the capital, and withdrawing its trade envoy from Tel Aviv. Libya had said cutting such ties was the least Arabs could do in response to more than three weeks of Israeli-Palestinian violence that have left 117 dead and more than 2,000 wounded _ the vast majority Palestinian.

The declaration, read live on national television, went on to say the Arabs would hold Israel responsible for the cancellation of relations. The carefully worded statement addressed what emerged as the most contentious issue before the leaders meeting in Cairo: Whether ties several have with the Jewish state should be reconsidered. Libya had walked out Saturday, the first day of the two-day summit, saying it was frustrated that the leaders gathered would not clearly call for an end to ties with Israel. Only Egypt and Jordan have diplomatic relations with Israel. Oman, which along with Qatar had lower level ties, suspended relations on Oct. 12, closing Israel's trade mission in Muscat, the capital, and withdrawing its trade envoy from Tel Aviv. Libya had said cutting such ties was the least Arabs could do in response to more than three weeks of Israeli-Palestinian violence that have left 117 dead and more than 2,000 wounded _ the vast majority Palestinian. While the summit was unified in holding Israel solely to blame for the violence and for bringing the peace process to an impasse, moderates warned against doing anything that might make future negotiations difficult. Egypt and Jordan insist negotiations are the only way to bring lasting peace to the region. Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak had opened the summit with an acknowledgment of Arabs' anger, but warned against ``surrendering to our emotions.'' Mubarak also called on Israel to prove that it, too, wanted peace. But among ordinary Arabs, the outcome was likely to fuel criticism already being heard: that Arab leaders are divided and unwilling to confront Israel. The summit was declared a failure in a scathing front-page editorial Sunday in Lebanon's Ad-Diyar by the newspaper's editor and publisher, Charles Ayyoub. ``How can the summit succeed while the majority of Arab rulers have accepted the restrictions of agreements with Israel and the restrictions of subservience to America?'' Ayyoub wrote. ``The Arab world needs freedom and democracy.'' Summit speeches were broadcast live throughout the Arab world. Among those who watched was Fayrouz Mohamed al-Sayed, a university student who helps out at her father's grocery store in Cairo. ``The Libyans were right to leave _ a statement or a condemnation is not going to change anything,'' al-Sayed said Saturday, pointing to a small TV behind the counter replaying a summit speech by Morocco's King Mohammed VI. ``I know a war would be hard to win, but if we are going to die then we should die with pride.'' But even Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat appeared to take a moderate tone, saying, ``Our choice is the choice of permanent, just and comprehensive peace.'' Even so, Israeli government spokesman Nachman Shai called the overall tone of Arafat's speech ``very extreme.'' The first Arab summit in four years followed the collapse of a cease-fire Mubarak and President Clinton helped broker this week at Egypt's Sharm el-Sheik resort. Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak said he would call an open-ended ``time-out'' after the Arab summit to rethink Israel's peace policy. Israel was watching the summit closely for signs of how the Palestinians might proceed once they receive the backing of fellow Arabs. Also Sunday, Arab foreign ministers signed a pledge to hold annual summits, starting with a meeting presided over by Jordan in March. The Arab League has been unable to hold regular summits since its members split over Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait. In all 16 heads of state, including the acting head of state of Saudi Arabia, attended, representing: Algeria, Bahrain, Comoros, Djibouti, Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco, the Palestinian territories, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, Tunisia and Yemen. The remaining six Arab League members _ Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, Mauritania, Oman and the United Arab Emirates _ were represented by deputies of their heads of state.

An Arab summit called to confront a frightening and deadly upsurge in Israeli-Palestinian violence ended Sunday with a declaration that Arabs may consider cutting ties with Israel, but did not call on them to do so. Among ordinary Arabs, the outcome was likely to fuel criticism already being heard: that Arab leaders are divided and unwilling to confront Israel. The first Arab summit in four years followed the collapse of a cease-fire Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and President Clinton helped broker last week at Egypt's Sharm el-Sheik resort. A carefully worded final summit declaration addressed what had emerged as the most contentious issue before the leaders meeting in Cairo: Whether ties several have with the Jewish state should be reconsidered. Libya had walked out Saturday, the first day of the two-day summit, saying it was frustrated that the gathering would not clearly call for an end to ties with Israel. Arabs ``hold Israel responsible for any steps taken in regard to relations with Israel by Arab countries, including their cancelation,'' said the final declaration, read by Arab League Secretary-General Esmat Abdel-Meguid to a live television audience across the region. At a news conference, Abdel-Meguid said Tunisia cut its low-level ties with Israel, closing its liaison office in Israel and asking for the closure of a similar Israeli office in Tunis. Tunisia's Foreign Affairs ministry said late Saturday the decision was made in light of ``the dangerous escalation ... of Israeli aggression against the Palestinian people.'' Tunisia and Israel opened economic interest offices in 1996, one of the lowest forms of diplomatic representation. Oman severed its low-level relations Oct. 12, closing Israel's trade mission in Muscat, the capital, and withdrawing its trade envoy from Tel Aviv. Referring to establishing new ties, the summit declaration said: ``Arab leaders assert in the light of the collapse of the peace process their commitment to standing up to Israeli attempts to infiltrate the Arab world under any name and to the halting of establishing any relations with Israel.'' Egypt and Jordan have diplomatic relations with Israel. Mauritania, a west African nation that is a member of the Arab League, opened diplomatic relations with Israel in January. Qatar has low-level ties. In Israel on Sunday, Prime Minister Ehud Barak told his Cabinet that Israel should take a ``time-out'' to reassess the peace process, putting on hold years of negotiations with the Palestinians. The Israelis and Palestinians both blame each other for instigating the violence. Israeli government spokesman Nachman Shai said that ``if the moderate line succeeded in this summit, I believe that there's a lot to talk about. ... Even taking a time-out does not mean that Israel is withdrawing from the peace process.'' Shai accused Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat of trying and failing to persuade Egypt and Jordan, the only Arab nations with peace treaties with Israel, to cut their ties with Israel. Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa said Egypt and others had not yet had time to consider whether they would end or reduce ties with Israel. Libya had said cutting such ties was the least Arabs could do in response to more than three weeks of Israeli-Palestinian violence that have left some 120 dead _ the vast majority Palestinian. While the Arab summit was unified in holding Israel solely to blame for the violence and for bringing the peace process to an impasse, moderates warned against doing anything that might make future negotiations difficult. Egypt and Jordan, the only Arab countries with peace treaties with Israel, insist negotiations are the only way to bring lasting peace to the region. Arafat said Saturday: ``Our choice is the choice of permanent, just and comprehensive peace.'' The summit also called on the United Nations to investigate the causes of the violence, a rejection of a similar U.S.-led committee called for at the recent Israeli-Palestinian summit in Egypt. The Arabs said an international court similar to the Rwandan and Yugoslav war crimes tribunals should be formed to try ``those responsible for the violence.'' The summit declaration asked the United Nations to consider forming an international force to protect Palestinians living under Israeli occupation. Mubarak had opened the summit with an acknowledgment of Arabs' anger, but warned against ``surrendering to our emotions.'' Mubarak also called on Israel to prove that it, too, wanted peace. In all 16 heads of state, including the acting head of state of Saudi Arabia, attended, representing: Algeria, Bahrain, Comoros, Djibouti, Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco, the Palestinian territories, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, Tunisia and Yemen. The remaining six Arab League members _ Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, Mauritania, Oman and the United Arab Emirates _ were represented by deputies of their heads of state.

Russian and Norwegian divers have removed a rubber coating between the inner and outer hulls of the sunken nuclear submarine Kursk as deteriorating weather Sunday threatened to curtail the operation to recover the bodies of the 118 sailors inside. A thick fog, rain and high winds have strongly limited visibility at the site, and a cold front was forecast for late Sunday, raising the possibility of gale force winds that could complicate the work of divers, Russian navy spokesman Vadim Serga said. The divers, working through the night, successfully removed the industrial rubber coating between the inner and outer hulls, Capt. Vladimir Navrotsky, the northern fleet's chief spokesman, said. The rubber was designed to muffle sounds from inside the submarine to make it harder to detect, and was apparently sturdier than the divers expected. Following the removal of the rubber, divers cut a four-inch hole in the thicker inner hull leading to the submarine's stern compartment number 8, Navrotsky said. He said the divers were cutting and removing pipes and obstructions in the six-foot space between the hulls that could tear diving suits. He said work on enlarging the opening could begin by late Monday. Navrotsky said the weather was steadily getting worse, but that the divers would continue working unless the winds reached light gale force. On Saturday, the divers carefully pried off two small sections of the outer hull, the first step in the planned recovery operation in which holes would be cut through both hulls to pull bodies or body parts out into the ocean to bring to the surface. The divers arrived at the site in the Barents Sea on Friday night _ more than two months after the accident that destroyed the Kursk _ and began the round-the-clock recovery operation. The operation is concentrated outside the submarine's rear two compartments. The rear was less damaged than the front end, which suffered an explosion and hit the sea floor first in the Aug. 12 accident. The ship lies 330 feet below the surface. Serga said cutting into the thicker inner hull probably wouldn't be completed until Tuesday. All 118 seamen on board the Kursk died when the submarine exploded and sank during naval exercises in the Barents Sea. Russian officials have not determined the cause of the accident. They are considering an internal malfunction, a collision with a Western submarine or collision with a World War II-era mine.

Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak told his Cabinet on Sunday that Israel needed a ``time-out'' to reassess the tattered peace process, a move that would put on hold years of negotiations with the Palestinians. After more than three weeks of violence that has left nearly 120 dead, Barak said there was little hope for progress toward a comprehensive political settlement, though that has been his top priority since his election last year. ``We need to have a time-out whose goal is to reassess the peace process in light of the events of the last few weeks,'' Barak told the weekly Cabinet meeting. ``Israel will continue to pursue peace and every path that leads to it, but one would have to be blind to security and political needs to continue as if nothing has changed.'' The statement issued by Barak's office did not say when the time-out would begin or how long it might last. The prime minister was expected to elaborate at a news conference Sunday afternoon. There was no immediate Palestinian reaction to Barak's announcement. In renewed unrest, a 14-year-old Palestinian boy was shot and killed Sunday in the Gaza Strip during a clash at the Erez crossing with Israel, hospital doctors said. Also, stone-throwing clashes were reported in several chronic trouble spots in the West Bank. On Saturday, skirmishes between Israeli soldiers and Palestinians militants left four Palestinians dead and more than 100 injured. Meanwhile, an Arab summit in Cairo, Egypt, ended Sunday with a declaration that Arab states may consider cutting ties with Israel, but did not insist that they do so. Israel, which closely watched the summit, praised the host, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, for ensuring that the Arab leaders took a ``balanced approach.'' But a prominent Palestinian spokeswoman, Hanan Ashrawi, sharply criticized the Arab leaders, saying the summit declaration was ``a whimper and not a bang'' that fell way below the expectations of the Palestinian people. ``Israel has wreaked havoc on the region, has destabilized the whole region,'' she said. The moderate Arab stance ``will only make the Arab people more disgruntled with their own leadership.'' In his statement, Barak noted that peace talks have been suspended in the past, only to be relaunched when the political atmosphere calms down. He said he expected the same result this time, but gave no indication of when that might be. Before Barak's announcement, several Israeli Cabinet members said they opposed suspending the peace process. ``A time-out will lead nowhere,'' Transportation Minister Amon Lipkin-Shahak told the Israeli newspaper Yediot Ahronot. Justice Minister Yossi Beilin said such a move would damage Israel's international standing. With the peace process on hold, Barak said he would attempt to shore up his shaky government by establishing a ``national emergency government.'' He has been attempting to persuade Ariel Sharon, leader of the right-wing Likud opposition party, to join his minority government. Sharon previously rejected the idea of joining the government, but said on Sunday it was a possibility if Barak slowed down the peace process. Sharon, speaking on Israel radio, said he could support a unity government that aimed for ``a different peace process that will lead to a long-term interim agreement that will keep strategic points in our hands.'' If Sharon and his Likud party join Barak, it could prevent the Israeli government from crumbling, and save Barak from facing early elections. However, Sharon is widely reviled by the Palestinians, and his presence in the government would hamper efforts to revive peace negotiations. In response to the current crisis, the Israeli government has also been making an assessment on a ``unilateral separation'' from the Palestinians. In such a scenario, Israel would unilaterally draw a fortified border with the Palestinians without waiting for a peace agreement. Since the violence erupted at the end of September, the Israelis and Palestinians have not held negotiations on a political settlement, though they have met in an effort to stop the current fighting. Several cease-fires have been declared, but none has taken hold, and each new round of clashes prompts bitter recriminations and calls for vengeance. Just three months ago, Israelis and Palestinians were closer than ever to a comprehensive settlement when they held intensive negotiations overseen by President Clinton at Camp David, Md. But they failed to reach a breakthrough, and the latest violence is the worst since the two sides launched regular negotiations seven years ago.

With the seas around them increasingly rough, Russian and Norwegian divers on Sunday pierced the inner hull of the sunken Kursk nuclear submarine in a laborious, precarious bid to recover the bodies of 118 sailors inside. Winds above the Arctic site mounted throughout the day and were expected to pick up overnight, threatening to curtail the operation. Working nonstop in teams since Friday, the divers carved into the outer hull Saturday, the first step in the planned recovery operation. The divers hope to cut seven holes through both hulls of the submarine to retrieve bodies or body parts from their tomb in the Barents Sea. After some struggle overnight, the divers sliced through the sturdy rubber layer between the hulls, said Capt. Vladimir Navrotsky, chief spokesman for the Russian Navy's northern fleet. Later Sunday, they cut a four-inch hole in the steel of the inner hull leading to compartment No. 8, in the rear of the submarine, Navrotsky said. Throughout the day they gradually enlarged the hole a few millimeters at a time. Russian navy spokesman Vadim Serga said cutting into the two-inch inner hull could be completed by Tuesday. The divers also were dismantling and removing pipes, wires and other equipment in the six-foot space between the hulls that could tear diving suits. The operation was focused outside the submarine's rear end, less damaged than the front, which suffered explosions and hit the sea floor first in the Aug. 12 accident. Top Russian military officials have warned that safety concerns _ including fears about the Kursk's two nuclear reactors, and threats to divers from jagged metal debris inside the wreck _ might force the Navy to call off the complex underwater work 330 feet below the surface. Radiation levels at the site, monitored by Norwegian experts, were reported normal Sunday. Navrotsky said the weather was steadily getting worse, but that the divers would continue working unless the winds reached light gale force. Russian officials have not determined what caused the accident that destroyed the Kursk during naval exercises in which all 118 seamen on board died. Possible causes include an internal malfunction or a collision with a Western submarine or World War II-era mine.

With most candidates barred, the two largest parties boycotting and a military ruler seeking to entrench his power as a civilian, residents of this West African nation trickled to polling stations Sunday to elect a new president. The voting came ten months after an army coup brought a junta to power, sparking a series of political crises and leaving this nation's reputation for political tranquility in shreds. Junta leader Gen. Robert Guei faces serious competition from just one of his four opponents in the controversial vote: history professor and longtime opposition leader Laurent Gbagbo. Most candidates, including those from the country's two largest political parties, were disqualified last month by the Supreme Court. The United Nations, the Organization of African Unity, the European Union and countries such as the United States and Canada have withdrawn election observers or funding, saying the exclusion of major opponents have made a truly free and fair election impossible. While national figures were not yet available, voting appeared light at polling stations in a number of Ivorian cities, with most reporting less than 30 percent turnout. Voters were nearly nonexistent in many parts of Korhogo, the main city in the north and a stronghold of support for the now-disqualified opposition leader, Alassane Dramane Ouattara. ``As you can see, the north is sleeping through this election,'' polling worker Drissa Dialo said at one empty voting station. Ouattara's Rally of the Republicans (RDR) and the former ruling Democratic Party of the Ivory Coast (PDCI), whose candidates were also excluded by the court, have both called for a boycott of the polls. The chief justice of the Supreme Court has close ties to Guei, who had insisted in December that he would quickly cede power to a civilian. ``The general came to sweep the house (clean), but he didn't leave, he didn't keep his promise,'' said Bema Coulibaly, a Korhogo resident who said he wouldn't be voting Sunday. Campaigning has been muted in Ivory Coast, the world's largest cocoa producer. Guei (pronounced GAY-ee), whose own soldiers have staged two mutinies since the coup and who, officials say, survived an assassination attempt in September, has barely appeared in public, apparently fearful of his security. But while he has thrown the weight of the junta behind his election, Guei has insisted he will step down if he loses. ``Ivory Coast is a country of peace, where everything takes place in serenity,'' he said Sunday after voting amid heavy security at a primary school near his house, in an upscale Abidjan neighborhood. Guei has seen his popularity wane since the December coup, when cheering crowds filled the streets of some neighborhoods to welcome the ouster of President Henri Konan Bedie, who was widely seen as corrupt and ethnically divisive. But for some Ivorians, Guei is still seen as the only candidate who can control Ivory Coast's politically divided and often-thuggish security forces. ``Without him, there would have been civil war,'' said Nicodeme Zan, a voter in Abidjan. Gbagbo (pronounced BAHG-bo), for his part, said he believed most of Ivory Coast's 5.5 million registered voters would oppose Guei, who for many remains a soldier _ albeit one who now sports a suit and tie. ``In Ivory Coast's present state, I find it unlikely that they will vote in a military man to head the government,'' he said just before casting his ballot. Many of his supporters are already referring to Gbagbo as ``president,'' and some have warned they will take to the streets if he is not declared the winner. ``The soldiers have done their job now and they must go back to the barracks,'' said Jean-Pierre Nassoue, 35, who writes for a true-crime magazine. ``It doesn't matter who wins, just not a soldier.'' Polling stations started closing at 6 p.m., with some staying open later to compensate for delays getting started in the morning. International observers reported minor irregularities, including missing voting materials and confusion over electoral procedures, but attributed the problems to ``disorder not malice,'' said an official for the European Union, which had about 30 observers stationed across the country. ``Once you swallow the big swallow, which is that there are only five candidates ... things haven't gone too badly,'' the official said on condition of anonymity. Ouattara, the country's best-known opposition candidate, was excluded after the Supreme Court said there were questions over whether both his parents were of ``Ivorian origin,'' as a new junta-backed constitution requires. The past year has seen Ivory Coast suffer through a series of crises, including the two military mutinies and a further erosion of the country's economy, already battered by a steep decline in prices for its primary exports, cocoa and coffee. The instability has frightened Ivorians and foreign investors alike.

good evening. i'm carole simpson. today, israeli's prime minister said he would take a time out from peacekeeping. he called it a timeout. president clinton responded with a phone call urging the leader to get the derailed peace process back on track. tonight, in some of the worst fighting yet, israeli gun ships attacked a village outside of jerusalem. this is what a timeout in the israeli/palestinian peace process looks like. among today's dead, two palestinians were killed in clashes in gaza, one of them just 14 years old. there were persistent and prolonged gun fights in the west bank city of ramallah, where they were burying another 14-year-old, kied in fighting yesterday. at their emergency summit in cairo, arab leaders placed the blame for this crisis solely on israel. that much they could agree on. but a push to have all arab governments break off diplomatic ties with israel was blocked by moderate states, including egypt and jordan, which have peace treaties with israel. i'm not surprised that israel is pleased with the results of this summit, because the clear message that came out from the summit wato the u.s. and to israel, is that they have nothing to fear from a meeting of arab leaders. in beirut, muslim leaders rejected the results of cairo, and took aim at the u.s. they called for an oil embargo against the west, and, where possible, the banning of all american products. all this was happening as prime minister barak told israelis his cabinet now endorses his timeout plan for the peace process. there are no negotiations right now, but once it is possible to resume that, israel will be there. coming into this weekend, president clinton had hoped to bring the two sides together for yet another summit next month. but after yasser arafat's return from cai, the prospects are not good. arafat had blistering words for prime minister barak, up until now his partner in the peace process. our people is continuing the road to jerusalem, the capital of our independent palestinian state, to accept or not to accept it, let him go to hell. here on the west bank, the continuing clashes and ongoing gun fights are drowning out the words of political leaders on both sides. the palestinians on the streets here are convinced the peace process is not just suspended, it's dead. shelling and even if the politicians manage to resurrect it somehow, reviving the peace process here on the ground is another matter. richard gizbert, abc news, ramallah.

secretary of state madeleine albright is in another korea tonight, the highest-ranking u.s. firblg ever to visit. more from nbc's net colt. it's a mission that would have been unthinkable just months ago -- the secretary of state flying into north korea, a hard-line communist nation closed to the west since the korean war, a country long seen by the west as a threat to regional and global peace. six years ago, the north's missile program prompted some u.s. lawmakers to call for a preemptive missile strike against pyongyang. but now, the walls of the hermit kingdom are coming down, first with this unprecedented visit by south korea's president, kim dae jung, then tearful reunions between families separated by decades of conflict. just last week, south korean engineers detonated some of the millions of mines separating the two sides in this most heavily fortified border in the world, the dmz. the plan? to reopen road and rail links between north and south. north korean leader kim jong il is still a hard-line communist, but worsening economic conditions are forcing him to open up. kim dae-jung came to the conclusion if he was going to survive and if his regime was going to survive, they were going to have to have much closer relations, particularly the economic field, with south korea, the united states and others. this visit with kim jong il is likely to be heavy on symbolism, light on substance, with albright exploring what kim wants and how far he's willing to go. i think she will be looking to see whether they are really serious about arms control, arms reduction and putting the peninsula on a real peacetime footing. progress toward peace in one of the most volatile places on earth, home to 37,000 american troops, and paving the way for another first next month, the possible visit by a u.s. president to north korea. ned colt, nbc news.

Eager to demonstrate a get-tough attitude toward Israel while keeping the door ajar to a resumption of peace talks, Arab leaders said Sunday that they would freeze all but formal diplomatic contact with Israel until it made tangible progress toward a final settlement with the Palestinians. In a strongly worded but carefully calibrated statement signed by all but one member of the 22-nation Arab League, the leaders accused Israel of committing atrocities in the last three weeks of clashes with Palestinians. They urged the United Nations to set up a war crimes tribunal to judge Israeli actions and pledged vast aid to relieve the battered Palestinian economy. But they stopped well short of renouncing the peace treaties that Egypt and Jordan have already signed with Israel and did not suggest that the Palestinians themselves reject further negotiations in pursuit of an independent state. Instead, the Arab League _ which at its first summit meeting in four years was under severe scrutiny from the Palestinians and their supporters throughout the Arab world _ said it would end its participation in all official and unofficial efforts to integrate Israel into the economy of the Middle East. The low-level diplomatic contacts that have started in the last few years between Arab states and Israel, including trade and political exchanges, would also be suspended. ``We are not going to let Israel do whatever it wants,'' Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Mousa declared, speaking to reporters. ``We have all this pressure on us, telling us that Israel needs to feel a part of the region. Well, if it wants to be part of the region, it has to act according to the law.'' The statement from the meeting did not directly criticize the United States for supporting Israel, as the leaders had asserted in their public speeches. But it did take a swipe at Washington, insisting that Jerusalem should not be recognized as the capital of Israel. President Clinton had said in July that he might consider moving the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv, where most nations have their diplomatic representation, to disputed Jerusalem. The Arab leaders said they would break relations with any country that did so before negotiations settle Jerusalem's internationally recognized status as a disputed city. The Arab leaders seemed conscious that this summit was a test of credibility for the Arab League, which in its 55-year history has been fractured, uniting most easily over the treatment of the Palestinians. Moussa, acting as an unofficial spokesman for the leaders gathered here, took care to underline that Arab governments were not indifferent to the anger on their streets at Israeli conduct. Libya proclaimed itself the voice of stifled Arab masses yearning for a complete break with Israel. Its delegates walked out of the summit meeting a few hours after it convened on Saturday, dismissing the Arab League deliberations as a rhetorical exercise that would merely result in empty threats to Israel. Arab leaders generally regard Libya and its erratic leader, Col. Moammar Gadhafi, as a perpetually maverick element in their midst, but they clearly feared that their summit might be perceived in much the same terms by their own people. In the Arab world, public preoccupation with the bloodshed in the Palestinian territories _ in which more than 120 have died, all but eight of them Arabs _ has sparked mass demonstrations and open calls for war. Many commentators on Arabic television and in newspapers have speculated that the protests could turn against the authoritarian Arab regimes. Again and again, Moussa found himself on the defensive when confronted by Arab journalists, who repeatedly questioned whether the Arab League was truly in touch with the public mood and would follow through on its promises. ``We _ all of us here _ are part of the Arab public,'' he responded, adding that ``all Arabs _ left, right and center and whoever represents them, whether governments, the street or students _ are angry.'' ``We mean business here,'' Moussa declared. Immediately after the summit, Tunisia announced that it would shut its political liaison office in Tel Aviv and close the corresponding Israeli office in Tunis. A government statement said the break was in response to ``bloody Israeli aggression against the fraternal Palestinian people.'' Oman has already closed a small Israeli trade office that was operating in Muscat. Qatar said Sunday it would ``calmly'' consider the possibility of closing the Israeli trade office in its capital. Morocco has a junior diplomat still stationed in Tel Aviv. The Arab leaders, who have unanimously backed the Palestinian demand for Arab sovereignty over East Jerusalem, also noted that Jerusalem's status is internationally acknowledged as a subject for negotiation. The Arab leaders, as a group, also said they would boycott any official or unofficial gatherings with Israeli on regional economic cooperation. That freeze is likely to have more of a political than practical effect, since Syria and Lebanon have boycotted such meetings ever since they were initiated after the Madrid peace conference in 1991, and the talks have been infrequent. It was not clear if Arab nations would not go to international gatherings attended by Israel, like economic development conferences sponsored by the European Union. The Cairo gathering, the first Arab League summit meeting in a decade to include Iraq, brought together the divergent trends in the Arab world. Persian Gulf kings and princes, wearing long white robes and gilt-edged gauzy cloaks, mingled with Arab presidents in business suits. But their old divisions were not healed. Representatives of Kuwait and Saudi Arabia refused to even make eye contact with delegates from Iraq, which had been banished from Arab League summits after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait. An Iraqi official said that even the president of Mauritania turned his back on him. Mauritania, one of Iraq's biggest boosters during the Gulf War, broke relations with Baghdad after the Iraqis condemned it for establishing relations with Israel. The Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, in his trademark military uniform, looked drawn and shrunken, far from the lively and excitable figure he once cut at Arab meetings. During the televised speeches, he frequently appeared detached and when the leaders gathered between sessions to chat and embrace, he was often seen standing alone. He had lost the financial support of the Gulf nations after he backed Iraq in the Gulf War. With their own people supporting the Palestinians very publicly, Arab leaders decided to offer Arafat their full political support and promised $1 billion in aid to protect Islamic and Arab properties in Jerusalem and to help the families of Palestinians killed or injured in the fighting with Israel. The summit provided a glimpse of the shape of future disputes among the Arab leaders. Iraq and Syria, using different language, urged the Arab states to develop a long-term strategy that approaches Israel as a rival military and economic power. The young Syrian president Bashar Assad revived a perennial theme: that only by combining their financial and military power could the Arabs forge what he called a ``peace of the strong'' rather than a peace founded on the perceived weakness of Arab nations. Iraq, taking a different tack, proposed a vision of the Arab world that would reject alliances with the United States. As things stand, however, Egypt, which commands the strongest military machine in the Arab world, maintains close ties with the United States, Israel's leading ally, and conducts joint military exercises with American troops. Most of the Persian Gulf states also have military cooperation agreements with the United States. Using oil as a weapon, which squeezed the West after the 1973 Arab-Israeli war, has been disavowed by Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, also close American allies. A few of the Arab leaders, notably the young kings of Morocco and Jordan, took note of the changed circumstances. They argued that military consolidation is outdated, that the world around the Middle East has organized itself into common markets, and that the Arabs should concentrate on competing economically and technologically. This summit declaration went a few steps further than the statement agreed upon in 1996, after the last meeting of Arab heads of state. Convened after the election of the right-wing Benjamin Netanyahu as prime minister of Israel, the Arab leaders then warned Israel that they would adjust the pace of normalizing relations according to progress in the peace talks. The public theme of this weekend's summit, however, was that the peace process, in the form it has been conducted since the Oslo agreement in 1993, is no longer valid. Moussa dismissed Israel's peace-making activity as little more than ``shuttling to Washington and photo opportunities.'' The uprising by Palestinians, the summit statement said, is a direct outcome of Israel's ``inflexibility, stalling and failure to implement its commitments.''

Despite new clues that suggest the bombing of the destroyer Cole may have involved more than the two men who died in the blast, American officials cautioned Sunday against concluding that they were close to identifying the group responsible or to retaliating militarily. Eleven days after the attack that killed 17 sailors and wounded 39, Yemeni officials working with the Americans in the investigation said they had found three more houses used by the suspects, bringing the total discovered so far to five. Yemeni security sources also said that a group of officials in Lahej, a town about 25 miles north, had been detained for allegedly allowing offices there to issue identity documents with assumed names that were used in the conspiracy. One of those documents was an identity card thought to have belonged to one of the two men who pulled a skiff alongside the Cole in Aden harbor and detonated enough explosives to blow a hole 40 feet in diameter in the vessel's port side. In a report citing Yemeni security sources close to the investigation, the Associated Press said Saturday that the document was issued in the name of Abdullah Ahmed Khaled al-Musawah, but the American and Yemeni officials refused to confirm the name or to say that the name represented a significant breakthrough. The identity card was part of evidence uncovered by the Yemenis earlier last week when a 12-year-old Yemeni boy led them to an abandoned vehicle and a boat trailer left beside a remote boat ramp about six miles from the harbor mooring point where the Cole was attacked. The boy also led them to the first two houses used by the suspects, in the neighborhoods of Little Aden and Medinat Ash Shab. Yemeni officials, who reported Sunday that they had uncovered the additional houses used by the suspect, would only say they were in or near Aden. When the earlier discoveries were made known, six days after the bombing, American officials implied that the trail followed by FBI agents, who have accompanied Yemeni investigators at every stage of the investigation, had gone cold after it was established that an important document found in one of the houses, a driver's license, was issued in a false name. The trail led, among other places, to Hahdramaut, a remote province in eastern Yemen named on the license as the holder's place of origin. This left them with a photograph of a man on the license, said to have been in his 30s or early 40s, who investigators believe may have been ``the bearded man with spectacles'' identified by the Yemeni boy as having drawn up in the vehicle on the morning of the Cole attack. On Sunday, a Yemeni official confirmed that the vehicle found near the boat ramp was a Nissan with four-wheel-drive, of a kind widely used in this country of rocky deserts and rugged mountain passes. Officials in Washington have said the boat was 20 feet to 26 feet long and white, and that shards found on the Cole, now being examined along with other evidence at FBI laboratories in Washington, indicated that it was made of fiberglass. A tank apparently used to test the boat's outboard motor was found at one of the houses. Barbara Bodine, the American ambassador to Yemen, said on Saturday that the investigation was ``expanding,'' to the point that American officials were confident that they would break the case. But after the report Sunday about a name on the driver's license, American officials here tried to discourage speculation that they were closing in on suspects. They said their ``prime suspect'' was ``the broad jihadist network'' _ the array of Islamic militant groups from east Asia to the Middle East that have declared a ``holy war,'' or jihad in Arabic, against the United States. At a briefing, the officials insisted that they were far from being able to recommend possible targets for a retaliatory American military strike of the kind hinted at by President Clinton in the aftermath of the Cole attack that those responsible would be held ``accountable'' and allowed ``no safe harbor.'' (BEGIN OPTIONAL TIRM) After the terrorist bombings of two American embassies in East Africa in August 1998, Clinton ordered Navy cruise missile strikes on targets in Sudan and Afghanistan, saying that an American investigation had identified Osama bin Laden, the Saudi Arabian exile and Islamic militant living in Afghanistan, as the prime figure in the attacks. Bin Laden, who has a $5 million American reward on his head, recently issued warnings of fresh attacks on American targets through a videotape delivered to an Arab-language satellite television channel in Qatar. His name has frequently entered into the Cole investigation, especially after President Ali Abdullah Saleh of Yemen disclosed that the fake driver's license named Hadhramaut, the ancestral home of bin Laden's family, which moved to Saudi Arabia in the 1950s. American officials have insisted from the outset of the Cole investigation that their priority in making public statements would be to avoid anything that would ``chill leads.'' This has suggested that they will have a strong incentive to avoid giving out information that would tip off potential targets of a military strike, as appears to have happened in 1998, when bin Laden fled one of his training camps in Afghanistan shortly before the missiles struck. (END OPTIONAL TRIM) But Sunday they insisted that there was nothing yet to justify speculation that an attack might be imminent. They acknowledged that bin Laden's recent marriage in the Afghan city of Kandahar to a Yemeni woman, possibly one from Hadhramaut, could indicate he wanted to strengthen contacts with Yemen ahead of a possible move from Afghanistan, but insisted that they were not yet focusing on any individual, group or country as responsible for the Cole attack. ``Even if you were considering a military response at this point, we have no idea where,'' one official said. ``Do we go to Afghanistan, Pakistan _ that's way down the line.''

The remains of the last of the 17 sailors killed in a suspected terrorist attack on USS Cole were returned to the United States on Sunday for burial. Family members watched from the tarmac as pallbearers removed four flag-draped caskets from a military plane and carried them to waiting hearses before an honor guard. Two of the deceased were identified as Hull Maintenance Technician 3rd Class Kenneth Eugene Clodfelter, 21, of Mechanicsville, Va., and Fireman Apprentice Patrick Howard Roy, 19, of Keedysville, Md. Maj. Frank Smolinsky, chief of public affairs at the base, said he could not identify the other two sailors whose remains were returned. The bodies will be examined at the Dover base for evidence and prepared for burial and then delivered to their next-of-kin. The remains of eight sailors have so far been returned to their families for burial. On Saturday, the family of Seaman Craig Wibberley buried the 19-year-old near his hometown of Williamsport in western Maryland. More than 700 people, including Lt. Gov. Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, attended the funeral. ``Whether you've been in the service for one day or 20 or 30 years, it's important to show that all of us are members of a family,'' said retired Air Force officer Susan Hankey Webb, who was those attending. In all, 17 sailors were killed and 39 others were injured Oct. 12 when an explosion tore a 40-by-40-foot hole in the USS Cole while the destroyer was refueling in the Yemeni port of Aden. Authorities in Yemen have been searching houses and other locations believed to have been used by two suicide bombers and possibly others involved in the attack. A senior U.S. government official in Aden, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said a great deal of physical evidence had been found, though he wouldn't elaborate. Meanwhile, sailors on the USS Cole continued repair work on the destroyer while divers collected forensic evidence from the sea bed below the damaged ship. The 505-foot destroyer is to eventually be carried back to the United States on the deck of a ``heavy lift'' vessel. ___ On the Net: Navy: http://www.navy.mil/

Breaking down one of the last barriers of the Cold War, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright opened a historic visit to North Korea on Monday by paying her respects to the late Kim Il Sung, the Soviet-trained ruler who formed the communist nation 55 years ago. Albright hopes to use the two-day visit to advance her goal of a tension-free Northeast Asia for the first time in decades and to lay the groundwork for a visit by President Clinton, possibly as early as next month. No other secretary of state has visited North Korea and none of Albright's predecessors had even considered the idea because of the grim state of the relationship. Albright planned to meet later in the day with North Korean leader Kim Jong Il. Arriving in Pyongyang shortly after dawn, Albright was greeted by North Korea's vice foreign minister, Kim Gye Gwan. An 8-year-old boy wearing a red kerchief around his neck presented her with a bouquet of flowers. Her motorcade, which included vehicles driven up from the U.S. Embassy in Seoul, South Korea, drove down deserted boulevards to the Kim Il Sung Palace, where the remains of the longtime North Korean leader are on display. The sprawling edifice was once used as a meeting palace for foreign dignitaries, but was converted to a mausoleum after Kim's death. Down the road, a large sign attached to the front of one of the buildings read, ``The Great Leader Kim Il Sung is always with us.'' At a kindergarten in the Rang Nang District, Albright watched dozens of children perform traditional dances to accordian music. The school also serves as a distribution point for the U.N. World Food Program. ``Your work is vital because these children and their brothers and sisters around the country should be able to grow up without fear of emergency shortages and famine,'' Albright told staff members. ``And international donors should be assured that the supplies they send are used for the purposes intended.'' She noted that over the years the United States has contributed nearly 1.5 million tons of food to the program, which serves about 8 million North Koreans. Albright left Washington shortly after midnight Sunday on the 17-hour journey to the North Korean capital, a city U.S. forces had reduced to rubble during the Korean War. It is now a metropolis with tall buildings and broad boulevards, although with scarcely any traffic. If her talks with Kim go well, Clinton will follow her to Pyongyang as part of an Asia trip next month, administration officials said. ``We still believe there are very significant steps that have to be taken to meet the concerns the United States has,'' said a senior State Department official aboard Albright's plane, speaking on the condition of anonymity. ``We have reason to believe that because of discussions that we have had that North Korea may be prepared to take some very serious steps.'' Albright's main concern is North Korea's missile development program and its export of missiles to Iran and Syria. She will confer with Kim on those issues but officials said no agreements are expected. The United States is considering the creation of a national missile defense, partly out of concern that North Korea may some day direct ICBM's at American cities. North Korea has for years ignored American efforts to stop exporting missiles, and the possibility that the Pyongyang regime may now be listening to these concerns has generated excitement among arms control advocates. In Clinton's quest for a foreign policy legacy worthy of the history books, his initiative with North Korea seems more promising than any other, a turn of events few would have predicted six years ago when the two counties seemed close to war. Clinton has shown patience and diligence in seeking an accommodation with North Korea. His initiative has prospered, at least for the time being, because of a surprise willingness of Kim to reciprocate. Kim, perhaps motivated by economic catastrophe, has scrapped North Korea's policy of reclusiveness and has been reaching out not only to the United States but to other countries, most notably South Korea. In the process, Kim has shed the stereotypical view of him. Don Oberdorfer, a Korea expert at the Johns Hopkins School of International Studies, said Kim was depicted in intelligence reports as an awful man who was ``introverted and strange.'' But he showed himself to be ``very confident and very poised'' when in June he had his historic encounter with South Korean President Kim Dae-jung. Conservative groups are concerned that Clinton may be taken in by the newly amiable North Korean leader. The Center for Security Policy cites a classified Pentagon report leaked last month asserting that there is no evidence that North Korea is changing fundamentally and that there has been no reduction in North Korea's military. After two days of discussion in Pyongyang, Albright will fly across the Demilitarized Zone to Seoul to report on her talks to senior officials from Japan and South Korea, both of which continue to be nervous about North Korea's military. As a deterrent, the United States maintains 37,000 troops in South Korea. Albright's arrival in North Korea was televised on South Korean television. Just two weeks ago, Kim dispatched to Washington his right hand man, Vice Marshall Jo Myong Rok. The visit produced a communique in which the two sides pledged ``to take steps to fundamentally improve their bilateral relations in the interests of enhancing peace and security in the Asia-Pacific region.'' The two countries do not have diplomatic relations, but have discussed the possibility of opening liaison offices in each other's capital. ___ On the Net: State Department backgrounder on North Korea: http://www.state.gov/www/background_notes/north_korea_0696_bgn.html State Department backgrounder on South Korea: http://www.state.gov/www/background_notes/southkorea_0006_bgn.html

The Pyongyang Metro is not only a way to get around, it's also an education in socialist ideology: Murals of robust workers on some station walls glorify the revolution led by North Korean leader Kim Jong Il. On the street, a teen-ager on a podium conducts a school brass band in a stirring patriotic tune, not so much to entertain passers-by as to encourage them to rally around the ideals that Kim is said to personify. With his portly frame, owlish glasses and fluffy coiffure, Kim doesn't altogether match his godlike image of omniscience among his insulated people. But the man that North Koreans call ``Great Leader'' also benefits from a reputation as a humble populist. Now his recent efforts to reconcile with South Korea and engage the world, albeit on limited terms, are likely to reinforce his mandate by lending him an image at home as an international statesman. In just a few months, the communist leader has held unprecedented meetings with Chinese President Jiang Zemin, South Korean President Kim Dae-jung and Russian President Vladimir Putin. The North is also moving toward rapprochement with the United States, which it still occasionally brands an imperialist menace. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright arrived in Pyongyang on Monday ahead of a possible visit by President Clinton next month. Her host, groomed for power by his father and national founder, Kim Il Sung, was once a mysterious figure and the target of virulent South Korean propaganda that portrayed him as a recluse, a drunk, a womanizer and a kidnapper. But Kim Jong Il's recent public appearances have revealed an easy confidence, a taste for banter and a dramatic flair. For example, he unexpectedly showed up at the Pyongyang airport to greet Kim Dae-jung ahead of their conciliatory summit in June. In a recent talk with South Korean media executives, Kim said he sleeps four hours a night and swims and rides horses once or twice a week. ``I also argue with party officials. I get upset when I see them. These people are stuck in their ways and don't try to change,'' he said. Not long ago, Kim Jong Il was viewed as a villain in the West, ruler of a totalitarian regime and a suspected sponsor of terrorism in the 1980s. But he has won praise for finally responding to South Korea's appeals to seek peace. Washington, eager to reduce the threat of war on the divided Korean peninsula, appears willing to set aside for now concerns about human rights in the communist state and concentrate on the North's long-range missile program and other issues. The meeting with Albright is likely to elevate Kim Jong Il's domestic standing, showing that his relatively poor and weak nation can negotiate at the highest levels with the world's most powerful country. Some analysts believe North Korea triggered a crisis over its nuclear program in the early 1990s because it wanted direct talks with Washington. Kim, who wants to shed his nation's pariah image and win more international aid for his dilapidated economy, stages frequent trips to farms, factories, mines and army barracks. There, he offers ``on-the-spot guidance'' in a populist practice pioneered by his father. KCNA, the North's foreign news outlet, reported last week on a visit by Kim to a catfish farm: ``He went round the interior and exterior of the farm and said that the overall construction was done best in terms of quality.'' Kim keeps the loyalty of his soldiers, the prop of his political power base, with food, funds and gifts. The military's missile program is a proud symbol of national sovereignty. Whether in sincerity or shrewdness, Kim has solidified his rule by casting himself as a humble disciple of his revered father, whose death in 1994 prompted a national outpouring of grief. On Monday, North Koreans paid tribute at the Great Monument on Mansu Hill, a 66-foot-high bronze statue of Kim Il Sung with an arm outstretched. Two navy sailors laid bouquets and a woman bowed while others swept around the base with brooms. Kim Jong Il doesn't want that kind of adulation, said guide Cha Ryong Nam. ``He wants to be simple,'' Cha said. ``Although the people regard him as a great leader in the world, he says he's only a soldier of President Kim Il Sung.''

Rounding the Final Turn Some had begun to doubt that it would ever arrive. But here it is at last: the home stretch. The time when pollsters take pulses daily, media consultants are kicking up the advertising buys a notch in swing states, and candidates, surrogates and pundits are coming to terms with the fallout from the debates. ``I thought he literally was going to hit him,'' Barbara Bush said on the campaign trail last week after the final of the three presidential forums, a town hall meeting in St. Louis. The former first lady was upset by what she concluded was Vice President Al Gore's effort to intimidate her son Gov. George W. Bush by crowding him on the stage of Washington University, an act that she said prompted her husband, former President George Bush, to shout at the television, ``My God!'' It is that time in the campaign season when nerves start to fray. And this year the tension is particularly high: polls indicate it could be the closest election since 1960. Consider the ramifications: The network anchors holding court in studios on the Eastern Seaboard might not call the race until after Californians get home from work and go to the polls. What if everyone had to stay up for Hawaii? After the debate, Gore and Bush resumed their transcontinental quests to win over the undecideds and persuade the ``persuadables,'' those waffling potential voters who are recruited by the news shows to fill the seats in their on-air focus groups. Each candidate was taking sharper aim at his rival. The Democrats ran new ads attacking Bush's environmental and education record in Texas. The Republicans replied with new spots labeling Gore a spendthrift who will rapidly run through the surplus. With just a bit more than two weeks to go, political analysts say, things are likely to get rougher. Fashion Forward Armed Forces At the dawning of a new century and millennium, the U.S. Army is undertaking what its chief of staff, Gen. Eric K. Shinseki, calls a ``transformation.'' This is a big deal, so big, in fact, that last week the general announced that all of his soldiers would get new caps. Starting next year, standard headgear for the Army's 480,000 soldiers and officers _ its cooks, its clerks, its drivers _ will be the black beret, which since 1975 has been the exclusive symbol of the Army's elite infantry cadre, the Rangers. This sartorial transformation spells the end of the rectangular hat _ known officially as the ``overseas cap,'' but more familiarly referred to as the ``envelope hat'' since it folds up as neatly as an envelope _ that has been in use for much of the past century. Shinseki announced his directive in a speech devoted to the challenges facing the Army, which has been slow to adapt to today's post-Cold War world. The black beret, he said, would symbolize his own proposals to make the Army a leaner, more agile force, ready to fight and win anywhere in the world. ``It will be a symbol of unity, a symbol of Army excellence, a symbol of our values,'' he declared. As symbolism goes, however, the directive fell flat. At a time when the Army is struggling to recruit soldiers, hold on to its young officers and maintain its tactical relevance when wars are far more likely to be fought with jets and missiles than ground troops, many soldiers called the beret little more than window dressing. Others gripes were more immediate. ``The beret leaves lines on your forehead,'' one staff sergeant said. As could have been predicted, the harshest response came from the Rangers. Like the Army's airborne soldiers, who wear maroon berets, and the special forces, who wear green (and who, contrary to Hollywood habit, do not like to be called ``green berets'') the Rangers consider the black beret a hard-earned badge of honor. How Just Is Justice in the Lone Star State? Texas Defender Service, a nonprofit group of defense lawyers, released a broad and scathing assessment of Texas' administration of the death penalty. The group found that the system was corroded with prosecutorial misconduct, racial bias and a failure to provide adequate counsel to indigent capital defendants. The report also said too many defendants are convicted based on unreliable testimony from jailhouse informants or from dubious experts. State officials and prosecutors rejected the claims. The Beginning of the End For the Cuba Boycott The Senate decisively approved legislation relaxing nearly 40 years of sanctions on the sale of food to Cuba. The measure, endorsed 86-8, now seems assured of becoming law, but anti-communist opponents of Fidel Castro's regime were successful in winning prohibitions on U.S. government credit and private financing for any sales, which will make it difficult, if not impossible, for food shipments to be made to Cuba in the near future. Colds and Heart Attacks Citing evidence that the active ingredient in dozens of decongestants and appetite suppressants poses a small risk of stroke in young women, a panel of scientific experts recommended the chemical be removed from over-the-counter products. Drug makers insist the ingredient, phenylpropanolamine, or PPA, is safe. A decision by the Food and Drug Administration is pending; meanwhile, officials advise consumers to read labels carefully. Relief for the Poorest Bono, Pat Robertson, George W. Bush and Pope John Paul II make a formidable lobbying quartet. The rock star, religious leaders and Republican presidential candidate joined forces to pressure Congress to finance the U.S. share of debt relief for 41 poor nations. Some senior Republican lawmakers have criticized the program, but congressional leaders say President Clinton is now likely to get the full $435 million he requested for the international program this year.

Putting aside a half-century of acrimony, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and North Korean leader Kim Jong Il engaged in unprecedented talks Monday aimed at laying the groundwork for a visit by President Clinton to one of the last bastions of the Cold War. With a firm handshake, Albright and Kim moved their two nations _ one democratic, the other communist _ a bit closer together. Kim noted that Albright was the first secretary of state to ever visit North Korea. ``This is a new one from a historical point of view,'' he said. ``I am really very happy.'' Responded Albright, ``I'm very glad to be here in your beautiful city.'' The two spoke for three hours, with a 15-minute break, and during the meeting Albright gave Kim a letter from Clinton anticipating further developments in bilateral relations. ``The visit is historic,'' said State Department spokesman Richard Boucher. But there are ``a lot of things that have to be discussed; a lot of issues that have to be dealt with.'' ``Being able to deal successfully with these issues is the key to having a successful visit by the president,'' he said. North Korea's missile program is one such issue, and Washington also wants the regime to break any remaining links with terrorism. Albright arrived to a low-key arrival ceremony that belied the significance of her visit. Asked if the United States was moving too quickly in the relationship with North Korea, she said, ``We're not moving faster than it makes sense.'' Images of Kim's father and North Korea founder Kim Il Sung were everywhere as Albright traveled from the airport to downtown, a reminder of the country's communist origins more than 50 years ago. The face of the ``Great Leader,'' as he is called, beamed from an airport mural, from billboards and from signs adorning buildings along Albright's route. Her first stop was at the Kim Il Sung Palace, which was converted into a mausoleum after his death in 1994. Despite the overtures inherent in Albright's visit and the efforts to set up one by Clinton, U.S. officials warned in advance that serious differences remained between the two nations. Of primary concern is North Korea's missile development program and its export of missiles to Iran and Syria. Albright raised those issues with Kim Jong Il but officials said no agreements are expected. North Korea has been included on the U.S. list of states supporting international terrorism since January 1988, after North Korean agents bombed a South Korean airliner, KAL Flight 858, in November 1987, killing 115 people. South Korean officials welcomed the Albright trip. ``We must consider as desirable the North Korean moves to set up new relations with the outside world,'' said presidential spokesman Park Joon-young. Some critics feared, however, the visit might make Pyongyang less willing to talk to the South. Albright and Kim met in the luxury guest house where she was staying. Plush carpet lined the floors, and crystal chandeliers hung from the high ceiling. Later Monday, she planned to attend a dinner hosted by Kim. North Korea is suffering from a severe food shortage, and Albright visited a kindergarten in the Rang Nang District that participates in the U.N. World Food Program The kindergarten children, lined up in neat rows on a dirt playground, performed traditional dances for Albright, who mimicked their motions. A small boy hid behind a white sack of U.S.-donated wheat while a classmate tossed the white powder at him. The United States has contributed nearly 1.5 million tons of food to the U.N. program, Albright said. She told the food program staff: ``Your work is vital because these children and their brothers and sisters around the country should be able to grow up without fear of emergency shortages and famine. And international donors should be assured that the supplies they send are used for the purposes intended.'' Later, Kim asked her how the kindergarten visit went. ``I danced with the children. I'm very satisfied,'' she said. Security was tight in North Korea's traditionally closed society. Journalists were admonished not to explore the city on their own. ``You must submit to a schedule,'' a senior Information Ministry official told them. As Clinton seeks to build a foreign policy legacy in the waning days of his administration, his opening toward North Korea seems more promising than any other, a turn of events few would have predicted six years ago when the two countries seemed close to war. Kim has shown a surprise willingness to reciprocate to Clinton's moves to seek accommodation. He has been reaching out not only to the United States but to other countries, most notably South Korea. In a communique issued two weeks ago at the conclusion of a visit to Washington by Jo Myong Rok, a top Kim adviser, the two nations pledged ``to take steps to fundamentally improve their bilateral relations in the interests of enhancing peace and security in the Asia-Pacific region.'' Kim thanked Albright for her making the arrangements for Jo's visit and ensuring that it went smoothly. The threat of war has hung over the Korean peninsula since the end of the Korean War in 1953. About 37,000 American troops are stationed in South Korea. ``The U.S. government is very clear, as is the Republic of Korea, that American military forces need to remain in Korea even after there is a reduction in tension and even if there is reunification on the Korean peninsula,'' State Department official Morton Halperin said Monday during a visit to Canberra, Australia. ``We are at a historic moment in which the last remaining Cold War confrontation may finally be coming to an end,'' he said. ``As we move forward we need to move carefully, we need to remember that there is still a very serious North Korean military threat on the peninsula.'' The United States is considering the creation of a national missile defense, partly out of concern that North Korea may someday direct ICBM's at American cities. North Korea has for years ignored American efforts to stop it from exporting missiles. There are indications that Pyongyang may be beginning to listen to those concerns. Albright's visit to North Korea followed one by China's defense minister, Gen. Chi Haotian. In meetings Sunday with North Korea's defense minister, Vice Marshal Kim Il Chol, Chi promised that China would maintain strong military ties with Pyongyang, according to Chinese state media. China has ties with both North and South Korea. After two days of talks in North Korea, Albright planned to fly across the Demilitarized Zone to Seoul to brief senior officials from Japan and South Korea. Both nations continue to be nervous about North Korea's military. ___ On the Net: State Department backgrounder on North Korea: http://www.state.gov/www/background_notes/north_korea_0696_bgn.html

Early returns Monday showed an opposition candidate in a close race with the junta leader in Ivory Coast's elections, billed as a return to civilian government 10 months after a military coup. Opposition leader Laurent Gbagbo predicted victory over Gen. Robert Guei, although the votes counted so far from Sunday's election came from mainly rural areas and small towns. Ballots in major cities, including Abidjan, had yet to be tabulated. Gbagbo had 51.35 percent and Guei had 40.40 percent of the 126,683 ballots counted so far, a national election commission official announced on state-run television. The remaining votes were divided between three minor candidates. Final results remained far from clear. The preliminary figures accounted for a tiny fraction of the total possible vote from about 5.5 million registered voters. Turnout figures were incomplete, although voting often was reported at less than 30 percent in a random check Sunday of polling stations in Ivorian cities. Election officials reported a turnout of just 34 percent in the areas counted so far. Voters were nearly nonexistent in many parts of Korhogo, the main city in the north and a stronghold of support for the disqualified main opposition leader, Alassane Dramane Ouattara. The country's two largest political parties boycotted the ballot after their leaders were barred from running. Gbagbo _ a former history professor and left-leaning politician _ was the only candidate who posed a threat to the junta leader. He said victory looked apparent. ``We believe we have won,'' he told cheering supporters at his campaign headquarters early Monday morning. Guei's spokesman, Desire-Paulin Dakoury, said the military leader declined to make predictions until the final result was clear. While Guei has thrown the weight of the junta behind his election, he has insisted he will step down if he loses. International observers reported minor irregularities, including missing voting materials and confusion over electoral procedures, but attributed the problems to ``disorder, not malice,'' said an official for the European Union, which had about 30 observers across the country. Most candidates, including those from the country's two largest political parties, were disqualified last month by the Supreme Court. Those two parties, Ouattara's Rally of the Republicans and the former ruling Democratic Party of the Ivory Coast, called the boycott. The United Nations, the Organization of African Unity, the European Union and countries such as the United States and Canada withdrew election observers or funding, saying the exclusion of major opponents made a truly free and fair election impossible. Guei (pronounced GAY-EE), whose own soldiers have staged two mutinies since the coup and who, officials say, survived an assassination attempt in September, has barely appeared in public during the campaign, apparently fearful of his security. Guei has seen his popularity plummet since the December coup, when cheering crowds filled the streets of some neighborhoods to welcome the ouster of President Henri Konan Bedie, who was widely seen as corrupt and ethnically divisive. Gbagbo (pronounced BAHG-bo), for his part, has long said he believed most voters would oppose Guei, who for many remains a soldier _ albeit one who now sports a suit and tie. Many of Gbagbo's supporters were already addressing him as ``president,'' and warned they would take to the streets if he was not declared the winner. Dozens of supporters paraded outside his suburban Abidjan home early Monday, chanting ``Let's celebrate victory!'' Ouattara, the country's best-known opposition candidate, was excluded after the Supreme Court said there were questions over whether both his parents were of ``Ivorian origin,'' as a new junta-backed constitution requires. The past year has seen Ivory Coast suffer through a series of crises, including the two military mutinies and a further erosion of the country's economy, already battered by a steep decline in prices for its primary exports, cocoa and coffee. The instability has frightened Ivorians and foreign investors alike. Ivory Coast is the world's largest cocoa producer.

Top Democrats are urging Missouri's new governor to appoint the widow of Mel Carnahan as senator if the late governor receives more votes than Sen. John Ashcroft in the Nov. 7 election. Carnahan, a Democrat, was in a tight race for the Senate when he, son Roger and campaign aide Chris Sifford were killed in a plane crash on their way to a rally last week. Carnahan's death came too late to take his name off the ballot. Should Carnahan get more votes, newly appointed Gov. Roger Wilson _ also a Democrat _ would have to appoint an interim senator to fill out the term until the November 2002 general election. ``I have discussed that scenario with the governor and with people who are very close to Jean Carnahan, and everyone is waiting for Mrs. Carnahan to say yes or no. It's her call,'' state Sen. James Mathewson, a close ally of Wilson, said Monday. ``She is absolutely the first choice.'' Wilson said Monday he ``can't wait very long'' to announce whom he would appoint, ``but it can wait a little while, more out of respect.'' Mrs. Carnahan has never run for office. She made no public comment about whether she would accept an appointment, and Carnahan campaign spokesman Tony Wyche said: ``Nothing has been discussed at that level yet, and definitely there has been no decision. Wilson, in an AP interview, declined to say whether he would name Mrs. Carnahan to the seat should her husband get more votes than Ashcroft, a first-term Republican senator who also was Missouri's governor from 1984 to 1992. However, he praised Mrs. Carnahan for her ``simply amazing'' public composure and dignity since her husband's death, including leading the memorial procession behind his casket on Friday during ceremonies that were broadcast statewide. ``It seems to me, with her display of grace under pressure, that Jean Carnahan can will herself to do whatever needs to be done to help people,'' Wilson said. On Sunday, in her first public comments since the crash, Mrs. Carnahan thanked Missourians for their prayers and hugs. ``I have been encircled by thousands,'' she said in a eulogy for Sifford. With her phrase, ``don't let the fire go out,'' politicians and analysts said they heard a tasteful slogan for the closing stretch of what had been a statistically even race. ``Her standing in for her husband could be as poignant and powerful as any political image ever shown, and it has to leave Ashcroft wondering how to respond, and it would be virtually impossible to respond,'' said Rick Hardy, a political science professor at the University of Missouri-Columbia. During a St. Louis appearance Monday, Ashcroft declined comment about the campaign. But John Hancock, executive director of the Missouri Republican Party, said: ``I assume the active Senate race is over, tragically over. I can't conceive of anybody at this point politicizing it. There is nothing the Republican Party can do, proactively, one way or the other. The ball is clearly not in our court.''

This is The World. I am Lisa Mullins. Putting aside a half century of acrimony, Secretary of State, Madeleine Albright met today with North Korea's leader Kim Jong Il in Pyongyang. Part of the purpose of this historic visit is to lay the groundwork for a possible trip to North Korea by President Clinton before his term ends. Albright's visit to Pyongyang is the first by a high level US official since the communist state was established in 1948. Kong Dan O is a Korean expert who has just written a book called 'North Korea through the Looking Glass'. She is now in the South Korean capital of Seoul. We know that the visit is making big news there in Seoul. Can you tell us what is being reported about the meeting between the two sides from the South Korean perspective? Well, when I look at about six major daily newspapers, basically the top news was Madeleine Albright meeting with the Chairman Kim Jong Il. And basically that indeed this is a very historic event, and some kind of euphoria and very positive upbeat feeling. But at the same time, the reports are basically telling the importance of this meeting that is that they have to talk about the very critical security matter issues such as missile and nuke. But nonetheless, the meeting was very crucial, so I think all in all, it was a very positive beginning. And how much of South Korea as you mentioned is bordering on euphoria, get this new relationship with Pyongyang and at the visit by Secretary of State Albright? I know that you have taken a more cautious approach, and I wonder if that applies to Secretary Albright's visit in general? Do you believe that the US is doing the right thing? Or is perhaps the United States, in your view, moving too quickly to try and patch things up? I am kind of taking a slightly cautious approach, simply because if Madam Albright is there, without the really thinking down the road some kind of strategic consequences of this meeting, simply because we are interested in seeing this gentleman and maybe before our term is over, let me meet you. I think that kind of simple approach to be wrong. But if she understands importance of this meeting and further brings up substance of issue to be resolved between the North Korea and the United States, I think that is very desirable. What you're saying is that you feel that the part of the impetus of the North is influenced by the fact that the United States has a presidential election just a couple of weeks away. I think that is a definitely correct statement, provided that maybe the Republican candidate, Mr. Bush to be elected. North Korea was very, very scared that Mr. Bush would take a much more hawkish and conservative approach. So before this Clinton administration comes to be over, they would like to lay down the ground rules and kind of create some kind of positive improvement to deal with the United States. And obviously one of the most important agendas for tomorrow is to discuss the possibilities of President Clinton's next visit sometime in November. I know that you have concerns about how a potential visit by President Clinton might be portrayed within North Korea itself. Why is that a concern of yours? My fundamental belief is that Kim Jong Il has not really made his mind or made a decision to push the reforms, even in the session of 1978 Chinese Reform that was taken by Dun Sha Pin. He is now gambling, he is trying, but he has not really changed his manner or his policy whatsoever. His economy and his society's politics is really getting in real deep trouble. He has to show his power and he's been telling his people that I am the true leader and the world is afraid of us. All the imperialist capitalist is afraid of us. That we are the center of the universe. Without the North Korea, the globe is not existing. Let me show you that I am the true leader and they will come to our country to pay visit, courtesy visit for me. And so now Putin visited, President Kim visited, Jiang Zemin will visit next year and the President Clinton will go. Domestic consumption of this visit will be immense, without changing any policy toward the freedom of proliferation . Is it really possible with the kind of close watch that the outside world is now going to be invited to give to North Korea, that Kim Jong Il could actually not change a thing in terms of his policies, internally or externally? I am exactly wondering like you, and I think that there is a maybe the possibility actually is going up. So I don't object really any of these like U.K. normalization, you know. I don't have any objection. But only when the leaders and the elite, the policy elite, is aware of that what they are bringing and what they are negotiating and how they would like to have an impact on North Korean society, I think that's the important key question. Kong Dan O is the author of the book 'North Korea through the Looking Glass', speaking to us from Seoul, South Korea. Thank you very much. Thank you.

In Ivory Coast, the government has delayed releasing results of Sunday's Presidential election. As Luis Ramirez reports from Abidjan. Supporters of the main opposition leaders staged a number of street demonstrations. Supporters of Socialist Laurent Gbagbo, the only major candidate allowed to run against military ruler General Robert Guei took to the street on Monday driving around Abidjan in caravans honking horns and demanding that the government release election results quickly. Early return showed Mr. Baboa ahead of General Gay in the elections, which are intended to restore civilian rule to the West African country, following its first coup last December. More than a full day after the polls closed, the National Election Commission had still not announced the final results. The electoral commission closed the doors of the building in Abidjan where the votes are being tallied, evicting journalists and others for several hours on Monday. Soldiers fired teargas at a group of Baboa supporters who tried to approach the building during the closure. The crowd was quickly dispersed. In Abidjan's plateau business districts, several streets remained closed off with barbed wire barricades and soldiers armed, patrol across the city. Luis Ramirez, VOA News, Abidjan.

Officials did not specify what threats were made, but they said they were based on credible intelligence information. One official was quoted as saying terrorist mastermind Osama Bin Laden is one of the suspects. The threats come as a massive investigation continues in Yemen, where an apparent terrorist attack killed 17 sailors aboard the USS Cole on October 12th.

us Secretary of State, Madeleine Albright and North Korean leader Kim Jong Il, are said to resume talks today in Pyongyang. The two met Monday for several hours, but there was no word on the substance of their discussion. The talks were expected to focus on North Korea's missile program and US concerns about Pyongyang's alleged support to terrorism. President Clinton commented to reporters Monday on administration hopes for the visit. Secretary Albright is there. We have some hope of resolving our outstanding differences with North Korea and looking forward to the day when they would truly close the last chapter in the aftermath of the Korean war. At a dinner in her honor late Monday, Ms. Albright said the road to fully normal relations between the United States and North Korea will remain uphill. US officials say if the talks go well, President Clinton will visit Pyongyang next month.

After a half-century of hostility, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and top North Korean officials are taking measured steps to move the U.S.-North Korean relationship toward a ``historic moment of thawing,'' Holding unprecedented talks, Albright and North Korean leader Kim Jong Il conferred for three hours Monday and planned a second meeting later Tuesday. ``We must move in steady strides away from the bitterness of the past for the common good,'' Albright said, toasting her North Korean hosts with red wine at a luncheon in her honor. Kim's top aide, Jo Myong Rok told Albright that her visit would contribute to ``further important breakthroughs'' between their two countries. A relationship ``that has been frozen so deep over the past several decades is now reaching the historic moment of thawing,'' he said in the toast, which was read by Vice Foreign Minister Kim Gye Gwan. Earlier in the day, Albright paid courtesy calls Tuesday on President Kim Yong Nam, the ceremonial head of state, and the North Korean foreign minister, Paek Nam Sun. Albright's journey to the cloistered communist state, unprecedented for a top U.S. official, was a possible curtain raiser for a visit by President Clinton next month aimed at exploiting one of the most dramatic diplomatic openings since the Cold War ended. Yet North Korea's missile-building and export program, its past support for terrorism and its massive armies _ in a country where hundreds of thousands have starved and an estimated one in three people have depended on international food shipments _ stand as impediments to a quick rapprochement. There was no immediate indication whether Albright and Kim had resolved their differences in their first day of talks. Describing the events in Pyongyang as moving, although overshadowed by violence in the Middle East, President Clinton said, ``We have some hope of resolving our outstanding differences with North Korea and looking forward to the day when they will truly close the last chapter in the aftermath of the Korean War.'' White House spokesman Jake Siewert said Clinton would not decide whether to travel to North Korea until Albright returns. Toasts were also exchanged at a dinner Monday night. ``The road to normal relations remains uphill,'' Albright said. Jo, who opened the bold diplomatic initiative with a visit to Washington two weeks ago, said improved relations ``will be good for both countries and for peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula and the Northeast Asian region as well.'' Venturing into the so-called hermit kingdom _ a name originally applied to the sheltered Korea of the 19th century but now meaning the secretive north _ Albright had a day in which her every step was a first of some sort. Greeting each other, Kim and Albright clasped all four hands in a knot and smiled broadly. ``This is a new one from a historical point of view,'' Kim said. ``I am really very happy.'' Images of Kim's father and North Korea founder Kim Il Sung were everywhere as Albright swept in from the airport past cabbage fields, greenhouses and then drab apartment buildings of the capital. Her first stop was at the Kim Il Sung Palace, which was converted into a mausoleum after his death in 1994. Later, a delighted Albright mimicked the motions of kindergarten children who performed traditional dances for her on a dirt playground. The school doubles as a distribution center for donated food; a boy hid behind a white sack labeled USA Wheat as a classmate tossed the powder at him. ``I danced with the children,'' she said. ``I'm very satisfied.'' She was also treated to dazzling acrobatics and dance _ with a vivid display of the adoration Kim can command from his controlled masses _ at a stadium where tens of thousands cheered him, forming pictures with hand-held cards as gymnasts performed for the glory of the military, workers, the party, and ``the red flag of faith.'' Albright sat with Kim for the performance but was not introduced to the crowd. When it came to business, the two met for three hours, with a 15-minute break, at the lavish Paek Hwa Won Guest House. They sat across a wooden table polished to such a gloss that their reflections were crisply mirrored in the sheen. They posed before a painting of storm-tossed waves displayed as if a symbol of the long tempest between Washington and Pyongyang, a capital laid waste by U.S.-led forces in the 1950-53 Korean war that turned back North Korea's invasion of the south while leaving the peninsula dangerously divided. Dinner was in front of another mural, this one of a pastoral scene. ``I believe that our meetings during these two days will help us to move further down the road of cooperation,'' Albright said in her toast, as Kim, a man whose words are rarely heard by outsiders, looked on impassively. Albright found one quick measure of common ground with North Koreans: their mutual fondness for pins. Many North Koreans wear pins showing their ``dear leader.'' Albright's splashy ones depicted an oversized U.S. flag and, for dinner, a heart. ``The United States understands that differences developed over many decades are real and cannot be eliminated overnight,'' Albright said. ``We must be pragmatic and recognize that the road to fully normal relations remains uphill.'' State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said the visit is historic but there are ``a lot of things that have to be discussed; a lot of issues that have to be dealt with.'' ``Being able to deal successfully with these issues is the key to having a successful visit by the president,'' he said. Of primary concern is North Korea's missile development program and its export of missiles to Iran and Syria. Albright raised such issues with Kim but officials said no agreements were expected. North Korea has been included on the U.S. list of states supporting international terrorism since January 1988, after North Korean agents bombed a South Korean airliner, KAL Flight 858, in November 1987, killing 115 people. South Korean officials welcomed the Albright trip. ``We must consider as desirable the North Korean moves to set up new relations with the outside world,'' said presidential spokesman Park Joon-young. The threat of war has hung over the Korean peninsula since the end of the war. About 37,000 American troops are stationed in South Korea. ``The U.S. government is very clear, as is the Republic of Korea, that American military forces need to remain in Korea even after there is a reduction in tension and even if there is reunification on the Korean peninsula,'' State Department official Morton Halperin said Monday during a visit to Canberra, Australia. He said, ``We need to remember that there is still a very serious North Korean military threat on the peninsula.'' The United States is considering creating a national missile defense, partly out of concern that North Korea may someday direct long-range missiles at American cities. ___ On the Net: State Department on Korea: http://www.state.gov/www/background_notes/north_korea_0696_bgn.html

American forces in Turkey and two small Persian Gulf states are on a heightened state of alert because of new indications of terrorist threats in the region, senior defense officials said Tuesday. One official, who discussed the matter on condition of anonymity, described the move as precautionary. ``The reason it was done was the receipt of specific threats against U.S. forces in those areas, but from sources whose credibility is unknown,'' the official said Monday in confirming a report first aired by CBS News. U.S. troops in Bahrain and Qatar in the Persian Gulf were placed on the highest possible state of alert, and the Incirlik air base in southern Turkey has been placed on the second-highest level of alert, the official said Tuesday. The change in Bahrain and Qatar was made over the weekend; Incirlik has been on a heightened level of alert for more than a week, the official said. Defense officials refused to discuss the nature of the threat that prompted the security concerns. Figuring in the decision to raise the alert level for troops in those three areas was the bombing Oct. 12 of the USS Cole, which was refueling in the Yemeni port of Aden when an explosion tore a hole in its hull. Seventeen sailors were killed and 39 were injured in what U.S. officials believe was the work of terrorists. Given the surprise attack on the Cole, ``this was thought to be the prudent thing to do,'' the official said. Bahrain is headquarters for the U.S. Central Command's naval forces and for the U.S. Navy's 5th Fleet. When the Cole was attacked, Central Command officials ordered all 5th Fleet ships out of port as a precaution against possible further attack, and they remained at sea last week. The Incirlik air base in Turkey is headquarters for the U.S. and British air patrols that are enforcing a ``no fly'' zone over northern Iraq. There is only a limited U.S. military presence in Qatar, with a small number of Air Force personnel stationed there. The United States also has an embassy in Qatar. Defense Secretary William Cohen said in response to the attack on the Cole that U.S. forces would not retreat from the region, whose oil supplies are vital to the American economy. Besides Turkey, Bahrain and Qatar, the United States maintains forces in several other areas of the Persian Gulf, including Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Oman. A U.S. aircraft carrier also is kept on permanent station in the Gulf. Army Gen. Tommy R. Franks, the commander in chief of Central Command, is due to testify before Congress on Wednesday _ along with other military and Defense Department officials _ on the Cole tragedy. American forces in the Persian Gulf region operate year-round under the threat of terrorism. In June 1996, a truck bomb ripped through a housing complex for U.S. Air Force personnel near Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, killing 19 Americans. ___ On the Net: U.S. Central Command: http://www.centcom.mil/ U.S. Navy 5th Fleet: http://www.centcom.mil/components/navcent_page.htm Operation Northern Watch: http://www.eucom.mil/operations/onw/index.htm Incirlik Air Base: http://www.incirlik.af.mil

With Secretary of State Madeleine Albright in the audience, dancers and gymnasts perfectly executed a 70-minute routine extolling North Korea's one-party socialist state and condemning imperialism. Albright's presence at the Monday night event was an anomaly, given her frequently stated passion for democracy. Totalitarian regimes drove her family from their Czech homeland twice during her childhood. Asked Tuesday how she felt making an official visit to an avowedly Stalinist state, Albright said, ``The glasses I have on are not rose-colored.'' Still, the Clinton administration's reaching out to Pyongyang while shunning all but the most circumscribed relations with Cuba is a contradiction that has not gone unnoticed in Havana. On the eve of Albright's trip here Monday, a Cuban diplomat in Washington mused about how the Clinton administration's relationship with Havana would change if Cuba possessed the kind of weapons that North Korea boasts. Indeed, Pyongyang has missiles which, when coupled with lethal warheads, are believed to be able to inflict mass destruction on large numbers of people in South Korea, Japan or even the United States itself. The perceived North Korean threat has given rise to demands among some influential U.S. groups for a national missile defense system capable of intercepting incoming missiles. President Clinton has deferred a decision on such a system to his successor. It is one of the more momentous national security decisions the new president will face. Beyond that, North Korea has shown a penchant for selling missiles and missile technology to Iran, Pakistan and Syria. As U.S. officials see it, this makes North Korea one of the world's most dangerous proliferators of weapons. So far from shunning North Korea because of its dictatorial ways, Albright has seemed almost eager to try to cut a deal with Pyongyang. She wants officials here to curb their missiles in exchange for economic help. And North Korea, faced with a steep economic decline, has shown a willingness to bargain. It has already agreed to a moratorium on long-range missile tests and both countries say they want to put an end to frictions that have haunted the relationship for decades. Cuba, in contrast, has no such leverage in its relationship with the United States. Economic weakness has enfeebled its once powerful military. And the Cuban exile community, although less of a political force than before, serves as a break on any potential overtures to Cuba by Washington. Mindful of this, both Vice President Al Gore and Texas Gov. George W. Bush say normal relations with Cuba will not be possible so long as the island does not embrace democracy. No such demands are made of North Korea. Ironically, the top adviser to North Korean leader Kim Jong Il met with Clinton on Oct. 10, the very day that Pyongyang reaffirmed its communist system with a mammoth military parade. The occasion was the 55th anniversary of the founding of the ruling Workers Party of Korea. The anniversary also was observed with a stunning gymnast display that served as a paean to the workers, soldiers, teachers and other heroes of the proletariat. The same performance was repeated Monday night, this time with Albright in attendance and Kim at her side. The performers, which included kindergarten-aged children, carried out their routines with precision. There was martial music and there were soldiers in camouflage outfits who dealt crushing blows with flailing fists and feet against supposed enemies. When the image of a missile was flashed across a screen, there was loud applause from the 100,000 present. At another point, electric beams formed the words ``Down with Imperialism Union,'' an anti-U.S. slogan. Its impact on Albright was muted because the message appeared in Korean. As for her penchant for not dealing with all dictatorial regimes the same way, Albright says, ``We do not have a cookie-cutter foreign policy.'' ___ EDITOR'S NOTE _ State Department correspondent George Gedda, who accompanied Secretary of State Madeleine Albright to North Korea, has reported on U.S.-Cuban relations for The Associated Press.

Security forces fired on demonstrators marching toward presidential offices Tuesday, after the junta leader declared himself the winner of controversial presidential elections. At least one person was killed. The crowd, which appeared to number at least 2,000, repeatedly regrouped at the scene, in downtown Abidjan a few blocks from the offices, after being dispersed by soldiers and military police firing machine guns and tear gas. Following a burst of gunfire, the body of a demonstrator lay in the street as clouds of tear gas wafted a part of the city that had been empty just moments before. Witnesses said at least four others were injured. The violence in Abidjan, the commercial capital of this West African country, came hours after junta leader Gen. Robert Guei dissolved the commission overseeing Sunday's presidential elections and declared himself the winner. The announcement set off opposition demonstrations that sent thousands swarming into the streets of Abidjan and other cities. The controversial vote was to decide the future of Ivory Coast, the world's largest cocoa producer, which saw its reputation as a bastion of regional calm destroyed in a December coup d'etat that brought Guei to power. Earlier Tuesday, security forces had fired weapons into the air as protesters converged in a number of Abidjan neighborhoods, including a mass of at least 2,000 demonstrators who chanted ``Guei step down!'' and tried to march into downtown. That group, escorted by a handful of military police who appeared to be supporting them, was also turned back by soldiers firing into the air. Furious over Guei's announcement, opposition leader Laurent Gbagbo also declared himself president and called on his supporters to protest the junta's move. ``I cannot let a country be dragged into the mud as Guei would like it,'' he told a crowd of cheering supporters at his campaign headquarters, in an Abidjan suburb. ``I ask that in all the cities of Ivory Coast and in every neighborhood Ivorians take to the streets.'' His supporters, though, had already begun to rally, moving into the streets within minutes of the announcement. Thousands, many wearing leaves as a sign of protest and tearing down any Guei campaign poster they came across, crowded neighborhoods across the city, setting up roadblocks of furniture, garbage and rocks. Clouds of black smoke could be seen rising in some areas. Daniel Bamba Sheik, director-general of the Interior Ministry's territorial administration department said Guei took 52.72 percent of last Sunday's vote against 41.02 for opposition leader Laurent Gbagbo. Bamba Sheik blamed massive fraud and the inability of electoral officials for the decision to disband the commission overseeing the vote. ``This commission, visibly lacking in experience ... instituted operational procedures for tabulating results that made the results unacceptable, causing, as was observed, mistakes and confusion,'' he said. He accused several parties, including Gbagbo's Ivorian Popular Front, of bussing voters from Abidjan to villages in the interior in order to vote twice. Bamba Sheik claimed that only 3.6 million voters had been registered for the vote, down from the 5.5 million announced by the commission prior to the ballot. Some 153,000 votes were nullified, he added. Electoral commission officials were not immediately available for comment and those seen earlier in the day were all escorted by armed security personnel and not allowed to talk to journalists. The vote was controversial from the beginning. The nation's two largest political parties boycotted the ballot after their leaders were barred from running by the Supreme Court. Gbagbo was the only political heavyweight allowed to run against the junta leader. Preliminary results released around midday Monday _ reflecting just a fraction of the vote _ showed Gbagbo with an edge over Guei. Since then, however, vote counting appeared to have stopped, European Union officials said speaking on condition of anonymity. A Gbagbo representative earlier asked Guei to accept defeat, repeating party claims that its own provisional count showed Gbagbo winning more than 60 percent of the vote. ``In developed countries, the loser recognizes his defeat ... even when the official results are not completely available,'' Gbagbo's campaign manager, Afi Nguessan, said. In an interview broadcast on Europe 1 radio, Gbagbo urged Guei to ``hand over power'' and said army soldiers were also advising the military ruler to do so. However, some soldiers, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Guei had given unspecified orders to troops late Monday to ``calm the population.'' Before vote counting was interrupted Monday, Gbagbo had 51.35 percent of the 126,683 ballots counted, compared to 40.40 percent for Guei, national electoral commission president Honore Guie said Monday. The preliminary figures accounted for a tiny fraction of the total possible vote from about 5.5 million registered voters. Gbagbo's party claimed its own count showed it leading with 61 percent to 25 percent for Guei with 1.1 million votes counted. On Monday, soldiers deployed throughout Abidjan after groups of jubilant Gbagbo (pronounced BAHG-bo) supporters paraded through the streets in parts of Abidjan and other cities. Soldiers used tear gas to break up a rally of Gbagbo demonstrators in the Riviera suburb. The United Nations, the Organization of African Unity, the European Union and countries such as the United States and Canada withdrew election observers or funding, saying the exclusion of major opponents made a free and fair election impossible.

the government said today it's going to cut back on the enormous number of people who descended on yemen to investigate the attack on the "uss cole." so many people from several agencies wanting to participate that the yemenis are feeling somewhat overwhelmed in their own country. investigats have come up with another theory on how the terrorists operated. abc's john miller on the house with a view. high on a hillside, in a run-down section of aden, the house with the blue door has a perfect view of the harbor. american and yemeni investigators believe that view is what convinced a man who used the name abdullah to rent the house several weeks before the bombing of the "uss cole." early on investigators theorized it was an inside job and much of the focus was on employees of the mansoon shipping company, which was under contract by the navy to refuel u.s. warships and would have had advance information about the "cole's" arrival. now the fbi believes all the terrorists needed to do was look out the window. to go through precisely the same drill, well before the "cole" arrived. the man in this house would have had plenty of time to signal two bombers waiting with the boat across the bay. investigators say clues collected over the last few days have already pointed them to locations both near and far outside the port city of aden. but they won't say there's any indication that the plot here goes beyond yemen's boarders. learning the true identities of those involved in the bombing would help answer that question, but the two suicide bombers died in the attack, and after the explosion, the man who lived behind the blue door simply vanished. john miller, abc news, aden.

let's go to north korea and the american secretary of state' groundbreaking trip to that country. madeleine albright paved the way for a possible visit there by president clinton. and also opened a door on a society long isolated from the rest of the world. andrea mitchell tonight reporting from the north korean capital pp. after six hours, north korea agrees to consider banning one of its most dangerous weapons -- a long range missile capable of striking the u.s. the first hint of a breakthrough comes last night when north korean leader kim jong il invites madeline albright to a massive propaganda rally incredibly one of the rally highlights the missile. and then this -- he immediately turned to me and quipped that this was the first satellite launch, and it would be the last. but can north korea be trusted? i can just assure you that these glasses that i have on are not rose colored. the warm reception albright has received here is in stark contrast to the grim life for most north koreans. even when we are permitted to go out, it is always with an escort. so it is very difficult to find out how people really live here in pyongyang. all we really know is that they do not have much food are very short on fuel, and their lives are closely regulated by their government. on the government tour we are only taken to monuments of the communist revolution. we set off on our own taking a small hand-held camera. what do we find? in a city of 2 million, there are very few people on the streets. a traffic guard with military precision directs traffic that isn't there. fuel is so scarce cars only for the privileged, few bicycles most people simply walk. the stores we visit have little to sell. people were afraid to talk to us. as albright and kim say good-bye at farewell dinner, she tells him to call anytime. he asks for her e-mail address! and her gift to this reclusive leader? an autographed michael jordan basketball. clearly, say u.s. officials, kim, an avid basketball fan, is a lot less isolated than his people. andrea mitchell, nbc news,

This is The World. I'm Lisa Mullins. In a year that's seen some unlikely events, the overthrow of Serbian strongman Slobodan Milosevic, the end of one-party rule in Mexico and other international shockers, what happened during the past two days in North Korea may have been the least likely of all. Secretary of State, Madeleine Albright met in the capital Pyong Yang with the leader of one of the world's last Communist states. Not only that, as The World's Clark Boyd reports, their talks were by and large friendly and constructive. When North Koreans turned on their radios this morning, they heard about something many thought impossible as little as two years ago, a meeting between Comrade Kim Jong Il and an American Secretary of State. For two countries still technically at war, this has been a historic get together. It's the first time a US Secretary of State has ventured on to North Korean soil. And it's the first time the reclusive Kim has met with a US official. North Korea pulled out all the stocks for this visit. Last night Kim and Albright sat side by side in a sports stadium in Pyong Yang as more than one hundred thousand singers, dancers and acrobats put on a huge spectacle extolling the virtues of the North Korean leader and his late father, Kim Il Sung. But the celebration contained a darker message, delivered when thousands of men in army uniform marched in step chanting, "We will safeguard our leader". One scene from the pageant was titled, "We will support our powerful nation with rifles". At one point a picture of the Taipu Don Missile flashed on the wall of the stadium, the Taipu missile that North Korea tested two years ago, sending waves of fear throughout Asia. But today Albright told reporters that Kim Jong Il picked that moment to ease her fears. He immediately turned to me and quipped that this was the first satellite launch and it would be the last. And Albright said she takes Kim Jong Il at his word. We have a moratorium on testing of all long-range missiles and we obviously are continuing these very serious missile discussions. Missiles were only one of the talking points in Pyong Yang during the past two days as both North Korea and the United States try to start normalizing their relations. For his part, Kim Jong Il would like to see his country removed from the US government's list of state sponsors of terrorism, a list North Korea has been on since the 1988 downing of a South Korean airliner. The North Koreans want off that list to make them eligible for World Bank loans and even foreign capital investment. But, says North Korea analyst Bill Taylor, of the Washington based Center for Strategic and International Studies, the Americans want some things too. We want a captive missile program, we want to verify that their nuclear program has been tapped since 1994, we want inspections to verify that and we want them to start selling missile and nuclear technology around the world to such countries as Iran and Syria and Libya. If the North Koreans agree to such demands, they'll want more oil, food and humanitarian aid in return. Taylor says it's a fair deal. It's going to cost us to get these agreements. But if you believe the statements made by Secretary Albright, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Yu Shoton , North Korea is the greatest threat to US interests anywhere in the world. It's worth it. Let's move. But with thousands of armed North Korean troops still on high alert along the border with South Korea, not to mention hundreds of surface to surface missiles and possibly biological and chemical weapons, some in Congress wonder whether President Kim's overtures are in good faith. California Republican, Dainer Rob Parker remains skeptical about opening up to North Korea. If you open up both sides of the bridge, it sounds like it's a good thing as long as tanks don't start rumbling across the bridge going south. Madeleine Albright certainly is trying to open up North Korea doing her job as a world representative for President Clinton, but President Clinton may be overly optimistic as to what can be accomplished with North Korea. Today President Clinton said he'll wait to hear Albright's report before deciding whether to visit North Korea as part of a trip to Asia next month. For The World , this is Clark Boyd.

In the cold and wind whipped waters of the Barents Sea, divers are trying to raise the bodies of 118 sailors from the wrecked Kursk. The nuclear submarine went down two months ago after two explosions ripped through it. Now Russian and Norwegian divers are making a man sized hole in the hull. That's the first step in bringing the remains of the crewmembers back to shore. The BBC's Steve Rosenberg is in Murmosk. Steve Rosenberg, where are they now in this salvage operation? How is it coming along? Well, the international team of deep-sea divers has made good progress today. Yesterday, if you remember, the weather was extremely bad. Storms, very high waves, very difficult conditions for the divers to work in. But the storm has cleared today and from this morning the divers have been down at the bottom of the Barents Sea, working on cutting out this hole in the inner hull of the Kursk. What happens once they do finish? Do they actually enter the submarine? How do they go about extracting the bodies of the submariners? Well, they won't enter straight away. First of all they have to make sure there are no jagged edges around this hole, because one tear of the protective suits of the divers could prove fatal. It is a very dangerous operation. Then they may send in a television camera, a remote controled television camera to have a look around and see what the conditions are like. And then, based upon the weather conditions, a decision will be made whether to go inside and begin the search for bodies. The weather is so vital because if the weather is stormy, if the winds are strong, then it makes it extremely dangerous for the Russian divers who will be going inside. The fear is that the umbilical cord linking the divers suits could get tangled, could get damaged, in that order of course, prove fatal. Are there also concerns regarding disrupting the nuclear fuel aboard the submarine? Are there any kind of environmental concerns? The Russian officials say there are no environmental concerns at the moment. A couple of days ago, a small hole was made in the inner hull of the Kursk and water samples were taken. They were tested and the results came back very encouraging. There was no hint of radiation or leaking fuel, anything like that. So I think officials are confident that it would be safe to go inside. But having said that, once inside there are a number of dangers, which would face the Russian divers. First of all, visibility will be very very low, it's going to be bitterly cold, and there is going to be enormous danger from jagged pieces of metal which could be swimming around in the submarine. Given the fact that there are so many dangers and that these divers are risking their own lives, I wonder if there is consideration given to the fact that this may not be really worth it. I mean have some suggested just leaving the sailors' bodies there and respecting the site as a grave? Yes, I have to say that more and more people in Russia are suggesting that this operation is not worth risking the lives of more people, risking the lives of the deep-sea divers. And in fact, many of the relatives of the crewmembers who died in this tragedy, they too are saying that the operation should be cancelled. Today many of the relatives met the Chief of the Russian Navy and suggested the same thing. But President Putin gave his word that the operation would go ahead, and it does seem as if the operation is going to continue. Are there any new explanations coming down as to what caused this disaster in the first place? Well, today the Chief of the Russian Navy, Vladimir Kuroyedov, he actually said he was eighty percent sure that the Kursk had collided with a submarine. I think so there has been no other official word, final word about what actually caused this tragedy. There is a government commission which was set up to investigate the causes of the tragedy, and they whittled out a number of possible causes to three. They have said that it was either a collision with a foreign submarine, it could have been a collision with a World War II mine, or it could have been a torpedo on board misfiring. They simply didn't know. But as I say, Admiral Koryerov has said he does believe it was a collision with a submarine. And they're not sure now whether it was a foreign submarine or a Russian one? The Chief of the Russian Navy didn't actually specify a foreign submarine, but certainly the Russian government has been suggesting all along that a foreign submarine was involved. The BBC's Steve Rosenberg speaking to us from Mermosk. Steve Rosenberg, thank you for the update. You're welcome.

Security forces fired on unarmed demonstrators in Ivory Coast on Tuesday, as thousands took to the streets after the military junta leader declared himself the winner of presidential elections intended to restore civilian rule. At least one person was killed. Waves of demonstrators wore blackened faces and leaves in their hair as signs of protest. They marched through otherwise deserted downtown Abidjan streets toward barricaded government offices, retreating when soldiers and military police fired machine guns and tear gas at them, then regrouping and surging forward again. The body of one demonstrator lay on the ground after a burst of gunfire as tear gas wafted over the streets. Witnesses said at least five others were injured. The clashes came hours after junta leader Gen. Robert Guei dissolved the commission overseeing Sunday's presidential elections _ in which he was a candidate _ and declared himself the winner. Furious over Guei's announcement, opposition leader Laurent Gbagbo also declared himself president and called on his supporters to protest the junta's move. ``I cannot let a country be dragged into the mud as Guei would like it,'' he told a crowd of cheering supporters at his campaign headquarters in an Abidjan suburb. ``I ask that in all the cities of Ivory Coast and in every neighborhood Ivorians take to the streets.'' His supporters, though, had already begun to rally, swarming into the streets of Abidjan and other cities within minutes of the junta announcement and tearing down any Guei campaign poster they came across. Tens of thousands of protesters set up roadblocks of furniture, rocks and burning tires in Abidjan's Riviera suburb as plumes of black smoke streaked across the sky. Soldiers in riot gear fired tear gas at the crowds, beating some youths with chains and iron bars. Two rioters were stripped naked and thrown into the back of a military jeep. On the outskirts of downtown, security forces fired weapons into the air to disperse at least 2,000 demonstrators chanting ``Guei step down!'' That group was escorted by a handful of military police who appeared to be supporting them. Thousands of Gbagbo's supporters also filled the streets in Guei's home town of Gagnoa, in western Ivory Coast, where demonstrators burned and looted the home of the junta leaders' local campaign manager and set fire to a Mercedes parked outside. ``We're demanding that Guei resign,'' said a local official with Gbagbo's Ivorian Popular Front who identified himself only as Yapi. ``Our supporters are ready to go head-to-head with the soldiers.'' But in Gagnoa, a Gbagbo stronghold, the soldiers did not intercede to stop the protests. The junta declared a state of emergency and a 9 p.m. to 6 a.m. curfew, in effect until Thursday. Daniel Bamba Sheik, a senior Interior Ministry official, blamed massive fraud and the inability of electoral officials for the decision to disband the commission overseeing Sunday's vote. ``This commission, visibly lacking in experience ... instituted operational procedures for tabulating results that made the results unacceptable, causing, as was observed, mistakes and confusion,'' he said. He accused unidentified parties of busing voters from Abidjan to villages in the interior in order to vote twice, saying such tactics necessitated the ``adjustment of the results to make them conform to the real vote expressed by our fellow citizens.'' Bamba Sheik said Guei took 52.72 percent of last Sunday's vote against 41.02 for Gbagbo, with three lesser known candidates sharing the remaining votes. He also claimed that only 3.6 million voters had been legally registered for the ballot, down from the 5.5 million announced by the commission before the ballot. Some 153,000 votes were nullified, he added. Gbagbo, however, declared he had 59.58 percent of the vote, compared to 32.91 percent for Guei. Neither claim could be independently verified. Electoral commission officials were not immediately available for comment, and those seen earlier in the day were all escorted by armed security personnel and not allowed to talk to journalists. The vote was controversial from the beginning. The nation's two largest political parties boycotted the ballot after their leaders were barred from running by the Supreme Court. Gbagbo (pronounced BAHG-bo) was the only political heavyweight allowed to run against the junta leader. Preliminary results released by the national electoral commission at midday Monday _ reflecting just a fraction of the vote _ showed Gbagbo with an edge over Guei. After that, however, vote counting appeared to have stopped, European Union observers said, speaking on condition of anonymity. Soon after, soldiers deployed throughout Abidjan after groups of jubilant Gbagbo supporters paraded through the streets in parts of the city declaring that he had won. The United Nations, the Organization of African Unity, the European Union and countries such as the United States and Canada withdrew election observers or funding before the vote, saying the exclusion of major opponents made a free and fair election impossible. Guei's move infuriated France, Ivory Coast's former colonial ruler, which still keeps hundreds of soldiers based in Abidjan. ``What we are seeing is an attempted coup,'' French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine said Tuesday. ``France will not accept it, the European union will not accept it, and there will be consequences.'' He did not elaborate. Ivory Coast saw its reputation as a bastion of regional calm destroyed in a December coup d'etat that brought Guei to power. The country's economy has also been battered by a steep decline in the prices of its main exports, coffee and cocoa. The instability has frightened Ivorians and foreign investors alike.

A RUMBLING IN CALIFORNIA The presidential race is tightening in California, the nation's biggest trove of electoral votes. In a newly released poll, Vice President Al Gore's once-formidable lead over Gov. George W. Bush has shrunk to just 5 percentage points. The survey, by the nonpartisan Public Policy Institute of California, conducted in the period spanning the second and third debates, found Gore leading 44 percent to 39 percent among likely voters, down from a nine-point lead in September. Gore's support slipped away to the Green Party candidate, Ralph Nader, who polled at 6 percent, and to other third-party candidates. But Bush's support stayed level, showing that he still faces an uphill battle in the Golden State. The poll numbers were enough to prompt one Nader supporter, Greg MacArthur of the group Citizens for Strategic Voting, to drop plans to run full-page ads in California newspapers claiming that a ``vote for Nader is not a vote for Bush.'' The group wants to run the ads only in states not in play, in hopes of winning enough total votes for Nader to reach the 5 percent national threshold needed to qualify the party for matching federal campaign funds in 2004. FLIP-FLOP IN WISCONSIN In another new poll, this one from Wisconsin, long considered a hotly contested state, Gov. George W. Bush has taken a 9-point lead over Vice-President Al Gore after trailing him by five points in a survey a month ago. The new poll, conducted last week by Harris Interactive of Rochester, N.Y., put support for Ralph Nader at 5 percent, up a point from the poll released a month earlier. THE CLINTON SHADOW Should President Clinton campaign with Vice President Al Gore? ``No'' was the resounding answer Monday night from most of a dozen people at a focus group in Marlton, N.J. Even voters who were Democrats and had favorable opinions of Clinton told the focus-group pollster, Peter Hart, that the president should steer clear of the Gore campaign. A Gallup Poll released Tuesday affirmed this view. Voters were asked if they would be more likely or less likely to vote for Gore if Clinton campaigned with him. Forty percent said ``less likely,'' while only 17 percent said ``more likely.'' Gov. George W. Bush seems to relish the idea of Clinton appearing with Gore. ``If he can't help himself and starts getting out there and campaigns against me, the shadow returns,'' Bush said. PRAISE FOR GOVERNOR'S WIDOW The new governor of Missouri, Roger Wilson, said Tuesday that he would be willing to appoint Jean Carnahan, the widow of Gov. Mel Carnahan, as senator should the late governor receive more votes than Sen. John Ashcroft in the Nov. 7 election. Carnahan, a Democrat, was killed last week in a plane crash while campaigning to unseat Ashcroft, a Republican. But voters will find his name still on the ballot on Election Day because his death occurred after the deadline for inserting substitutes. After the crash, many Missouri Democrats began urging Wilson, himself a Democrat and Carnahan's lieutenant governor, to state his willingness to appoint Mrs. Carnahan to serve should her husband end up winning. Wilson had high praise for Mrs. Carnahan but said he was unsure where she stood on serving because she had indicated that holding public office ``was certainly not a decision she was ready to make at this time.'' THE TRAVEL LOG Here are the stats for Tuesday: Length of official day: Gore, 13 hours; Bush 14 1/2 hours Official Events: Gore, 4; Bush 3 Cities/towns visited: Gore, 3 (Little Rock, Ark.; Shreveport, La.; Nashville, Tenn.)

China marked the 50th anniversary Wednesday of its entrance into the Korean War with patriotic tributes to those who died and praise for ``long overdue'' peace overtures between the conflict's former enemies. Members of the ruling Communist Party's inner circle took part in somber ceremonies in Beijing and the North Korean capital of Pyongyang _ evidence of the ties forged fighting South Korean and U.S.-led forces in the 1950-53 conflict. But the ceremonies carried traces of changes afoot in the region. Defense Minister Chi Haotian, himself a Korean War veteran, stood with North Korean leader Kim Jong Il in May 1st Stadium _ where Kim entertained U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright two days earlier. This time, instead of costumed, dancing children, the stadium was a sea of green-uniformed soldiers, footage on Chinese state television showed. In Beijing's Great Hall of the People, President Jiang Zemin urged Chinese seeking to build the country into a new power to draw inspiration from the sacrifices made by China's ``volunteer'' army in Korea. ``To the very end, the volunteer officers and men placed the motherland's and the people's interests above everything else,'' Jiang said addressing the communist elite, among them aged veterans with strings of medals hanging from Mao suits. ``That spirit will always be the precious riches of the Chinese people.'' Jiang mentioned the valiant fight against ``American aggression'' during the Korean War. But Beijing has in recent years used its influence to push North Korea toward reconciliation with former foes South Korea and the United States. China, the only major power to have good relations with both Koreas, welcomed the June summit between the leaders of the two Koreas, Albright's visit to North Korea and announcements last week that Britain, Germany, Spain and Belgium will normalize relations with North Korea. ``The world is witnessing a long overdue thaw of relations,'' the China Daily said. ``All such positive developments are well received in China because peaceful reunification of the Korean Peninsula and permanent peace there are exactly what our heroes and heroines fought for half a century ago.'' China Daily and articles and editorials in state-run newspapers said that war's economic cost and loss of 140,000 Chinese lives were worthwhile. The Korean War ``tells us that for a country to stand up among the world's people, to not be humiliated and to receive respect it must develop production and increase its overall strength,'' the Communist Party's flagship newspaper, People's Daily, said in a front-page editorial. Wednesday marked the day 50 years ago when China, mustering its forces in North Korea in secret for weeks, opened skirmishes against U.S., South Korean and other allied forces. The surprise Chinese campaign pushed the allies back, laying the ground for a protracted war that ended three years later with no peace treaty.

Here are excerpts from editorials in newspapers in the United States and abroad: Oct. 19 The Akron (Ohio) Beacon Journal, on Al Gore's style: The three presidential debates were supposed to serve Al Gore. George W. Bush would be overmatched, or so the conventional wisdom went. In each, Gore had the greater command of issues, the more cogent arguments for his cause. On Oct. 17, in St. Louis, Gore delivered his strongest performance. He also offered a reminder. Style plays an indispensable role. The vice president has no trouble dissecting the nuances of programs and policies. He isn't as adept at telling the larger story, at defining themes that resonate with an audience. In that sense, the debates didn't serve him well. They presented an opportunity, and he missed. What has really hampered Gore is his campaign style. It appears so awkwardly contrived. Oct. 20 The Beaufort (S.C.) Gazette, on Congress spending the surplus: While Al Gore and George W. Bush are running around the nation telling voters how they are going to dispose of the surplus, members of Congress are sitting in Washington making sure there will be very little surplus to dispose of. Published estimates by both Republicans and Democrats have it that this year's new programs will reduce the surplus over the next 10 years by somewhere between $800 billion and $900 billion, roughly a third of the surplus that had been projected. That alone grinds the plans of Gore and Bush into so much baloney, although neither will likely acknowledge as much, seeing as how they would then have to revise their whole campaigns. There are two points here that ought to cause some discomfort to people in our great democracy. One is that you cannot put money in front of Congress in an election year without it being slurped up like slop in a hog trough. The other is, both of the candidates' major pledges to the voters will have been based on a demonstrably false premise. Oct. 21 Fresno (Calif.) Bee, on the presidential nominees' budget surplus ``fuzzy math'': The big issue in next month's election, the presidential candidates reminded us in ... (their) final debate, is how to use the federal budget surplus. The question they didn't answer, or get asked, is an even bigger one: What budget surplus? In their eagerness to offer the voters election-year goodies _ tax cuts here, new Medicare benefits there _ both Al Gore and George W. Bush have bought into the fuzziest math of all: the way the federal government figures its books. ... If Washington takes in more than it spends, it calls that amount a surplus, which politicians line up to spend or rebate as a tax cut. But by any real-world accounting, most of that ``surplus'' is an illusion. ... When economists William Gale of the Brookings Institution and Alan J. Auerbach of UC Berkeley, using standard accounting and realistic assumptions, recently refigured that 10-year, $4.6-trillion surplus Bush and Gore like to talk about, it dwindled to $1.2 billion. But the candidates continue to pretend otherwise. ... Saving the surplus today against the demographic storms of tomorrow is the only way to make that challenge less wrenching. Gore promises more goodies than he can prudently deliver, but at least he sees the cloud. Bush would lead the country into the squall without a raincoat or boots. Deseret News, Salt Lake City, on the cost of a college degree: The price of a four-year college degree continues to rise faster than inflation, with tuition and fees at public colleges and universities up an average of 4.4 percent over the previous year and even more at private schools. Colleges and universities have large fixed costs in terms of personnel and facilities. Their budgets are further challenged by unfunded federal mandates that cover everything from access for people with disabilities to ``hazardous waste'' disposal. Colleges and universities are further hamstrung by the sharp increases in the cost of lab supplies and library materials. For the most part, college is affordable and a sound investment. Because parents and students themselves can predict with near certainty that costs will continue to escalate, the wisest course is to start saving for college when children are babies and seek out investment vehicles that offer flexibility and low costs. Beyond that, the regents and trustees who oversee these institutions must guard against pricing students out of college. ... According to some experts, college costs have exceeded inflation most of the 20th century. Yet, a growing number of people appreciate the value of higher education and are enrolling in state and private institutions. ... Thus far, the goal of a college diploma remains in reach of most Americans. Sensible public policy and wise personal investment should help ensure that continues to be the case. Oct. 19 Chicago Sun-Times, on America should always be ready to protect itself: Today's volunteer military is sold to young men and women as an exciting job choice. But one needed only look to Norfolk, Va., Wednesday to find that military service is not just another way to earn a paycheck. Under an appropriately gray sky, taps was played during a memorial service for the 17 sailors killed in the terrorist attack on the USS Cole in Yemen. President Clinton and others pledged to find the terrorists who murdered these American sailors, a vow solid in its intentions but not easily kept. That is not to say we are powerless against terrorism, and an investigation into the Cole attack may reveal how this particular catastrophe could have been avoided. Why was Yemen, a poor country described by the State Department as ``a safe haven for terrorists,'' chosen to be a refueling site? Chief of operations Adm. Vernon Clark's answer was frank but disturbing: ``Diplomacy was at the heart of the motivation.'' By bringing ships into the port at Aden, the United States hoped to find favor with Yemen. The Cole was on heightened alert when it entered the port, but suicide bombers aboard a small boat may have infiltrated the port operations crews or the contractor hired to re-fuel American ships in Yemen. Security precautions involving private contractors indicate a curiously lax attitude: Employees are not properly scrutinized and work boats are not searched. U.S. intelligence efforts also appear to have failed, as some witnesses report that there seemed to be a panicky rush by other ships and port personnel away from the Cole in the moments before the explosion. The ship's commanders had notified Yemeni authorities some 10 days of their intention to refuel in Aden. At the Norfolk Naval Station, Defense Secretary William Cohen called the attack an ``act of pure evil'' by terrorists. ``Death snatched them away in one violent, unsuspecting moment, while they were making sure America and its friends slept easily in a dangerous world,'' he said. Dangerous world _ that's a fact in 2000. But the ``unsuspecting moment'' _ that's a particularly troubling observation. Oct. 23 Alamogordo (N.M.) Daily News, on risks taken by American military personnel: Last week's bombing of the USS Cole sent home a reminder often overlooked or taken for granted when the United States is not in the middle of a declared war. All over the globe, 24 hours a day, American soldiers, sailors and airmen are fighting for and protecting this great nation. Seventeen sailors died in what was to be a routine refueling in the Gulf of Aden along the coast of Yemen. It is believed it was a terrorist suicide bombing. But for the grace of God, it could just as easily have been 17 airmen from our own Holloman Air Force Base, performing a routine task, and suffering the ultimate fate. Everyone who puts on the uniform knows this is a possibility. Yet they march forward and take the risk. They put everything on the line for the rest of us. For their families. For their country. For our way of life. ... But there's no way to really say ``Thank you'' for what these men and women do for us. It all seems so arbitrary. Some soldiers can spend more than 20 years in service, fighting in the heat of battle many times, without getting a scratch. Others can spend just a short tenure, during what is supposed to be peacetime, and make the supreme sacrifice. What drives people to join the service today is not as clear as it was Dec. 8, 1941, the day after Pearl Harbor. But still, every soldier, sailor or airman knows the potential consequences. And they still make the commitment. ... It takes every person in our armed forces to provide for the common defense. And we owe every one of them a debt. Our gratitude cannot be expressed. Oct. 24 The Galveston County (Texas) Daily News, on sending aid overseas for family planning: Buried in a huge bill now being debated in Washington is a measure that would save the lives of thousands of women next year. Congress is considering legislation that would provide funds for family planning services in foreign countries. We live in a world where 600,000 women die each year during pregnancy or in childbirth. They die because they lack basic care _ and in some cases basic information. That information would save thousands of lives. However, this legislation, which is part of the Foreign Operations Appropriations bill for fiscal 2001, is controversial. Abortion opponents have inserted a rule that would prohibit any foreign organization that either provides abortion services or lobbies for abortion laws from getting the funds. The restriction against people who use their right of free speech to lobby for a position is particularly troubling. The rule seeks to impose a restriction on free speech on foreigners that could not, under the Bill of Rights, be imposed on U.S. citizens. It's an unfortunate message to be sending to developing countries, particularly in an age where AIDS makes risky the lack of information on reproduction. Oct. 23 The Jordan Times, Amman, on the emergency Arab summit: No one expected Arab leaders at the end of their emergency Arab summit aimed at making Israel pay a diplomatic price for its 25-day-old crackdown on the Palestinians to come up with more than the modest, but strongly-worded communique they produced. The outcome of the summit surely did not satisfy angry Arab demonstrators who demanded a cut in ties with Israel and called for jihad to support the Palestinian intifadeh, but it might have succeeded in returning the peace ball back into Israel's court. But what pains us most is Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak's determination to bring about the formal death of peace by calling for the formation of a national emergency cabinet with hard-liners opposed to peace with the Palestinians. However, we are hopeful that their decision to hold an annual Arab summit every March, instead of waiting in vain for years to get together, might be the start of a realistic and gradual approach that enables them to put their rivalries aside and think of their long-term survival as one bloc in a changing world. And until the summit meets in Amman in five months from now, Israel would have had ample time to decide whether it wants to play the drums of war or the tunes of peace. Oct. 22 The Financial Times, London, on the presidential race: The U.S. election campaign has entered the final stretch with George W. Bush, the Republican candidate, acting as though he senses a presidential victory that, a month ago, looked on the unlikely side of possible. Mr. Bush seems to have decided that low-risk generalities and a winning smile are enough for the electorate, while Vice President Al Gore has gone on the attack, having realized that the magic ingredient called momentum has disappeared. The striking characteristic of the campaign over the past couple of weeks has been the diminishing importance of detail. There has been no lack of specifics in the U.S. media's coverage ... but there is still an overwhelming sense in much U.S. commentary that personal likes (and dislikes) will decide this election. The sudden shifts in momentum during this election, which is still too close to call, have generally come when the front-runner has presumed that victory is within grasp, and the laggard has made an extra effort to bridge the gap. If Mr. Bush continues to provide a paucity of detail and bases the final days of campaigning on a perceived fear of Big Government, he may find that he does not get the chance to preside over a smaller U.S. government. Oct. 24 Bangkok (Thailand) Post, on Madeleine Albright's visit to Pyongyang: As the West rushes to Pyongyang, it rests with U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright to be both a pioneer and pragmatist. Mrs. Albright appears to recognize both the opportunity and danger. All nations must welcome the effort by Pyongyang to come out of its long isolation. At the same time, they must ensure that North Korea takes the necessary steps to change some of its unacceptable behavior ... President Kim Jong-Il should take immediate steps to renounce and halt his nation's terrorist and secret weapons program. North Korea needs, and deserves, aid to help its people. It does not deserve aid to help it maintain destructive and terrorist weapons programs. Oct. 25 Svenska Dagbladet, Stockholm, Sweden, on Yugoslavia: Time is running out for (former Yugoslav President) Slobodan Milosevic. The long arm of the law will reach him. If Milosevic is not sent to the U.N. war crimes tribunal in The Hague (Netherlands) there will be a trial in Belgrade. Justice will be done, and the victims will obtain redress. Since the autumn miracle in Yugoslavia, which led to Vojislav Kostunica being sworn in as president and developments took a new path, Milosevic's future has been an open question. The U.S. and the EU have pressed to get him extradited to The Hague. Kostunica has been reticent. Milosevic has been able to move around without restrictions. In an American TV interview Kostunica says that Milosevic will stand trial, 'somewhere.' Thereby another big step toward normalization of Yugoslavia is taken. But Kostunica went further than that in the CBS interview. He admitted that Yugoslav security forces had committed genocide in Kosovo _ and that he was prepared to take responsibility for this. The statement is important to get the Serbs to see the reality behind the smoke screens laid out by Milosevic; a time of soul-searching must come. That Kostunica makes things plain also has a bearing on the relations with the Kosovo Albanians and with those of the neighboring countries who have doubted the intentions of the new regime. Another question mark about the new president's politics has been wiped clean. Vojislav Kostunica continues to impress. Oct. 25 24 Heures, Lausanne, Switzerland, on cyclist admitting he took performance-enhancing drugs: So Richard Virenque has finally broken, giving in to the pressure of a truth which had become undeniable. The king of the mountains is naked: he has only his eyes to cry over the past. More than two years of brazen lying can be added to the tarnished picture of four years of cheating with no aim but a short-lived vainglory. ... But what really counts here is that yet another ray of light has been shed on the vast nebula of doping _ in cycling in particular and in sport in general. Yet again it is clear that to be at the front of the peloton, vitamins were not enough. ... Has the page finally been turned in this bad soap opera? Anyone who thinks so is naive. We are on to a new stage, and there will be others. But the road that leads to a Tour de France completely without cheating is still long. And that's provided that we are not condemned to start it again and again, like Sisyphus pushing a stone up a hill and then watching it roll down again. Oct. 24 Le Figaro, Paris, on the sale of potentially infected beef: The discovery this weekend of a ton of beef potentially contaminated with mad cow disease and sold by a large distributor shouldn't sow panic. But we would also be wrong to take it too lightly. ... No one is arguing about Carrefour supermarket chain's attention to sanitary security. The speed of its reaction shows that. But what is most worrying about the problem is that such a group, with very organized purchasing services, could be the victim of such a fraud. This is what leaves the consumer stunned and arouses suspicion about all buying of beef. ... Until now, the government has chosen the half-measure, keeping from completely banning English beef and putting in place surveillance measures in France which seem incoherent to most specialists. ... In wanting to both reassure the population and protect French breeders, all the while risking boycott by increasingly skeptical consumers, Jean Glavany (Minister of Agriculture) risks losing on both points. He will certainly have a hard time in the months to come to convince us that the more mad cow cases are detected, the less risk of epidemic there is. Oct. 25 La Repubblica, Rome, on Yugoslavian President Vojslav Kostunica: In an act of extraordinary ethical and political significance, Yugoslav President Vojslav Kostunica affirmed that Slobodan Milosevic's police committed crimes against humanity in Kosovo, and that as a Serb, he feels responsibility for those massacres committed by his predecessor's regime. There will never be peace in the former Yugoslavia unless the parties agree on a common history in which each main actor admits guilt and takes the blame. Kostunica took the first step. Serbia will have to walk this road with the courage and honesty of its new president. But so too must Croatia, and the Albanians of Kosovo, whose ethnic nationalism is not essentially different from that of others. Each of these peoples has been both victim and victimizer, although to different degrees. Kostunica made the admission of guilt in an interview to a major American network, and the choice does not seem to be accidental. While he has won the European Union's trust, the United States is more suspicious of the nationalist notoriety that has accompanied him. It was precisely this view that Kostunica tried to dispel. Oct. 22 Mainichi Shimbun, Tokyo, on Japan's plan to sign free-trade agreements with Singapore: Japan, a latecomer to the free trade agreements movement, expects to sign its first free trade treaty with Singapore by mid-2001. Until now, Japan has adopted a cautious approach toward FTAs, and for too long has insisted that multilateral talks within the World Trade Organization should serve as the basis of its trade policy. But the shortcomings of the WTO framework were laid bare at the disastrous meeting in Seattle last year. Japan's FTA with Singapore will likely serve as a model for future agreements with other countries such as Mexico, South Korea, and Chile. ... And Japanese business leaders have begun to exhibit enthusiasm for an FTA with Japan's largest trading partner, the United States. The status of agricultural products is likely to emerge as a sticking point when Japan negotiates FTAs. But we must not forget that various countries have overcome difficult trade issues to sign FTAs which have contributed to the structural reform of their domestic industries. The 120 FTAs which have already been signed around the world are proof that these agreements play a role in promoting structural reform.

A Yemeni carpenter now in detention helped two men modify a small boat to carry explosives, sources said Wednesday, as investigators increasingly turn their attention to the network the bombers used to plan and carry out the attack on the USS Cole. The Yemeni sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said authorities also have detained a woman who bought the car they used to haul the boat. The sources said charges had not yet been filed in either case. The carpenter confessed Tuesday that he had helped two men modify a small boat to carry explosives and then helped them load the explosives into the boat. It was not immediately clear if the man knew what the two planned to do with the bomb-laden boat. He was not named. Officials believe two suicide bombers maneuvered a small boat next to the Cole and detonated it on Oct. 12, killing 17 U.S. sailors and injuring 39. The carpenter had rented the men the Aden house they used to work on the boat, the sources said. They said he had been detained since a day after the bombing, but only provided details of his involvement Tuesday. The two men have not been seen since shortly before the bombing and their identities and nationality were unknown. Also Wednesday, security officials in Taiz, northwest of Aden, said they had detained a woman who confessed the men gave her money to buy a car in her name that they used to haul their boat to shore. The woman was identified only as a Somali. No other details were immediately available. Yemeni investigators have increasingly turned their attention to the network the bombers used to plan and carry out the attack. If terrorism is proved, the Cole bombing would be the deadliest terrorist attack on the U.S. military since 19 Air Force personnel died in a 1996 truck-bomb explosion in Saudi Arabia. A U.S. official, meanwhile, slightly altered the account of conditions at the time of the bombing. A senior U.S. official said on condition of anonymity Wednesday that the Cole was in the third-highest state of alert when it entered the port Oct. 12. The Navy had earlier said the Cole and its crew were at the second-highest level. Ships normally enter Aden at the third-highest level, known as bravo, and there was apparently no reason to suspect Oct. 12 would be out of the ordinary. At bravo, a number of rifle-toting sailors would have been keeping a watchful eye on the area from stations on the ship's deck. At the next highest level, a security boat might have accompanied the Cole, among other measures. The U.S. Navy five days ago had altered its account of events leading to the bombing, saying earlier statements were based on initial reports from the ship that were either wrong or were misunderstood by Pentagon officials.

good evening. we begin tonight with what u.s. intelligence says was a coordinated plan to attack u.s. forces overseas in several places in which the "uss cole" was only one target. that's the reason we're told today that u.s. forces in the gulf and turkey were put on such a high state of alert. abc's john m wethy is at the pentagon with the details. some of the strongest intelligence that the u.s. has about possible attacks was in bahrain, the small gulf nation that's been so cooperative to the u.s. efforts in that area and where the u.s. fleet has its headquarters. intelligence sources say what drove american forces in bahrain to the highest state of aler was discovy of a plan for a suicide bomber to drive a vehicle loaded with explosives on to the runway underneath an american aircraft and blow it up. other intelligence indicated attacks on the american embassy there and the international school, attended by many american children. intelligence sources say threats to the american embassy in nearby qatar and to the air force base used by american fighter jets in incerlik, turkey, may have all been part of a calculated pattern leading back to the "uss cole." though american officials insist that they do not yet know who was responsible for the attack on the "cole," intelligence sources tell abc news that investigators have little doubt that terrorist leader osama bin laden was behind it, that he financed it and sent one of his top people to organize it. "the u.s. could not yet prove it in court," one official said, "but the evidence is compelling." the president of yemen seemed to be pointing toward bin laden when he told report thaerz all those he detain ready associated with a radical islamic group that does training in afghanistan. that's where bin laden runs his operation. american officials are concerned about what they are seeing, the complexity. they are convinced there are other terrorist cells out there waiting to do what they had been planning. john m wethy at pentagon this evening.

As columns of black smoke rose across the city, tens of thousands of Ivoirians poured into chaotic streets Wednesday and converged on the center of Abidjan, proclaiming that they had overthrown Gen. Robert Guei one day after he declared himself the winner of the disputed presidential election. The whereabouts of Guei, who seized power in a Christmas-eve coup last year in one of the few African countries never to have had experienced military rule, remained unclear Wednesday night. Soldiers and the security forces who turned against the general on Wednesday did not find him in the presidential palace here. With the popular revolt, a fierce political battle now looms before the country. The general's main opponent in Sunday's election, Laurent Gbagbo, declared himself president Wednesday, and on state television Wednesday night the army chief of staff, Gen. Soumaila Diabakate, said the armed forces were now behind Gbagbo. But at least one of the main political parties said it would not recognize the results and called for a new election. The balloting Sunday, which many Ivoirians and Western nations considered deeply flawed, excluded major party candidates and was boycotted by large portions of the population. Nevertheless, a 10-month-long period of military dictatorship in this former French colony appeared to have reached its end, raising the possibility that the Ivory Coast might reassume its traditional role as an economic and political anchor for the region. In what quickly became one of the first times a popular uprising in support of democratic process had dislodged a dictator in Africa, residents of the West African nation on Wednesday pushed through military barricades erected around the city center and the presidential palace. The protesters, many marching in flip-flops, were unarmed. Many painted their faces white and wore twigs and leaves around their foreheads in a symbolic gesture of protection. Soldiers loyal to Guei (pronounced gay) fired into the air and then into the crowds. But other soldiers stood, arms crossed, in front of a military barracks, and eventually the paramilitary gendarmes joined the civilians in opposing the military regime. Most soldiers could be seen siding with protesters or remaining neutral. Gbagbo's party said 60 people had been killed in violence since Tuesday. ``The mistake Guei made was to let us watch scenes from Belgrade,'' said Alfred Tohouri, a 31-year-old student, referring to the fall of Slobodan Milosevic after a contested election in Yugoslavia, as he made his way through the thick crowds standing Wednesday morning in front of a tank in the city center. ``Ah!'' he added. ``The people have stood up like one man. We have been marginalized too long, lied to too often.'' Half an hour later, scores of gendarmes wrested away the state television building from loyalist soldiers, an event that also echoed the Serb revolt. ``The TV station has been freed!'' a civilian shouted into his cell phone, near the building, as the crackle of automatic gunfire made him duck. A truck filled with heavily armed gendarmes rumbled toward the station, cheered on by onlookers who reached up to shake their hands. In front of the television building, scores of protesters tore down a shack that had been used by the soldiers and then danced on its crumpled aluminum roof. ``We are free!'' shouted Hermann Karamo, one of the protesters. ``It's freedom for the Ivory Coast!'' Then just before 1 p.m., Gbagbo, the opposition leader who had been leading in the ballot tally before Guei canceled the vote-counting on Tuesday, appeared on state television. ``The Ivory Coast could not accept this electoral coup d'etat,'' Gbagbo said in a four-minute speech in which he declared himself the country's new president. ``That is why I called on you to resist.'' Gbagbo said he now controlled the military, called for national reconciliation and said he would soon form a new government. Across Abidjan Wednesday afternoon, people held their fingers up in ``V'' signs for victory. Despite the euphoria, many questions remained unanswered as night fell. Guei was reported to have fled to nearby Benin with his family. But then the army chief of staff, Diabakate, told journalists that Guei was still in the presidential palace. Diabakate seemed to accept the reality of the popular uprising. He called on all soldiers to return to the barracks, telling Ivoirians that ``the armies of the Ivory Coast have heard you.'' Politically, the country remained as divided as ever, and there were no signs Wednesday night that Gbagbo's declaration of winning the presidency or his call for reconciliation would be heeded. Gbagbo's party, the Ivoirian Popular Front, is the country's third largest party, behind the Democratic Party of the Ivory Coast and the Rally of the Republicans _ both of which were excluded from Sunday's election. ``We must hold another election with the participation of all the candidates,'' said Ali Coulibaly, the spokesman for the Rally of the Republicans, in a telephone interview on Wednesday. ``Guei proclaimed himself president yesterday, and Gbagbo proclaimed himself president today. The president of the country must be chosen by the people.'' Members of the Rally of the Republicans marched here and through the northern cities of Bouake and Korhogo late Wednesday afternoon, calling for a new election. The party's candidate, Alassane D. Ouattara, a former prime minister and a former deputy managing director of the International Monetary Fund in Washington, was disqualified from running in Sunday's election by a court controlled by Guei. A reconciliation between Ouattara and Gbagbo will be particularly difficult. Onetime allies, Gbagbo turned against Ouattara last year, adopting a xenophobic platform aimed at rallying Christian southerners like himself against Muslim northerners like Ouattara. About 40 percent of the Ivory Coast's population is Muslim, and most of them boycotted Sunday's election _ whose two major candidates and three minor ones were Christian southerners. The court also eliminated the candidate of the Democratic Party of the Ivory Coast, whose officials had earlier rejected Guei's attempt to become its candidate. Western nations condemned the court's verdict, withdrawing financial support from the elections, which they called illegitimate. The two major Ivoirian parties boycotted Sunday's election, and turnout appeared very low. On Tuesday, after preliminary results showed that Guei was trailing Gbagbo, the junta dissolved the National Electoral Commission and the general declared himself the winner. The announcement immediately sent protesters to the streets. Soldiers loyal to Guei clashed with other soldiers inside a military camp on the outskirts of Abidjan. Heavy firing could be heard from the camp until the predawn hours Wednesday. As soon as the sun rose Wednesday morning, tens of thousands of ordinary Ivoirians began marching from working-class neighborhoods surrounding the city center. In lines stretching several miles, the demonstrators moved through avenues littered with broken vending-stands, burnt cars and burning tires. Supporters of Gbagbo were joined by Ivoirians from the north and other ethnic regions. The crowds moved forward, turning back when soldiers fired. ``They fired in the air first, and when we didn't turn back, they fired at us,'' said Roland Degre, a marcher who was running away from the city center in a large crowd. ``Guei fired on us.'' Another marcher, Alain Djahouri, said: ``Two people were killed. They shot one in the face. They shot another in the chest.'' And yet despite those two deaths, as well as the deaths of others Wednesday, the crowds kept surging forward toward the city center. At a spot not too far from the presidential palace, thousands of marchers were stopped at a barricade beyond which soldiers waited in a tank. ``I'm here because I have two sons in their 30s who are sitting at home with no future in this country,'' said Jean-Yves LePrince, a grey-bearded 51-year-old. ``I'm here for them. We must take back this country.''

Ivory Coast's army has pledged its loyalty to opposition candidate Loran Gbagbo. The pledge followed a tumultuous 24 hours that ended the rule of the Hunta, which seized power last December. Soldiers and civilians took to the streets to celebrate the departure of Hunta leader General Robert Guei. In an address on state television, Wednesday, Mr. Gbagbo, leader of the Ivorian Socialist party said he would be forming a cabinet shortly.

Ethnic and political street battles erupted Thursday in Abidjan, as angry supporters of Ivory Coast's new leader fought followers of a rival politician with clubs and machetes. Less than a day after former opposition leader Laurent Gbagbo was swept to power by massive demonstrations, neighborhoods across this coastal city were wracked with violence by militants calling for new presidential elections. At least three people were burned to death, according to a witness who did not want to be named, and three mosques were torched. Many Muslim residents were fleeing the working-class neighborhood of Yopougon with their possessions. At least one church was burned in a different section of town. Supporters of Ivory Coast's most popular opposition figure, Alassane Dramane Ouattara _ most of them Muslims from northern-based tribes _ were fighting Gbagbo's backers, who are mostly Christians from southern ethnic groups. ``People are dying,'' said Aida Diallo, who was fleeing a burning neighborhood to get to her family's home, her belongings tied into a cloth sack. ``I'm scared, so scared.'' Witnesses said Gbagbo supporters and security forces had tried to advance on Ouattara's compound in a wealthy Abidjan suburb Wednesday morning, but had been pushed back by crowds of supporters who have kept the house surrounded for weeks. An official with Ouattara's party said two militants were wounded in the attack and 14 supporters were killed during fighting in Abidjan's Abobo neighborhood. That could not be independently confirmed. Officials with Gbagbo's party said an unknown number of their supporters had been killed. Mobs of people _ some of them numbering in the thousands _ could be seen forming in various neighborhoods. Paramilitary police firing tear gas broke up a number of those gatherings. Ouattara's supporters are demanding that new presidential elections be held in this West African nation. Ouattara was excluded from Sunday's presidential vote, which now-ousted junta leader Gen. Robert Guei claimed to have won. Guei quickly saw power slip from his grasp as Gbagbo's supporters _ who also claimed victory _ swarmed the streets. Guei's downfall came Wednesday after security forces joined the demonstrators, and he is reported to have fled to nearby Benin. Black smoke from burning tires billowed above Abidjan neighborhoods where Ouattara's backers had blocked the streets. In the western city of Gagnoa, police clashed with pro-Ouattara demonstrators while in Ouattara's northern stronghold of Korhogo, his supporters were burning opponents' houses. On a street corner in Abidjan's posh Cocody suburb, young men with white stripes painted on their faces _ some of them carrying nail-studded sticks or machetes _ gathered on a street corner, calling themselves ``real Ivorians'' and threatening to kill Ouattara. Gbagbo's party, the Ivorian Popular Front, ruled out sharing power with Ouattara's Rally of the Republicans or holding new elections. ``We cannot associate with a movement that is behind illegal protests,'' said party official Nguessan Afi _ whose leader had called for protests one day earlier. ``We want a well-organized, peaceful state that is ruled by law.'' He said the opposition had a right to protest but should seek remedies to their grievances in legislative and municipal elections. ``In Ivory Coast, parties were excluded from the ballot,'' he said. ``But we have a responsibility to respect the laws of our country. President Gbagbo is the leader of the party with the largest following in the elections, that is clear.'' But the election Sunday was problematic from the start. Ivory Coast's two largest parties _ Ouattara's and the former ruling Democratic Party _ boycotted the vote after their candidates were excluded from running by the Supreme Court. ``The great majority of the people of Ivory Coast were excluded from these elections, and this government is illegitimate,'' said Rally of the Republicans spokesman Amadou Coulibaly. While the party has not officially called for protest, Coulibaly said demonstrations erupted ``spontaneously'' and he accused Gbagbo followers of attacking his party's backers Wednesday as they returned from demonstrations. Several people were injured, he said. More than 50 people were killed in clashes Tuesday and Wednesday involving civilians and the military that brought Gbagbo to power. Gbagbo, a left-leaning politician and former university professor, called for the popular uprising Tuesday after Guei disbanded the electoral commission and declared himself the winner. While Gbagbo's victory in the streets was greeted with shouts of jubilation, within a few hours the festivities took a sober turn. More than a thousand Ouattara supporters rallied in front of the state television offices just yards away from a similar group of Gbagbo supporters. Ouattara's backers called for new elections and warned of clashes if Gbagbo refused. ``There will be no president in Ivory Coast without new elections,'' said Siriman Coulibaly, a 23-year-old unemployed mechanic. Although both Guei and Gbagbo claimed they won the vote, vote-counting never got far enough to announce a real winner. The junta stopped public tabulation Monday after a fraction of the vote had been counted, showing Gbagbo with a slight edge. Gbagbo said Wednesday he would have the count finished. Gbagbo called himself president but said he would not take on all the functions of chief of state until his win was approved by the commission and the Supreme Court. Guei came to power in December during the first military takeover in Ivory Coast. He had promised the elections would mark a return to civilian rule.

North Korea accused the U.S. and South Korean militaries Thursday of hurting thawing relations by holding a joint military exercise. The two militaries on Wednesday began the 10-day Foal Eagle exercise, the biggest of several joint training maneuvers held annually. U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright had ended a visit to Pyongyang on Wednesday, citing progress in resolving issues such as the North's missile development. ``The maneuvers prove that the U.S. is still pursuing the policy of strength in its strategy towards (North Korea) and that the South Korean authorities are following with increased zeal the U.S. strategy,'' a spokesman for North Korea's Foreign Ministry said in remarks carried by the official Korean Central News Agency. ``It is as good as spoiling the good atmosphere created in favor of reconciliation and cooperation,'' said the spokesman, who was not named. South Korea and the United States have characterized past military exercises as defensive, but North Korea has denounced them as a rehearsal for a northward invasion. About 37,000 U.S. troops are stationed in South Korea. The Foal Eagle exercise, held since 1961, is to test rear area protection operations and major command, control and communications systems and involves field training for U.S. and South Korean troops, military officials said. The size of this year's exercise was not announced. In last year's maneuvers, 500,000 South Korean and 30,000 U.S. troops were mobilized for sea, land and air drills. Similar exercises earlier this year were scaled down amid thawing relations between two Koreas following a historic summit of their leaders in June.

at the bottom of the sea. two months after the submarine "kursk" went down with 118 men on board, dives have managed to get inside. they found five bodies so far. and today, they found a note, written after a pair of explosions ripped through the hull and sent the "kursk" into the depths of the bairnts see. here's abc's bob woodruff. the note was discovered by divers inside one compartment of the submarine, on the body of 27-year-old lieutenant captain dmitry kolesnikov, photographed here on board the "kursk" three years ago. "i am writing blindly," he wrote apparently in darkness. "none of us can get to the surface." russian officials believe the note was written at least two hours after the sub began to sink. "all the crew from the sixth, seventh and eighth compartments went over to the ninth." kolesnikov wrote, "there are 23 people here. we made this decision as a result of the accident." the note contains no new evidence about what sank the "kursk," whether it was an internal explosion or a collision. but it does contradict the official russian version that was given to family members, that all 118 men had died instantly. today, the chief of russia's navy was forced to admit to the families he was wrong, that some of the crew not only survived, according to kolesnikov's note, two or three tried to get out through the escape hatch. but it may have been flooded. today, kolesnikov's widow could not hold back her tears. "it's horribly painful, it's awful," she said. "i had a feeling that he didn't die immediately, and it turned out my feeling was right." she also says her husband had a premonition. last summer, before he wento sea, he gave her his dog tag and a crews fix. and said he may not be coming back. bob woodruff, abc news, london.

from russia tonight, word of a shocking discovery from the wreckage of that russian submarine. more than two months after a deadly explosion buried the "kursk" in the cold waters of the barents sea, a letter has surfaced. nbc's jim miklaszewski has the latest. today, ten weeks after a mysterious accident sent the "kursk" to the bottom of the barents sea, a grisly discovery -- norwegian and russian divers cut through the hull to find four bodies. in the pocket of one of the crew, a handwritten note, the dying words of a sailor who was trapped alive in the sunken sub. he's lieutenant-captain dmitry koleskinov, seen here three years ago aboard the kursk, but his last words tell a chilling tale of a desperate, but futile attempt to escape. in fact, it now appears at least 23 crew members survived the initial explosions that quickly filled the first five compartments with water, killing most of the 118-man crew instantly. the 23 frantically scramble to the rear of the sub. they find the escape hatch flooded and seal themselves into compartment nine. then, in total darkness and frigid cold, koleskinov realizing he will die begins to write -- koleskinov addressed the letter to his wife, olga. he's my dear, dear beloved. i want to see him again, i want to read his letter. the chilling account raises new questions and criticism of the russian navy, which waited several days before attempting to launch a rescue mission. but u.s. navy officials here at the pentagon believe any rescue mission would have failed, that there was really no hope for those 23 survivors. with no power, more than 300 feet down, it's believed any survivors would have frozen to death within hours, well before they ran out of air. that's of little consolation to the families who today hear the first and what made be the final words of the doomed crew of the "kursk. jim miklaszewski, nbc news, the pentagon.

Russian divers have found a cryptic note on the body of one of the sailors on the doomed Russian submarine Kursk, which sank in the Barents Sea. The note says at least 23 men did not die instantly. Russian naval officials have not released the contents of the note, but Russia's Etar Tass News Agency published excerpts. The agency reports that the note reads all the crew from the 6th, 7th and 8th compartments went over to the 9th because of the accident. Those compartments are toward the rear or aft of the submarine. The note continues, none of us can get to the surface and ends, I am writing blindly. The note was in the pocket of one of four victims retrieved from the Kursk and was written at least two hours after the first of two catastrophic explosions sank the submarine.

Authorities in Mexico City have begun special patrols to check on compliance with safety regulations at nightclubs, discotheques and bars. As VOA's Greg Flakus reports, the checks come in the wake of a fire last week that killed 19 people. In response to the deadly fire at the Lobo Ombo nightclub last week, Mexico City Mayor Rosarrio Roblez is initiating a special period of surprise inspections at more than 200 nightclubs in the city. She says this is not an attempt to catch business owners who are not in compliance, but an attempt to improve safety for everyone. She says the message sent by this action is one of security and it should not be viewed as a message of repression or harassment. She says the idea is that everyone should work together to improve safety conditions for young people. The city's program gives a 15 to 25 day period of tolerance to club owners to fix whatever problems inspectors encounter. A representative of Mexico's Discotheque Association Ismail Rivera also met with the mayor and other city officials and expressed support for the special patrols. He says this is a way for business owners to know what the problems are and then address them. He says the only clubs that will be closed are those that are in flagrant violation of the laws and regulations. Meantime, at a special hearing on Thursday, an investigator for the Mexico City attorney general's office Pedro Estrada presented a long list of violations that he says led to the tragedy at Lobo Ombo. He says that investigators found that the club did not have proper emergency exits, lacked fire alarms and a fire-control system, and had numerous deficiencies in its electrical system. In recent days, Mexican television cameras have entered several city clubs to show how few of them have proper emergency exits. In some cases, those that do have exits have the doors locked or barred in an effort to prevent people from entering or leaving without paying. Greg Flakus, VOA News, Mexico City.

The note was found in the pocket of Lieutenant Dimitri Kolesnikov whose body was one of the first to be recovered the explosions that shattered the submarine. Most of the Kursk's crew apparently died instantly in the explosions that tore open the Kursk's first six compartments or within minutes as water roared into the submarine. Lieutenant Kolesnikov's note indicates some crewmembers survived for several hours.

Longtime opposition leader Laurent Gbagbo was sworn in as president Thursday at the heavily guarded presidential palace, as political officials appealed for an end to the violence that has wracked Abidjan and other cities in this West African nation. ``I feel in this moment the renaissance of the Ivory Coast, the birth of a modern, prosperous, democratic and united nation,'' said Gbagbo, who was swept to power Wednesday in a popular uprising that forced junta leader Gen. Robert Guei to flee. But street celebrations over the junta's downfall Wednesday were short-lived, and by Thursday morning Gbagbo's supporters, sometimes backed by security forces, were battling followers of a rival political boss with machetes, rocks and clubs. Dozens of people were said to have been killed. At least three people were burned alive in the working class neighborhood of Yopougon, a witness said, and three mosques were torched. At least one church was burned in another part of town as residents fled the worst areas. Supporters of Ivory Coast's most popular opposition figure, Alassane Dramane Ouattara _ most of them Muslims from northern-based tribes _ fought Gbagbo's backers, who are mostly Christians from southern ethnic groups. ``People are dying,'' said Aida Diallo, who was fleeing one burning neighborhood to get to her family's home. ``I'm scared, so scared.'' Much of the violence had died down in Abidjan by early afternoon, following large-scale deployment of security forces firing tear gas into crowds and gunshots into the air. Thursday night, senior officials with Gbagbo's Ivorian Popular Front and Ouattara's Rally of the Republicans appeared together on state-controlled television to appeal for peace. ``We call on all our militants, our supporters, to desist,'' Gbagbo official Lida Kouassi said. ``Ivory Coast is in the process of coming out of anguish.'' The U.S. Embassy on Thursday ordered its nonessential staff and all embassy dependents to leave this Ivory Coast for at least 30 days, a U.S. diplomat said. Americans not part of the embassy community have not been advised to leave, the diplomat said. Earlier Wednesday, witnesses said Gbagbo supporters and security forces had tried to advance on Ouattara's compound in a wealthy Abidjan suburb, but had been pushed back by crowds who have surrounded the house for weeks. Less serious clashes continued intermittently outside the house. At one intersection in the nearby neighborhood of Blokosso, ethnic Ebrie youths chased frightened motorists while screaming and waving machetes. Residents said the youths were seeking revenge for the destruction of a Blokosso church, allegedly by Ouattara supporters. An official with Ouattara's party said at least 40 _ and perhaps as many as 80 _ of his supporters were killed Thursday. Gbagbo's party officials said there was no way to know how many of their supporters had died. About 50 people were reported to have died in clashes Tuesday and Wednesday. Those figures could not be independently confirmed. Ouattara's supporters are demanding that new presidential elections be held in Ivory Coast. Ouattara was excluded from Sunday's presidential elections. The vote was intended to restore civilian rule 10 months after a military coup, but former junta leader Guei disbanded the country's electoral commission while votes were still being counted Tuesday and declared himself the winner. Gbagbo's supporters _ who also claimed victory _ swarmed Ivory Coast's streets, later to be joined by members of the junta's own security forces. Guei is reported to have fled Wednesday to nearby Benin. His departure was greeted in the streets with jubilation. But within a few hours, Ouattara's followers were rallying, and black smoke billowed above Abidjan neighborhoods where Ouattara's backers had blocked off the streets with burning tires, gutted vehicles, pieces of furniture and roadside garbage. In the western city of Gagnoa, police clashed with pro-Ouattara demonstrators, while in Ouattara's northern stronghold of Korhogo, his supporters were burning opponents' houses. Gbagbo's supporters complained their rivals only took to the streets after Guei had been forced from power. On the ground, however, Gbagbo's followers were quick to respond with violence. On a street corner in Abidjan's posh Cocody suburb, young men with white stripes painted on their faces _ some carrying nail-studded sticks or machetes _ gathered on one street corner, calling themselves ``real Ivorians'' and threatening to kill Ouattara. After being sworn in, Gbagbo said he had invited Rally of the Republicans officials to meet with him later Thursday night to find a solution to their differences. He added, though: ``We will not do another presidential election.'' The Sunday election was problematic from the start. Ivory Coast's two largest parties _ Ouattara's and the former ruling Democratic Party _ boycotted the vote after their candidates were barred from running by the Supreme Court. Both accused Gbagbo of going along with an electoral farce by refusing to join the boycott. ``The great majority of the people of Ivory Coast were excluded from these elections, and this government is illegitimate,'' said Rally of the Republicans spokesman Amadou Coulibaly. U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan backed calls for new presidential elections Thursday, saying the conditions were right to put in place a democratic process to let the country's people freely elect a leader. In Washington, U.S. State Department spokesman Philip Reeker said the electoral process had been ``fundamentally flawed'' because it barred the opposition, and ``free and fair elections will be needed to get back to democracy.'' On Wednesday, the National Electoral Commission released results showing Gbagbo won the vote with 59.6 percent support, versus 32.7 percent for Guei. Minor candidates shared the rest of the vote. Guei came to power in a December coup, the first military takeover in Ivory Coast. Instability since has battered the economy and frightened Ivorians and foreign investors alike.

The new president met with his top political rival Friday in hopes of stemming violence between their followers that has torn apart this West African nation. With calm starting to return to the commercial capital, many Ivorians ventured out of their homes for the first time in days to sweep away the debris of three days of clashes and resume their lives. Downtown Abidjan was quieter than usual, but businesses started to open and people and cars returned to the streets. The talks came after brutal clashes between backers of the new president, Laurent Gbagbo, and those of a rival political leader demanding a new vote. Dozens of people were believed killed in the fighting Thursday that resulted in mosques and churches burning. The violence marred Gbagbo's inauguration at the marble-halled presidential palace on Thursday, a day after he was swept into power in a popular uprising that forced junta leader Gen. Robert Guei to flee. ``I feel in this moment the renaissance of the Ivory Coast, the birth of a modern, prosperous, democratic and united nation,'' Gbagbo said after being sworn in. Afterward, Gbagbo rejected a new ballot, as demanded by rival Alassane Dramane Ouattara, Ivory Coast's most popular opposition figure. ``We will not do another presidential election,'' Gbagbo said. But consultations began that same night between Gbagbo's Ivorian Popular Front and Ouattara's Rally of the Republicans, as well as the former ruling Democratic Front of Ivory Coast, Gbagbo's officials said. Gbagbo and Ouattara met Friday morning at the new president's residence, where they discussed the appointment of a new Cabinet, the role of the army in street protests and the establishment of new state institutions. The two leaders then shook hands and sat side by side on a sofa smiling for the cameras. Ouattara said he had told Gbagbo to form his Cabinet without the Rally, but did not rule out participating at a later stage. ``Entering the government is not a priority,'' he said. ``The priority is burying and mourning the dead.'' He said his party would focus on upcoming legislative elections. Gbagbo was expected to announce his Cabinet later Friday. The demands for a new vote come after a flawed presidential election Sunday in which Guei and Gbagbo were the main candidates. When Guei tried to claim victory in the vote, he was ousted. Ouattara, thought to have more support than Gbagbo, was barred from the vote by the Supreme Court, as were many other candidates, including those of the Democratic Party. U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan backed the calls for new presidential elections Thursday, saying the conditions were now right to put in place a democratic process to let the country's people freely elect a leader. In Washington, U.S. State Department spokesman Philip Reeker said the electoral process had been ``fundamentally flawed'' because it barred the opposition, and ``free and fair elections will be needed to get back to democracy.'' France, however, the country's former colonial ruler, said it was up to Ivorians to decide whether to hold new elections. French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin said Friday he hoped Ivorians would decide on ``a true democratic process ... starting with the elected authority that exists today.'' Thursday morning, Gbagbo's supporters, sometimes backed by security forces, battled Ouattara followers with machetes, rocks and clubs in Abidjan and other cities. At least three people were burned alive in the working class neighborhood of Yopougon, a witness said, and three mosques were torched. At least one church was burned in another part of town as residents fled the worst areas. Ouattara's backers are mostly Muslims from northern-based tribes, while Gbagbo's followers are mostly Christians from southern ethnic groups. An official with Ouattara's party said at least 40 _ and perhaps as many as 80 _ of his supporters were killed Thursday. Gbagbo's party officials said there was no way to know how many of their supporters had died. Much of the violence had died down in Abidjan by early afternoon, following large-scale deployment of security forces firing tear gas into crowds and gunshots into the air. The U.S. Embassy on Thursday ordered its nonessential staff and all embassy dependents to leave Ivory Coast for at least 30 days, a U.S. diplomat said. Americans not part of the embassy community have not been advised to leave, the diplomat said. The new clashes continued the violence that has wracked a nation that had been seen as West Africa's most stable _ though earlier this week the clashes had focused on ousting Guei, who came to power 10 months ago in a military coup. About 50 people were reported to have died in clashes Tuesday and Wednesday. Those figures could not be independently confirmed. In the unrest, Gbagbo's supporters had swarmed the streets after Guei disbanded the election commission and declared victory in Sunday's vote. Soldiers, who at first fired on demonstrators, then backed the uprising, and Guei reportedly fled to nearby Benin. While slowly returning to normal, Abidjan remained uneasy Friday. Officials went on state-run radio to quell rumors that the city's water supply had been poisoned.

Stormy seas prevented divers from entering the nuclear submarine Kursk on Friday, a day after naval officials revealed evidence that more than 20 seamen had survived the initial explosions that sank the vessel. Meanwhile, anger against the government for its slow and confused response to the Aug. 12 disaster was revived after officials found an emotional letter in the pocket of a dead crewman describing the survivors' moments after the catastrophe. ``The Kursk crew has been buried alive,'' Veronika Marchenko, head of the anti-military association Mother's Right, said in a statement issued Friday. ``The government was trying to solve all possible problems, such as concealing the tragedy, protecting military secrets, raising the plummeting popularity of the president, paying off too-persistent relatives or hushing up honest journalists. All except one: acting quickly to save the crew.'' ``We should think what to do to make the government value citizens' lives more than oil, military secrets or its own prestige.'' Winds of up to 56 mph and a force-six gale in the Barents Sea kept divers away from the wreck Friday due to the danger of being jerked about on their tethers, said Northern Fleet spokesman Capt. Vladimir Navrotsky. ``The weather is worsening, with a snowstorm raging around the rescue site,'' he said. On Wednesday, divers recovered four bodies from the Kursk's eighth and ninth compartments. Officials found a note in the pocket of a submariner identified as Lt. Dmitry Kolesnikov, which gave the first firm indication that some of the sailors had remained alive for at least several hours after the explosions that sank the submarine. Fragments from Kolesnikov's message told a horrifying story of the submariners' struggle for life, saying 23 survivors had gathered in a compartment in the stern, hoping to get out through the escape hatch. Most of the Kursk's crew of 118 apparently died instantly in the explosions that sent a giant fireball and shock wave ripping through the first five compartments, or perished within minutes as water roared into the submarine. But the revelation that some died a slow and torturous death _ by drowning, hypothermia or suffocation _ has brought back the horror that gripped the nation in the days after the disaster. And once again, it called into question whether the government could have saved some of the crew if it had not balked for days at accepting foreign aid. After the Kursk sank, Russian submersibles were unable to latch onto the hatch, and the cash-strapped navy didn't have deep-sea divers who could enter the submarine. When Norwegian divers were finally invited to perform the work, four days after the sinking, they did it within hours. The newspaper Segodnya said Kolesnikov's note was ``deadly for the government.'' ``The authorities buried the Kursk too early, maybe even when it was still alive,'' it said. Kolesnikov's note gave no indication of whether any of the crew had survived beyond a few hours. Deputy Prime Minister Ilya Klebanov quickly ruled out Thursday that there was any chance to save any of the crew. Northern Fleet commander Adm. Vyacheslav Popov said Friday he believed no seamen could have survived longer than one day. ``The time of death can be established only by forensic expertise,'' he said. ``As a submariner, I can only assume that the crew died no later than Aug. 13, and most likely before midnight of Aug. 12.'' The statement has puzzled some experts and drew suspicions that the navy officials were withholding some information. ``They could have died within 24 hours or they could have lasted longer than that,'' said Clifford Beal, editor of Jane's Defense Weekly in London. ``Unless Adm. Popov has more information than he is giving out, I don't see how he could say that at this point.'' ``The level of disinformation on the part of the Northern Fleet during the rescue operation makes me doubtful that we can trust even the information they are giving out now,'' Beal said. Popov said he had little hope the divers would be able to recover all the bodies from the ninth compartment, which is littered with equipment dislodged from stowage places by the explosions. He said it took divers more than two hours to recover one body that had been squeezed between two metal cases. ``It's very difficult for the divers to move inside the ninth compartment,'' he said. Nevertheless, he said the divers would try to remove as many bodies as they could when the weather permits. The Navy has previously said it would cancel the operation if it is too risky for the divers. Officials initially planned to hold a memorial ceremony Saturday in Severomorsk, the headquarters of the Northern Fleet, but postponed it because of the gale that prevented helicopters from bringing the four bodies to the shore.

After an unexplained two-week delay, North Korea put its contacts with South Korea back on track Friday, proposing new schedules for family reunions and economic talks, Seoul officials said. The second round of reunions for families separated for five decades will be held Nov. 30-Dec. 2, officials said. ``I wish my mother were still alive to hear this great news,'' said Lee Sung-hwan, 64, who learned Friday that the brother he last saw half a century ago is alive in the North and anxious to meet him. The two Koreas held a successful reunion of 200 separated families _ 100 from each side _ in August, then agreed to stage two more reunions for the same number of people on Nov. 2-4 and Dec. 5-7. But North Korea let the Oct. 13 deadline for the November reunions pass without explanation, prompting South Korea to file an official complaint a week later. The North's delay may have been due to preparations for celebrations of the 55th anniversary of the founding of the North's ruling Worker's Party on Oct. 10 and this week's historic visit by Secretary of State Madeleine Albright. Early Thursday, North Korea sent a message proposing a resumption of family reunions and other projects agreed on earlier by the two sides, South Korea's Unification Ministry officials said. In two separate proposals Friday, North Korea suggested that the Nov. 2-4 family reunion be rescheduled for Nov. 30-Dec. 2 and the Oct. 18-21 economic talks for Nov. 8-11, South Korean Red Cross and government officials said. South Korea agreed. Reuniting the tens of thousands of Koreans separated by the Korean War is an emotional issue in South Korea. About 90,000 South Koreans have applied to travel to the North Korea to meet relatives they last saw five decades ago. Relations between the two Koreas have improved significantly since their leaders met for the first time ever in June and agreed to work toward reconciliation and unification. The two sides since have halted propaganda broadcasts, opened border liaison offices, exchanged high-level envoys and started work on reconnecting a cross-border railway.

The Senate race between the late Gov. Mel Carnahan and Republican Sen. John Ashcroft remains extremely close little more than a week after Carnahan's death in a plane crash. A telephone poll conducted for The Kansas City Star found the Democrat Carnahan and incumbent Ashcroft at 46 percent each. Seven percent were undecided and 1 percent preferred third-party candidates. The poll had a margin of error of 4 percentage points. Because Carnahan died so close to the Nov. 7 election, his name will remain on the ballot. Democratic Gov. Roger Wilson has said he would appoint Carnahan's widow, Jean, if Carnahan wins. Jean Carnahan has not said whether she will accept. Experts cautioned the race could change quickly. ``I can't predict what will happen once a little more time and distance is put between last week's events,'' said Brad Coker, managing director of Mason-Dixon Polling &AMP; Research, which conducted the survey. In a second question, the poll conducted on Monday and Tuesday included an explanation of Carnahan's death and Wilson's plan to appoint Carnahan's widow for a two-year term if Carnahan were the top vote-getter. With the additional information, Carnahan's support rose to 47 percent with Ashcroft at 45 percent, the first time Carnahan was ahead in an independent survey since February. New polls in Virginia and Michigan also found Senate races in statistical dead heats. In Virginia, Democratic Sen. Chuck Robb has cut into the lead held by Republican George Allen. A poll released Thursday found Allen's small lead within the margin of error. Forty-seven percent of the voters said they would vote for Allen if the election were held then, while 44 percent backed Robb. Nine percent were undecided. The poll of 627 likely voters on Tuesday and Wednesday was conducted for newspapers and broadcasters by Mason-Dixon Polling &AMP; Research. It has a margin of error of four percentage points. For the past two years, Allen has enjoyed a comfortable lead in the polls. But in the past three months, Robb has cut the margin with gains among female voters. In July, women voters were evenly split. Now, Robb has an 11-percentage point lead. At the same time, Allen has maintained roughly a 20-percentage point lead among men. Robb is no stranger to comebacks. Six years ago, he also trailed his Republican opponent throughout most of the campaign, taking a small lead in the polls only a few days before winning the three-way race. In Michigan, a poll released Thursday found Democratic Rep. Debbie Stabenow in a dead heat with Republican incumbent Spence Abraham after months of trailing Abraham. The poll, by Lansing's EPIC/MRA, shows Abraham and Stabenow each with 41 percent, with 15 percent of voters undecided. The poll, conducted for the Detroit Free Press and WXYZ-TV of Detroit, questioned 600 likely voters Monday through Wednesday and had a margin of error of plus or minus four percentage points. Only two weeks ago, Stabenow was 10 points behind.

A measure of order returned to the streets of cities here Friday after leaders of the two main political factions met, easing the violent clashes that had erupted between their followers after the country's military dictator was driven from power. The leaders of the two main parties had been unified in their opposition to the dictator, Gen. Robert Guei, who was overthrown in a public uprising on Wednesday after he claimed to be the winner of elections held Sunday. But the party leaders were quickly pulled apart by religion, ethnic divisions and their leaders' ambitions. The two sides began fighting on Thursday and violent clashes between police and rival factions occurred here and in smaller cities. Alassane D. Ouattara, the most popular opposition leader and a Muslim, had been banned from participating in the elections by Guei, who seized power in a coup on Dec. 24 of last year. Outtara's followers responded by boycotting the vote. Guei was defeated by the only opposition candidate allowed to run, Laurent Gbagbo, the leader of the Socialist Party and a Christian, who quickly asserted his claim to the presidency after Guei was ousted. Gbagbo, sworn in as president on Thursday, swiftly rejected a demand by Ouattara, a former prime minister, for new elections. But Ouattara appeared to set aside his demand for a new election after the two men met Friday morning at Gbagbo's presidential residence. After the private meeting, they shook hands publicly and sat side by side. Originally, Gbagbo said he wanted to form a national unity government. But Ouattara said after the meeting Friday morning that he would not join Gbagbo's government, at least for now. Ouattara said his party, Rally of the Republicans, would concentrate on legislative elections, which are scheduled for December. ``Entering the government is not a priority,'' Ouattara said. ``The priority is burying and mourning the dead.'' Dozens of people were reported killed in Abidjan on Thursday, pushing the toll over three days to near 90. But on Friday shops began to reopen, families emerged from hiding and people began to sweep up the detritus and rubble that remained from the days of clashes and confrontations between soldiers and citizens, Muslims and Christians. The United Nations, the United States and the Organization for African Unity had all called for a new presidential election. But France, the former colonial power and the biggest foreign power broker here, said it was satisfied with the results of Sunday's election. Gbagbo has close ties with the Socialist Party in France. On Wednesday, euphoria had swept the country after tens of thousands of Ivoirians descended on the city center and, in scenes that recalled the popular revolt against Slobodan Milosevic in Yugoslavia, but were unusual in Africa, overthrew Guei. The general fled Abidjan, and his current whereabouts are unknown. The rival parties in the Ivory Coast, which generally represent different ethnic and religious groups, clashed after Guei lost the support of the army and Gbagbo declared himself president. The security forces, which had supported Guei, began backing Gbagbo. And Ouattara was forced to flee to the German ambassador's residence Thursday morning after security forces surrounded his house and fired tear gas and ammunition. Thursday, supporters of Ouattara and Gbagbo fought one another with machetes and clubs. By Thursday night the violence appeared to have died down after two high-ranking officials from Ouattara's and Gbagbo's parties appeared together on state television and urged their followers to stop fighting.

good evening, the united states is bringing most of its investigators home from yemen. things have not gone quite as the u.s. had hoped. nearly 200 american agents went to yemen right after the attack on the "cole." a very high profile investigation in a very tense part of the world. the yemenis are worried about the threat to their national sovereignty. we got our closest look at the damage to the "cole" today, but even as we did, and even as the secretary of state thanked the yemenis for their early corporation, investigators in the field think they have hit a brick wall. abc's john miller reports tonight from the port city of aden. the fbi agents moved out in a caravan of trucks and buses, with all their gear in tow. they are leaving frustrated. the majority are going home, some will stay on the tarawa, a navy ship offshore. sources tell abc news the agents are moving out because of security concerns, but mostly because the yemeni government is not allowing the fbi to do what it came here to do. while there has been a great deal of talk about the high level of cooperation between the yemeni investigators and their american counterparts, in this investigation, there is a growing level of frustration on the part of u.s. officials, because even now, two weeks into the case, no u.s. agent has been given independent access to interview any of the witnesses or suspects. the f was allowed to visit suspected safe houses and collect evidence and fingerprints, but only after yemeni investigators had been through the houses first. yesterday, the american ambassador and a senior fbi official met with president ally saleh to complain that yemeni investigators were not sharing leads or information. some u.s. officials believe the yemeni are concerned about sharing information that could be embarrassing to a country that has been called a haven for terrorists. but u.s. officials say without access to the witnesses here, the future of any american prosecution for the murder of 17 sailors is in doubt. john miller, abc news, aden.

As a new president prepares to take power in Mexico, the biggest economic news is what's not happening. The peso is not plummeting, investors are not panicking, and people are not suddenly paying more for their tortillas or televisions. Given recent history, this is a small miracle: every presidential transition in the last two decades has been scarred by an economic crisis. Instead of fears, there are great hopes, all raised by the next president, Vicente Fox. ``The revolution of the 21st century has begun,'' Fox, who takes office on Dec. 1, proclaimed last week. His advisers have compared his election on July 2, which ended seven decades of political domination by a single party, to the fall of the Berlin Wall. Ever since, during the long transition, he has been promising to tear down the corrupt and inefficient legacies of the past, and to erect modern and rational practices in their place. That has not been easy in Germany _ and may be harder in Mexico. Fox now must institutionalize the stability he has inherited. He has pledged sweeping tax and fiscal reforms, annual economic growth rates of up to 7 percent, millions of new jobs, a stable economic architecture for foreign capital, private investment in the state-run oil industry and competition in telecommunications. He also promises budget austerity, increased social spending, the rise of the rule of law and an end to ingrained political corruption. To do all this might take 60 years, rather than the six-year term that Fox has won. It will require constitutional changes, the cooperation of a divided Congress, and lots of luck. But many of Mexico's most prominent and powerful business figures are cheering for him. ``What I have heard is very encouraging,'' said Alejandro Elizondo Barragan, president and chief executive of Hylsamex, one of the country's largest steel manufacturers. ``This country needs to grow, and Fox is very aware of that.'' Fox, a former Coca-Cola executive who entered politics as a congressman and later became a governor, knows that he was elected to change the way Mexico works. If he made good on half of his promises, Mexico would be transformed. ``The most fundamental challenge for Fox will be dealing with the enormously profound expectations Mexicans have of him after winning the election,'' said Luis Rubio, the director of Cidac, an economic and political research organization in Mexico City. ``Now he will have to deliver.'' Millions of Mexicans, and many foreign investors, are hoping that he will. Mexico is still very much a developing nation. Reliable electric power and potable water are sometimes hard to find. In the capital, one of the world's most populous and polluted cities, the elite live behind barricades, protected from the impoverished by armed guards. Middle-class Mexicans have less buying power than they did 20 years ago, and some of the biggest banks are shaky from a legacy of bad loans. Many small businesses are threatened by imports, credit is difficult to obtain, and millions of people scrape by on less than $2 a day. The departing president, Ernesto Zedillo, never addressed the huge structural problems of the state-run energy industries, which are inefficient and suppress competition, or of the justice system, which cannot control crime _ a serious worry for foreign companies considering operations here here even if they are optimistic about Fox. ``He's going to have his hands full,'' said Peter E. Weber, vice president of Latin American operations for FMC Corp., a Chicago-based industrial and chemical company that does extensive business in Mexico. ``Fox will have to address the crime situation, which has an impact on attracting foreign investment. There's an awful lot of work to be done in the microeconomy, the ability of industry and agriculture to compete on a global scale, improving the quality of education.'' Yet Zedillo has enabled Fox to come to power in a Mexico that looks _ on paper _ economically stronger than ever. Real growth rates have averaged 5 percent for the last four years. Driven by the North American Free Trade Agreement, Mexican exports to the United States have grown from about $60 billion in 1995 to more than $100 billion in 1999. Richard W. Fisher, the deputy U.S. trade representative, estimated that two-way trade between Mexico and the United States is running at the equivalent of more than half a million dollars a minute. At its current growth rate, it will exceed the trade between the United States and the European Union by 2004. In June alone, Fisher said, ``we sold them $700 million worth of semiconductors, 28,000 cars and trucks, $48 million worth of surgical equipment, 250,000 tons of soybeans and 200,000 golf balls.'' Mexico's leading exports include machinery, oil, clothes, fresh vegetables, glass and electronics parts. Moody's Investors' Service raised Mexico's foreign debt rating to investment grade in March. That same month, Mexico signed a free-trade agreement with the European Union. Foreign investment is expected to exceed $12 billion this year after averaging about $11 billion since 1995. Inflation is decreasing _ and is predicted to fall below 10 percent this year. Wall Street appears to love Mexico's central bankers, especially Guillermo Ortiz, the central bank president, whose term lasts three more years. All of these are indicators of Zedillo's achievements. They give international investors reasons to believe, given continuing fiscal austerity and a stable currency, that the nation may become stronger without severe growing pains. If it does, the credit will go in roughly equal measures to the two men trading places at Los Pinos, the presidential mansion. Zedillo, an economist trained in the United States, took office in 1994, inheriting and in some cases aggravating a series of financial shocks that staggered Mexico, including a banking crisis that may wind up costing citizens $100 billion. But he is in many ways keeping his pledge two years ago ``to hand over the presidency in healthy economic conditions, protected from the crises that have ruined the country over the past 20 years.'' Some of the success has to do with the trade and economic policies that Zedillo instituted during his first three years in office. Some has to do with what he was handed: namely, NAFTA. Mexican government figures show that export growth generated by the free trade agreement accounted for nearly half of the 3.3 million jobs created in Mexico in the last five years. But nothing that Zedillo has done for Mexico economically may be more important than the way that he is giving up power. He became the first president of Mexico to create the conditions for truly free elections and a democratic transition of power. For decades, the economy, like every other institution in Mexico, was manipulated by the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party. Every six years, every president played tricks to help his hand-picked successor win _ artificially strengthening the peso, increasing the money supply, lowering interest rates, handing out a nationwide wage increase shortly before election day. The party kept power, but the economy kept crashing, undermined by the previous administration's acts of self-interest. Zedillo, mindful of that history, strove to make the economy more institutional than individual. He never took on some sacred cows _ like state-run oil and state-sanctioned barriers to competition _ and thus never fully transformed Mexico's centralized economy into that of a modern market-driven nation. But when he gave independence to Ortiz and the central bank in 1997, Ortiz turned the central bank into a stabilizing power. ``The central bank's independence, as an institutional counterbalance to the presidency, was also a deliberate erosion of the power of the presidency,'' said Gray Newman, the head of the Latin American economics group at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter in New York. The price of a stable economy was the loss of power. On election day four months ago, the country was stable enough to change without an economic or political crisis. And if Fox has his way, it will keep changing, drastically. ``Mexico's old six-year curse appears to be broken,'' Newman said. ``But there is now a curse of abundance. Rapidly growing economy, flush with cash _ sounds like you couldn't ask for more. That is why it is so risky for Fox right now.'' The risk is that Fox, having promised change, will fail _ foiled by the Congress, where the old ruling party still holds a plurality, and by the high expectations he has raised. Fox, 58, cuts a rougher figure than his courtly predecessor. A Reaganesque rancher, wearing cowboy boots engraved with his name, he has little formal background in economics. By instinct and training from his days as president of Coca-Cola of Mexico, he sold himself to Mexico like a soft drink. He is a delegator, with deep faith in corporate management techniques. He is a man given to great, sometimes transitory enthusiasm, and his transition to power has been marked by a few possibly pie-in-the-sky fiscal policy pronouncements. He has promised that the economy will grow by up to 7 percent a year-_ although he is now hedging on that bet. (GDP grew at an annual rate of 7.6 percent in the second quarter, fueled in part by windfall revenue from Mexican oil exports, but Merrill Lynch's and J.P. Morgan's economists are predicting Mexico's growth rate will slow to 4 percent in 2001.) He has also pledged to create 1.35 million jobs a year, spend millions to fight illiteracy, poverty and disease, and to institute the first coherent tax-collection system that Mexico has ever known. But during the long transition, Fox _ who has yet to name a cabinet _ has also failed to say precisely how he will accomplish all this. Fox has some other lofty ideas. One is his vision of the United States, Mexico and Canada united in a common market, their borders mere lines on the map, a generation from now. Another is breaking down corrupt structures in banking, finance, real estate and political circles. He expresses high regard for the Grameen bank, the Bangladeshi institution that pioneered credits for the poor, and he promises to help Mexico's farmers and shopkeepers with loans. As the governor of the state of Guanajuato in 1995, Fox himself started such a bank, granting credits of $50 and up. He wants to enforce tax collection from the rich, something that Mexico does poorly. Tax revenue is equal to only 11 percent of Mexico's GDP, compared with 30 percent in the United States. The low level of tax collection means that the government can do far less to help the 30 million or more Mexicans living below the poverty level. Fox also says he will seek to tax many of the poor _ millions of people who are off the grid of the formal economy, like street vendors. He aims to increase value-added tax collections on retail sales by 17 percent next year. That includes a deeply unpopular proposal to impose the tax on food and medicine _ the single largest component of new revenue that Fox proposes, and the most politically sensitive. He would ease the pain for millions of families making less than $12 a day by providing direct subsidies. One key to Fox's success will be whether he can open Mexico's electrical and petrochemical sectors to foreign investment and change the nature of Petroleos de Mexico, known as Pemex, the state-run oil and natural gas company, to allow more competition. Such a shift would diminish Mexico's financial reliance on Pemex, which provides about a third of the government's annual revenue. Some members of Fox's circle _ including people vying to become cabinet ministers _ have suggested that Pemex have more autonomy and that the entire energy sector, including the ragged electric-power grid, be opened to private investment. Mexico is the last large nation in the Western hemisphere without private-sector power. The departing administration's top energy officials say Mexico would have to amend its constitution to allow private investment in electricity. And restructuring Pemex would be a radical change for Mexico, which nationalized the oil industry in the 1930s. But if Fox wants to meet his economic goals, he may have to change the way energy is made and sold in Mexico. Demand is outpacing the supplies provided by state-run monopolies. To meet demand, $5 billion a year in new investments in electricity and $2 billion a year in natural gas may be needed for the next decade. ``Everything starts with the need for economic growth, and to get it you need to make the energy sector more productive, and to do that you have to open it up to foreign investment,'' said Daniel Yergin, chairman of Cambridge Energy Research Associates, a petroleum consulting firm in Cambridge, Mass. ``You've got to get the gas and power from somewhere.'' Fox has said he will push Congress in the coming year to open up the electricity and natural-gas markets. Not everyone is confident that it can be accomplished so soon. ``We are very eager for the new administration, to see the new rules of the game,'' said Jean Noel Mesnard of Gaz de France in Mexico. ``Providing natural gas for Mexico is going to be a big question in the coming years, and opening it up to private operators would be a good solution.'' The lack of affordable energy already is threatening some businesses, like iron and steel manufacturers who laid off hundreds of workers in September after natural-gas prices shot up. ``The root of the problem is that we have a monopoly here,'' said Elizondo, the Hylsamex chief executive, who is also chairman of Mexico's iron and steel industry council. ``There's only one supplier of natural gas, and that's Pemex. The most important thing is to do away with the monopoly, open up the industry to private investment, local and foreign, and allow market forces to freely do their work.'' Fisher, the deputy U.S. trade representative, said he is convinced that Fox ``believes that competition is good and monopolies are bad.'' ``He understands, as a business guy, that to take Mexico to the next stage of growth, he's going to have to put in place structures that enhance competition and encourage foreign investment,'' Fisher said. Making rich and powerful Mexicans pay their taxes and obey the law would also help. Mexico did not invent impunity, but after 70 years of often corrupt one-party rule, it has made an art of it. A contract signed with a powerful person in Mexico may not be a legally enforceable document, one member of Mexico's business elite observed. Changing that culture is another of Fox's pledges, and it may also be hard to fulfill. ``But if they're going to take the final steps to institute the rule of law and provide investors with an encouraging, not an uncomfortable, environment, it will have to be done,'' Fisher said. Rogelio Ramirez de la O., one of Mexico's best-respected economic analysts, says Fox has to change the way Mexico runs, down to the roots, if he is to succeed in the economic realm. ``With the banking and energy sectors, he has to be able to change the way they operate,'' he said. ``That implies reducing the size of state companies like Pemex and making them more efficient. That implies changing the government, not just the company. It implies fiscal reform, judicial reform, regulation and competition.'' That is what the middle-class, educated people who helped put Fox in power voted for. In the election, the freest and fairest in Mexico's history, one of Fox's strongest assets was who he was not: not a member of the political ruling class, not weighed down by its often sordid past. He is already a historic figure: the man who drove the world's longest-ruling party from power after seven decades. Amid great change, the country feels stable, and its economy looks strong for the moment. But Mexico is a land of earthquakes, and if Fox cannot keep his promises when he is in power, the ground may well shake before he leaves office in 2006.

The damaged USS Cole will be loaded onto a Norwegian ``heavy lift'' ship under contract to the U.S. Navy in the Gulf of Aden on Monday for transport to the United States, officials said Friday. The Blue Marlin, which normally is used to lift and transport commercial cargo such as oil rigs, is expected to arrive in the Gulf of Aden, off the coast of Yemen, on Sunday from the Persian Gulf port of Dubai, where it was outfitted for the job, said Marge Holtz, spokeswoman for the Navy's Military Sealift Command. The Navy signed the $4.5 million contract with the Blue Marlin's owner, Offshore Heavy Transport of Oslo, Norway, just a few days after the Cole was attacked while refueling in Aden, Yemen, on Oct. 12. The schedule calls for the Blue Marlin to take the crippled Cole onto its deck on Monday in a process that will take at least 24 hours, Holtz said. The timing is uncertain because the condition of the Cole will be better understood once it is lifted out of the water. It has been in the port of Aden since the attack by terrorists in a small boat who maneuvered alongside the 505-foot destroyer and detonated explosives. The Cole has a hole in the left side of its hull estimated at 40 feet wide and 40 feet high. The explosion killed 17 sailors, wounded 39 and tore much of the midsection of the ship to shreds of metal and wire. Most of the crew of about 300 has remained aboard the 8,300-ton ship since the attack. A small number are to stay aboard for the trip back to the United States; the rest will be flown home. The Navy has said it intends to repair the Cole and return it to service, although it has not yet decided where the work will be done, spokesman Cmdr. Greg Smith said. Although the Navy initially said it planned to take the Cole back to its home port of Norfolk Naval Station in Virginia, Smith said Friday that it might instead take it to Ingalls Shipbuilding in Pascagoula, Miss., where it was built, or to the Bath Iron Works shipyard in Bath, Maine, which built other Arleigh Burke-class destroyers like the Cole. The Navy has told Congress it may take $150 million to repair the Cole, which cost $1 billion to build. Navy officials have said the harbor waters of Aden are too shallow for the Blue Marlin to do the lift operation, so the Cole will have to be towed out into the Gulf of Aden. To lift the Cole, the Blue Marlin will fill her ballast tanks, slowly submerging her deck and maneuvering under the Cole. Then the Blue Marlin will empty her ballast tanks, rising back to her normal draft of 35 feet and lifting the Cole out of the water. The trip back to the United States is expected to take about five weeks, Holtz said. The Cole's Tomahawk and Harpoon missiles and other munitions, which were not damaged in the bombing, will remain aboard in their normal storage area, officials said. ___ On the Net: The USS Cole: http://www.spear.navy.mil/ships/ddg67 Navy's latest news on Cole: http://www.chinfo.navy.mil/navpalib/news/news_stories/cole.html The Blue Marlin: http://www.oht.no/fleet/index.html

It is called a houri, Arabic for a small workaday boat with an outboard motor that can be purchased for as little as $2,000 in almost any Yemeni port. But after what occurred here this month, the houri may never look the same again, at least to those who grieve for the 17 American sailors killed in the suicide bombing attack on the destroyer Cole. The houri is a low broad-beamed fishing boat, 15 to 25 feet long, made of white fiberglass, with wood seats and an outboard motor. Some have high prows, and others broad flat ones. According to Yemeni investigators, a houri, or a craft much like it, was used in the Cole attack. The investigators cite shards of fiberglass and wood found on the Cole and accounts by sailors on watch on the destroyer at the time of the attack. Houris are everywhere on the 1,500-mile coastline of Yemen. They are so numerous in the main fishing port at Sirah Island, across the Aden Peninsula from where the Cole has lain listing since the blast, that visitors can arrange to buy one in five minutes, with no questions about the buyer's identity or purpose. Along the shore, fishermen mix chagrin and inhibition as they discuss the attack. But there was also something else widely found since the bombing _ a halting, half-expressed sense of astonishment, sometimes of satisfaction and even pleasure, that a mighty power, the United States, should have had its Navy humbled by two Arab men in a motorized skiff like a houri. In Washington, the question is how the United States, with its formidable power and worldwide responsibilities, can increase its chances of foiling attacks like the one on the Cole. But a visit to Sirah and what it suggested about the ease with which the Cole bombers might have been able to take one of the first steps in their plan _buying the boat _ underscored just how difficult finding answers would be. ``You have big boats, and look, they are nothing!'' a 17-year-old who gave his name as Mohsen said as he looked out at the Cole's hull. Remarks like that one, from old and young, from men calloused from lifetimes spent stevedoring to unemployed youngsters playing at open-air pool tables, reflect a perception of something frequently debated in war colleges in the United States. A cause of sneaking pride in the developing world as much as it is a source of anguish in the West, it is called ``asymmetrical warfare,'' or simply the potential of small ideologically impassioned groups to surprise and overwhelm an enemy with far greater technology and firepower. It is an ancient concept, tracing its origins as far back as the Old Testament account of David's killing Goliath. Long before the Cole, the principle had forced its way back into the forefront of concern among American security and intelligence specialists after a series of terrorist attacks. Sirah, overlooked by an ancient Arab fort, teems with lithe quick-eyed fishermen with boot-brush mustaches who go to sea in cotton skirts called futas, the villager's everyday dress. At dawn and dusk, they shuttle from their boats to a market, clutching the day's catch of tuna and snapper, as well as rarer species found in the tropical waters between Aden and the Horn of Africa. After haggling with fish traders, the boatmen settle down, cross-legged, for sugary tea and gossip at Al Sayaad, a fishermen's cafe. For a visitor at Sirah, a tentative deal to buy a 25-foot houri along with a 75-horsepower outboard was completed in the time needed to drink just a cup of the tea. After hasty negotiations, the price was set at 925,000 rials, or $5,150. The seller, Mohammed Awad, seemed unconcerned about the buyer's identity or purpose. ``It'll be no problem,'' he said. ``You want the boat, you have it. You can be fishing in an hour.'' Not everything in the Cole attack can have been so simple. American officials here have said the attackers were well financed, with patience to prepare the bombing over weeks or months and enough help to rent or buy at least five safe houses, a four-wheel-drive vehicle and a boat trailer and mobile telephones. Building the bomb was not child's play. American officials have said it was a highly sophisticated ``shaped charge,'' housed in a heavy steel that directed the blast with sufficient power to penetrate the Cole's half-inch reinforced steel hull, designed to withstand a force of 50,000 pounds a square inch, according to the Navy. President Ali Abdullah Saleh of Yemen has said ``specialized American agencies'' had told him that the explosive, described by Yemeni officials as C4, was legally available only in the United States and Israel, as well as in one Arab country and one ``Islamic country,'' neither of which Saleh named. When it came to installing the bomb in the boat, a carpenter and a welder from Aden are among at least 60 people reportedly suspected in the investigation. The welder, working at a safe house, is widely believed to have helped fashion the covering needed to direct the explosive power. The carpenter is said to have confessed to building wood housing, possibly a false floor, to conceal the bomb. If the boat was a houri, that would not have posed major problems. Houris, though small, have a relatively deep draft, capable of carrying more than a ton and a half of fish, tackle and spare fuel beneath the slatted seats, according to the boat chandler on Sirah. Initial accounts by American officials put the quantity of explosives used against the Cole at the equivalent of 400 to 700 pounds of TNT. Subsequent accounts have suggested that the bomb might have been far larger. Saleh's contention has been that the entire enterprise had to have been carried out by terrorists with bases outside Yemen, men whom he described as ``Arab Afghans,'' meaning veterans of the Muslim guerrilla struggle in the 1980s that drove Soviet forces from Afghanistan. As the Federal Bureau of Investigation completed its examination Friday of the Cole and shore sites possibly used by the bombers and began sending home some agents, American officials here and in Washington continued to say a likely suspect was Osama bin Laden, son of a billionaire Saudi Arabian construction magnate who has inspired and directed a worldwide ``holy war'' against the United States. But the officials remained cautious, saying proof had yet to be found. ``We're not confirming such a link exists,'' an FBI spokesman, Jim Margolin, said in Washington. In the light of some of Saleh's statements, experts speculated that the FBI might be closer to identifying the culprits than it has announced. For the fishermen of Sirah, the thought of what happened to the sailors on the Cole and the billion-dollar ship packed with 21st-century technology, has a sobering resonance. ``Most of our talk here is fish talk,'' said Nasir Sabaa, 58, a fish trader. ``But we think of the men who died, too, and we are very sorry. It is bad for America. But it is bad for Yemen, too, because the terrorists who want to destroy you want to destroy Yemen, as well.''

Using descriptions from fishermen and other witnesses, Yemeni investigators have created composite sketches of two suspects in the USS Cole bombing, sources close to the investigation said Saturday. The sketches will be sent to Egypt and Saudi Arabia, where they will be checked against photographs of Arab veterans of the anti-Soviet rebellion in Afghanistan, the sources said on condition of anonymity. The Oct. 12 attack on the Cole killed 17 U.S. sailors and wounded 39 others in the port of Aden. Officials believe two suicide bombers maneuvered a small boat next to the destroyer and detonated explosives. Yemen's president has said one of the two suspects was identified by witnesses as an Egyptian and that a number of Arab fighters from the Afghanistan war have been detained in connection with the blast. The sources said artists from the Yemeni capital, San`a, drew the sketches based on conversations with fishermen whom the two suspects had quizzed about comings and goings of ships in the harbor. The artists also spoke to landlords of at least three properties where the men prepared for the bombing, and to a 12-year-old boy that one suspect paid to watch his car before the blast. Witnesses have described the two suspects as well-built and said one had a beard and wore glasses. Also Saturday, retired U.S. Army Gen. William W. Crouch and retired Navy Adm. Harold W. Gehman Jr. arrived in Aden to review military procedures, protection and intelligence gathering in Yemen, the U.S. Defense Department said in a statement. The review will be conducted separately, but in coordination with, an FBI-led investigation. Crouch and Gehman toured the Cole, but refused to talk to reporters about their mission. The damaged Cole is still docked in Aden. It is to be carried back to the United States on a special ``heavy-lift'' ship that is expected to reach the port by Sunday. If terrorism is proved, the bombing would be the deadliest attack on the U.S. military since 19 Air Force personnel died in a 1996 truck bomb explosion in Saudi Arabia. Also Saturday, Yemeni Interior Minister Hussein Mohammed Arab said it has not been established whether the Egyptian suspect belongs to Al Qaeda. That group is led by Osama Bin Laden, the Saudi millionaire singled out by the United States as a terrorist leader. Speaking in Saudi Arabia, Arab said the investigations have ``achieved great positive results.'' He also said no Saudi nationals took part in the bombing. Yemeni security are handling the investigation, Arab said, and ``the Americans have no interference'' in the probe, ``except for some questions that they could pose to Yemeni investigators who in turn perform the investigations,'' he said. Arab's remarks were the most detailed the Yemenis have offered on the U.S role in the probe. His comments came a day after U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and FBI Director Louis Freeh appealed in a joint statement for greater cooperation from the Yemeni government. A senior U.S. official in Aden said Saturday that the Americans are not displeased with the Yemenis' level of cooperation.

Russian and Norwegian divers on Sunday recovered several more bodies from the sunken Russian nuclear submarine Kursk, the navy said. The divers worked through the night inside the eighth and ninth compartments of the submarine, searching for more of the 118 men killed when the Kursk was shattered by an explosion and sank on Aug. 12. Several of the sailors were found and retrieved, said Vadim Serga, the Northern Fleet spokesman. The number of bodies and their identities remained unclear, he said, apparently because the remains were badly damaged. Four other bodies had already been pulled out Wednesday. The divers struggled Saturday to cut a hole through the hull above the Kursk's ninth compartment, at the very stern of the submarine, but the thick rubber and steel would not yield, Serga said. Divers were forced to enter through a hole they had cut earlier in the eighth compartment and grope their way back into the ninth compartment through silt concealing jagged edges of mangled metal inside the Kursk. After days of heavy winds and snowfall, skies over the Arctic rescue site cleared enough this weekend to allow helicopters to bring the four bodies recovered Wednesday to the town of Severomorsk for a mourning ceremony. Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev, speaking at the service where caskets containing the remains of the four were placed atop armored personnel carriers, said the cause of the disaster must be found to avoid any repetition of the sinking. He said the Kursk crew was the best in Russia's submarine fleet. ``The crew loved the Motherland, the sea and the fleet. They inherited the best of the navy's traditions,'' Sergeyev said. ``They understood the need to serve their country and carried out their duty. Forgive us and farewell.'' Deputy Prime Minister Ilya Klebanov said the remains of all the crew members would be recovered and the submarine itself will be raised from the floor of the Barents Sea. He said the cause of the sinking will be found, and the families of the crew will be the first to know. Many Russians have questioned the need for the risky, expensive recovery effort. It has revived the emotional debate over how Russian authorities handled the accident, including the two-day delay in announcing the accident and longer wait before accepting foreign help in the failed rescue attempt. ``Maybe they shouldn't have retrieved the bodies,'' Russian Orthodox priest Daniil Topolev, who served the first liturgy for the Kursk sailors after the accident, said Saturday. ``You can compare this to as if people have been already buried, and then uncovered again.'' Officials had found a note in the pocket of one of the recovered submariners saying that 23 sailors had remained trapped alive in the ninth compartment for at least several hours after the powerful explosions that sank the submarine Aug. 12. Topolev, speaking on the grounds of his small church in the Barents port of Murmansk, near Severomorsk, said the fact that some of the sailors did not die immediately was significant in Orthodox tradition. ``They had time to repent. That's already good. Those who died at once, maybe they had time to cross themselves and say: Lord, save us. And those who remained, could repent,'' he said. The cause of the disaster has not been determined. Russian officials have focused on the theory that the blasts were set off by a collision with another, possibly foreign, ship. But others have said the most likely cause was a torpedo exploding in its tube.

Trucks filled with riot police were parked near polling stations in Egypt Sunday as voters elected a parliament. The tight security, which included scores of plainclothes police officers on the streets of Zagazig, 40 miles northeast of Cairo, followed violence during earlier voting that left one person dead amid charges of fraud and intimidation. But there was no sign of violence as voting got off to a slow start in Zagazig. A total of 134 seats were being contested in Sunday's voting in southern and eastern Egypt. This second stage of voting followed polling Oct. 18 in northern Egypt. A third and last stage is scheduled Nov. 8 in central Egypt and the new 454-member legislature is to convene in mid-December. For the first time, the election was staggered to allow a small pool of judges time to travel across the country to supervise voting. In the past, civil servants had augmented the judicial supervisors. That practice was declared unconstitutional this year following widespread charges of vote-rigging in the last elections in 1995, which were among the most violent in Egypt's history. Civil rights groups welcomed the switch to having only judges supervise what happens inside the polling booths, but some have expressed concern that the Ministry of Interior, which is controlled by the ruling National Democratic Party, is still responsible for compiling voter lists and transporting ballots from the polling stations to counting areas. The NDP denied the rigging charges in 1995, but courts ruled there had been fraud in many cases. President Hosni Mubarak's NDP emerged from the first round of this year's voting with 118 of the 150 seats contested. Opposition parties won four, independents endorsed by the banned Muslim Brotherhood won another six and other independents won 20. Voting in a two-seat constituency in Alexandria was indefinitely postponed after a brotherhood-backed candidate complained she did not get a fair chance because police arrested several of her campaign workers. The brotherhood, considered Egypt's largest Muslim political group, won only one seat in 1995. It supports nominally independent candidates because it is outlawed. Its platform is to run the country as an Islamic state. The ruling party has such a stranglehold on Egyptian politics that isn't unusual for scores of nominal independents to declare themselves NDP members after victories _ as happened after the first round this year. But several prominent ruling party politicians were defeated in the first round, an indication of voter discontent with a party seen as moving slowly on economic and human rights reforms. Recent Palestinian-Israel violence has also become a campaign issue, with thousands of Egyptians protesting in support of the Palestinians and calling on their government _ one of only two in the Arab world with a peace treaty with Israel _ to take a harder line on the Jewish state. But with no viable opposition, the NDP is expected to again emerge as by far the largest bloc in parliament. The party held 97 percent of the 454 seats in the departing parliament. A total of 4,259 candidates have registered to run for 444 seats across Egypt. The 10 remaining seats are filled by presidential appointment.

The state Republican Committee said Sunday that its telephone campaign on behalf of Rick Lazio's Senate bid would no longer include calls that referred to the bombing of the USS Cole to try to suggest that some of Hillary Rodham Clinton's donors supported terrorism. The calls including that reference, which Clinton had harshly criticized as politicizing a tragedy, ended sometime Saturday after the chairman of the party, William Powers, determined the script had run its course and not because of the criticism, a spokesman for Powers said. The spokesman, Dan Allen, said Powers felt it had reached enough voters, though he could not provide an estimate for how many people had been called. Altogether, a broader telephone campaign, which began Thursday and was to continue for an undisclosed time, was expected to reach 500,000 people. State party officials say the telephone campaign will continue with other calls, including some aimed at Jewish voters that question Clinton's commitment to Israel. Clinton, campaigning in Rochester Sunday with Sen. Charles Schumer, said the decision to end the calls referring to the Cole bombing was not good enough. She repeated her demand of Saturday that Lazio and the Republican Party ``do the honorable thing and apologize.'' Lazio refused on Saturday and then again Sunday, saying the Clinton campaign was trying to deflect attention from questionable donations. ``That is so typical,'' Clinton said of the GOP decision, ``They should have stopped the calls yesterday when they were caught making those calls. They should clearly take responsibility, as should Mr. Lazio. I believe both Congressman Lazio and the state Republican Party still owe an apology to the families that lost their sons and daughters and loved ones on the USS Cole.'' Both Jews and non-Jews have received calls. The pitch to non-Jews included a line saying Clinton accepted money from an organization that ``openly brags about its support for a Mideast terrorism group _ the same kind of terrorism that killed our sailors on the USS Cole.'' The reference is to contributions Clinton accepted from leaders of the American Muslim Alliance at a fund-raiser in Boston in June. Clinton returned the money, $50,000, after learning that the group's leader was quoted as defending a United Nations resolution he interpreted as allowing Palestinians to take up arms against Israel. American investigators say the Oct. 12 explosion on the Cole, which killed 17 sailors, was most likely caused by terrorists but they have not linked the blast to any organization. The calls to Jewish voters, Allen said, asked if they knew that before Clinton entered the Senate race last year she ``supported a Palestinian state and didn't support moving the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem?'' Clinton said in June 1999 that she wanted the embassy moved as soon as possible, and has said she supports a Palestinian state as part of a broad peace plan for the region. Allen said the change in the script did not have anything to do with criticism of the content, saying instead that the party is always reviewing and ``tinkering'' with scripts. Future calls, state party officials say, will raise questions about Clinton's positions on health care, taxes and other subjects. The change came to light through Lazio, who after speaking at Abyssinian Baptist Church in Harlem, told reporters in response to questions about the calls referring to the Cole, ``I don't think they're going to continue to make those phone calls.'' A spokesman for Lazio, Patrick McCarthy, said the congressman, who has denied his campaign is involved in the phone drive, had heard about the change ``through the grapevine.'' Lazio refused to answer questions on whether it was appropriate to use the Cole in the telephone campaign. But he sought to keep the focus on Clinton's accepting what he has termed ``blood money.'' ``The Clinton campaign is desperately trying to change the subject that they received donations, and Mrs. Clinton attended a fund-raiser, involving people that were supportive of the idea of using violence and murder as a tool to achieve political ends,'' Lazio said.

Ivory Coast's main opposition leader Alisan Ouattara is calling for an international inquiry into the massacre of dozens of people found in a mass grave. Nancy Paulis reports from Abidjan. Mr. Ouattara's rally of the Republican's party or RDR describes the killings as a form of ethnic cleansing. The bodies of more than 50 young men, identified as RDR supporters from the Abovo suburb of Abidjan, were discovered Thursday in a wooded area outside the city. More than 100 people have died in ethnic clashes since Thursday. The latest fighting was touched off when supporters of Mr. Ouattara took to the streets, demanding new elections after the fall of military leader Robert Guei, earlier in the week. Mr. Ouattara had been barred from last Sunday's elections, which were widely regarded has flawed. During the clashes, Thursday, police attacked RDR supporters, in predominantly Jewish sections of Abovo. Witnesses say they saw police round up scores, abused, stripped them, then dragged them to the area police camp where they executed them. Nancy Paulis for VOA News, Abidjan.

The US navy destroyer damaged apparently by a terrorist bomb while refueling at the Red Sea port, Aden has begun it's journey back to the States for repair. As Dave Gavlak reports, the US Cole was towed out of the Aden harbor to awaiting Norwegian transport ship, that will actually carry the damaged destroyer home. The American national anthem played as four tug boats pulled the USS Cole slowly out of Yemen's Southern port of Aden. The Cole was badly damaged two weeks ago in an apparent suicide bombing that killed 17 US sailors. Security was tight as the ship was towed out. American and Yemeni patrol boats mounted with machine guns escorted the Cole out to open waters while American helicopters flew overhead. Some Yemenis expressed relief to see the ship leave. Many locals said they feared the bombing of the ship would serve as an excuse for continued US military presence in the Gulf country. Diplomats and analysts have commented that a joint investigation into the attack may in fact strengthen ties between the world super power and the poor, but strategic Arab state. US and Yemeni officials say they believe Islamic militants may have carried out the bombing. So far two little known Islamic groups have claimed responsibility for the attack. Yemeni authorities claimed they have detained over 70 people for questioning. These include some Afghan-Arab volunteers who came to Yemen after fighting against Soviet forces in Afghanistan in the 1980s. Dave Gavlak for VOA News, Cairo.

Russia has paid tribute to the 118 sailors killed in the August sinking of the Kursk nuclear submarine. As divers retrieve more bodies from the wreck on the bottom of the Barents Sea. The bodies of four sailors were recovered last week and on Sunday, four armored cars carried those remains through the military town of Severodvinsk to a memorial service. Russian Defense Minister, Igor Sergaev, paid tribute to the submariners during a ceremony while asking those gathered for forgiveness. Russians Vladimir Putin did not go to Sunday's ceremony, but instead attended a service in Moscow for more than 80 people who died last week in a military plane crash in neighboring Georgia.

Ivory Coast's main opposition leader Alasan Ouattara is calling for an international inquiry into the massacre of dozens of people found in a mass grave near Abidjan. Authorities have vowed to track down and punish those responsible for the killings. Witnesses blame the killings on security forces loyal to newly installed President Loran Gbagbo. Ouattara followers clashed last week with Gbagbo supporters after the outster of the country's military ruler. The Ouattara followers are calling for new elections saying last Sunday's vote was marred since Mr. Ouattara was debarred from running. Meanwhile, Abidjan is slowly returning to normal though tension remains as people across the city fear a return to violence. This is VOA News Now.

Security was heavy and enthusiasm light in Zagazig, where many residents chose to skip voting Sunday in parliamentary elections for lawmakers to represent their impoverished city in the farmlands outside Cairo. In this crowded city 40 miles northeast of the capital, like other towns around Egypt voting in Sunday's election _ the second of three stages _ authorities were on the lookout for any sign of trouble. Egyptian elections have a history of violence, and one person was killed and dozens were wounded in first-round voting earlier this month that involved accusations of fraud and intimidation. Scores of plainclothes police officers walked the streets of Zagazig and trucks filled with riot police parked near polling stations. It wasn't clear whether the heavy security, logistical difficulties or the likelihood of a run-off had deterred voters, but polling officials said turnout was light. Voting took place in nine governing regions: Aswan, Dakahliya, Damietta, Gharbiyah, Kafr el-Sheik, North Sinai, the Red Sea, Sharqiya, and South Sinai. The only report of violence Sunday was a brawl between supporters of independent candidate Mortada Mansour, and those of a ruling National Democratic Party candidate, Abdul-Rahman Baraka, in the Nile Delta city of Mansoura. Two people were injured in the fight. As Atef Rashed left a polling station in Zagazig in Sharqiya district, the 26-year-old doctor said he was pleased with the voting process. ``The security forces did not present any difficulties,'' he said. ``There was total freedom in the process. I wasn't pressured or harassed by anyone as we had read happened in the last stage.'' Elsewhere earlier this month during the first stage of voting, security officers were accused of turning away voters in areas considered strongholds of the banned Muslim Brotherhood. However, even the often critical brotherhood candidates were satisfied with Sunday's proceedings in Sharqiya. ``To say the truth, the judges are keeping their end of the bargain. The voting procedures inside the polling stations have been exemplary,'' said brotherhood candidate Mohamed Morsi. For the first time, the parliamentary election has been staggered to allow a pool of judges time to travel across the country to supervise voting. In the past, civil servants had augmented judicial supervisors _ a practice declared unconstitutional this year following widespread charges of vote-rigging in 1995 elections that were among the most violent in Egypt's history. Turnout figures and results were expected Monday. Out of the 150 first-round races, 121 were settled in run-off votes. Ultimately, President Hosni Mubarak's National Democratic Party emerged from the round with 118 of the 150 seats. Opposition parties won four, independents endorsed by the Muslim Brotherhood won six and other independents won 20. A total of 4,259 candidates have registered to run for 444 seats across Egypt. The 10 remaining seats are filled by presidential appointment.

The sixth U.S. warship damaged by hostile action in the Middle East in 33 years, the destroyer USS Cole also is the second to return home riding piggyback on a larger vessel. The technique was previously used in 1988 to transport the missile frigate USS Samuel B. Roberts after it was nearly sunk by an Iranian mine in the Persian Gulf. The carrier that time was a chartered Dutch cargo vessel. Over the weekend, the 8,600-ton Cole was towed from its mooring in Aden's harbor to an offshore rendezvous with the Norwegian heavy-lift ship Blue Marlin and the start of its 6,000-mile trip back to the East Coast. The Cole, one of the Navy's most advanced combat ships, was refueling at Aden on Oct. 12 when an explosives-laden suicide boat blasted a hole in its side, killing 17 sailors and injuring 39. Two terrorists on the boat also apparently perished. In saving their wounded ship, the Cole's crew evoked memories of the Roberts and a sister ship, USS Stark, both victims of hostile action during the Iraq-Iran ``tanker war'' in the Persian Gulf in the late 1980s. At 3,700 tons less than half the Cole's size, with less armor, and alone at sea when attacked, the two frigates were even luckier to survive. The Stark was patrolling Gulf waters the night of May 17, 1987, when hit by two French-made Exocet anti-ship missiles fired by an Iraqi warplane hunting Iranian tankers. The attack killed 37 sailors, some in their bunks. Crewmen quelled raging fires and the crippled ship was towed to port, where it was repaired enough to return home under its own power. Iraq apologized, but the incident spurred the United States to bolster its tiny Gulf naval force and provide convoy escort for reflagged Kuwaiti oil tankers. Eleven months later, on April 14, 1988, the Roberts stumbled into an Iranian minefield in mid-Gulf and was gingerly backing out when a blast ruptured its keel, hurled twin gas turbine engines off their mounts and wounded 10 crewmen. Working in darkness, crewmen saved the Roberts by lashing its nearly severed hull together with steel cables. The skipper, Cmdr. Paul X. Rinn, and his sailors were hailed as heroes who rewrote the book on damage control. In a one-day war of retaliation, the United States destroyed two oil platforms and sank or crippled six gunboats used by Iran to attack Gulf shipping. After two months in a Dubai drydock, the Roberts was piggybacked on the Dutch cargo ship Mighty Servant 2 and taken back to Maine, where it was rebuilt for $90 million. Like the Stark, it returned to duty a year later. Innovations in tools, techniques and training resulting from those incidents may have helped save the Cole, said Cmdr. Greg Smith, a Navy spokesman. ``It's too soon to know exactly what, but the Navy never fails to take advantage of lessons learned in such cases,'' he said. Like the Mighty Servant 2, the 56,000-ton Blue Marlin is a state-of-the-art heavy-lift ship, with a 584-foot main deck that can be submerged 32 feet to take on a floating cargo. The Cole, 466 feet long, was to be put aboard on Monday for a trip that could take five weeks, officials said. The Blue Marlin, owned by an Oslo firm, recently delivered several small minesweepers to the U.S. 5th Fleet in the Persian Gulf, and was in Dubai when given a $4.5 million Navy contract to transport the destroyer back to the United States. In addition to Roberts and Stark, U.S. warships damaged by hostilities in the Middle East include the spy ship USS Liberty, attacked by Israel in the Mediterranean during the 1967 Six-Day War, and the missile cruiser USS Princeton and mine warfare support ship USS Inchon, both victims of minor mine damage during the 1991 Gulf War. The Cole may go back to the Mississippi shipyard where it was built, or another facility in Maine. It could cost $150 million to repair the $1 billion warship, the Navy says.

Japan and North Korea on Monday opened their third round of talks this year on normalizing relations, as Tokyo tries not to fall behind U.S. and South Korean efforts to improve ties with the isolated communist nation. Japanese chief negotiator Kojiro Takano welcomed his North Korean counterpart, Jong Thae Hwa, at Japan's embassy on neutral territory in Beijing for the first of two days of talks aimed at laying the groundwork for a future agreement. Japan, which ruled the Korean Peninsula as a colony from 1910 to the end of World War II in 1945, has never had normal diplomatic ties with North Korea, and intensely emotional issues still divide the two. The two previous rounds of talks have sputtered over North Korea's insistence on compensation for Japan's often brutal occupation and Tokyo's demands for information on Japanese citizens allegedly abducted to North Korea to train spies. Still, there's a sense of urgency in Tokyo, with the talks coming on the heels of historic visits to Pyongyang by U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and South Korea's President Kim Dae-jung. Germany, Britain and Spain have also made moves to normalize ties with the North. Some in Japan fear North Korean leader Kim Jong Il's recent success in reaching out to other nations may even encourage him to take a harder line with Tokyo. North Korea broke off earlier talks on ties eight years ago after angrily rejecting Tokyo's demands to track down 10 Japanese citizens allegedly abducted by Northern agents. Although talks finally resumed in April, Tokyo and Pyongyang still don't see eye to eye over the abduction issue. North Korea has denied abducting anyone. A public outcry was raised in Japan over press reports Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori may have backed a face-saving compromise raised three years ago. The deal would have allowed any Japanese in the North to return via a third country without Pyongyang having to admit wrongdoing. A compromise may also be in the offing over Japanese colonization of the Korean Peninsula. The North Korean delegation is expected to press Japan for an official apology and compensation for the occupation. Although Japan has rejected the demands, it has expressed willingness to extend economic aid, as it did upon normalizing relations with South Korea in 1965. Since the last round of talks in August, Japan has said it will send half a million tons of rice over the next two years to help ease acute food shortages in the North. Japan's media have speculated that offers of hefty aid packages may tempt Pyongyang into overcoming any reluctance about signing a normalization agreement. Japanese negotiators are also likely to address North Korea's missile program, which sent a three-stage missile sailing over northern Japan two years ago.

Gov. Mel Carnahan's widow declared Monday she will accept appointment to Missouri's U.S. Senate seat if voters pick him over Republican incumbent John Ashcroft next week. Jean Carnahan, 66, has never run for or held public office but was offered a Senate appointment by Gov. Roger Wilson if Missouri voters choose the governor who died in an Oct. 16 plane crash. ``With the support of my family and an abiding faith in a living God, I've decided to do what Mel would have wanted us to do ... to continue the fight for his ideals,'' said Mrs. Carnahan, standing on a back porch at the family farm in Rolla. Mrs. Carnahan's announcement came two weeks to the day after Carnahan, 66, the Carnahans' eldest son, Roger, 44, and Carnahan adviser Chris Sifford, 37, died when a small plane piloted by Roger Carnahan crashed outside St. Louis on the way to a campaign rally. Relatives stood behind Mrs. Carnahan at the announcement, which she said followed days of consultation with her family. ``A vote for Mel Carnahan is a vote they can make,'' she said. ``They still have a choice.'' Media polls taken after Mel Carnahan's burial showed the Senate race still statistically tied, as it had been for months. But the polls showed Mrs. Carnahan leading Ashcroft slightly when participants were told about Wilson's offer to appoint her senator.

Russian naval officials have ordered divers to shift their search for remains from the aft section of the sunken nuclear submarine Kursk to its front, naval officials said Tuesday. The spokesman for the Russian Northern Fleet, Capt. Vladimir Navrotsky, said officials judged a further search of the aft section to be too risky. Divers had stopped their search of the submarine's ninth compartment, he said. ``The divers have done all they could,'' Navrotsky said. ``Further efforts would be too dangerous for the divers.'' However, he said there was still hope of recovering remains from the front of the Kursk _ contradicting officials' earlier statements that seamen there had almost certainly been blown to pieces when the Kursk's weapons detonated in a powerful explosion, equal in force to a 3.5-magnitude earthquake. ``We believe there is still a chance of finding bodies in the third compartment,'' Navrotsky said. Others alleged that the search for bodies was a cover for attempts to retrieve sensitive equipment and documents. ``It goes without saying that first of all they are looking for documents and secret equipment,'' said Mikhail Guzun, a retired naval officer in the Arctic seaport of Murmansk. ``There is both machinery and equipment that should not fall into foreigners' hands.'' Navrotsky denied that. Still, by moving to the front of the submarine, naval officials may be hoping to gather clues on what caused the Aug. 12 disaster that killed the Kursk's 118 crewmen. Russian officials have focused on the theory that the blasts were set off by a collision with another, possibly foreign, ship during exercises in the Barents Sea. But others have said the most likely cause was a torpedo exploding in its tube. Teams of Russian and Norwegian divers have so far recovered 12 bodies. They focused their work in the stern after finding a seaman's note indicating that at least 23 sailors had survived for hours after the initial blasts that sank the sub. The survivors had gathered in the ninth and last compartment, where the emergency escape hatch was located, the note said. In Moscow, navy spokesman Capt. Igor Dygalo said Tuesday that the ninth compartment was too confined for the divers to continue their work. ``Minimum safe passages should be at least 70 centimeters (28 inches) wide. At present moment, they are 55 centimeters (22 inches) wide, making further work too dangerous for the divers,'' Dygalo said. He said the divers had covered a hole they cut in the submarine's hull over the eighth compartment with a special steel cover and also shut the exit hatch in the ninth compartment, conserving the wreck. Throughout the 10-day operation, the divers have been at risk of ripping their pressure suits and air hoses on their machinery. Meanwhile, the weather at the disaster site started to improve on Tuesday, lifting hopes that the seamen's remains could be flown from the divers' mother ship, Regalia, to the mainland for identification and burial. The first four bodies were brought to shore for a memorial ceremony on Sunday, but the others were stranded because bad weather hampered helicopter flights. Officials said Tuesday that forensic expertise had confirmed the identity of Lt. Dmitry Kolesnikov, in whose pocket the note was found. Kolesnikov's body was flown to his native city of St. Petersburg for burial. After more than two months underwater, the bodies have been severely damaged, complicating identification, officials said. They will not be released to relatives for burial until forensic experts complete their work.

Dozens of court employees stood in silence outside Spain's Supreme Court on Tuesday, expressing outrage over the killing of three colleagues, including a judge, in the most brutal attack blamed on Basque separatists this year. The five-minute midday silent vigil, customary in Spain in recent years after terrorist attacks, was also staged by people outside workplaces across the country. Earlier in the day, Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar and a host of other Spanish leaders joined the mourning relatives of two of the dead _ slain judge Francisco Querol and his chauffeur, Armando Medina _ for a funeral Mass in one of the court's chambers. The funeral for the third victim of Monday's blast, the judge's police bodyguard, Jesus Escudero Garcia, was held Tuesday in the southern city of Granada. The three men were killed Monday morning when a car bomb exploded as their vehicle passed through a busy Madrid residential area during rush hour. The bomb planted in a neighboring car blew the judge's vehicle over a bus and onto the pavement, setting other cars in the area ablaze and smashing windows in some 500 apartments and shops. Twelve of the 34 people injured in the attack remained in hospitals Tuesday. One man, a city bus driver, was still in serious condition. Querol was due to retire from the Supreme Court next month on his 70th birthday. Although no group claimed responsibility for the attack, authorities immediately blamed the Basque separatist group ETA. The group has often used car bombs as part of its 32-year-old campaign for an independent Basque state that would encompass parts of northern Spain and southwest France. ``The terrorists are trying to press the accelerator and upset all,'' Interior Minister Jaime Mayor Oreja told Onda Cero private radio Tuesday. ``They think that (with) this rhythm, contradictory as it may seem, they will reach their objective.'' The attack was condemned by all political parties except the Basque independence group linked to ETA, Euskal Herritarrok. It said the bomb was further evidence that negotiations were needed to solve the region's conflict. On Monday, Aznar urged Spaniards not to despair over ETA's continuing violence. He stood firm by his policy of ruling out talks and combatting the group through police measures. ``It is clear that no one will achieve any kind of objective through the force of violence, and that no one will make Spaniards yield to threats of guns, whoever may be holding them,'' said Aznar, who survived an ETA assassination attempt in 1995. Aznar was to join other political leaders for a major demonstration Tuesday evening in Madrid. Other protests are expected to take place in cities throughout Spain. Monday's attack was the deadliest attributed to ETA since the organization ended a 14-month cease-fire last December. It is now blamed for 19 slayings in 10 months _ six in October alone. ETA has claimed the killing of some 800 people in all. The group usually admits responsibility for its attacks weeks later in statements to pro-independence Basque media.

good evening. it is a tragic event today that has moved the presidential campaign out of the top spot this evening. such was the case of disaster and near disaster for other at chiang kai shek airport in taipei, the capitol of taiwan. singapore airlines flight 006 bound for los angeles with 179 people on board, including 47 americans, was rushing down the runway when disaster struck. at least 65 died. the rest of the story from abc's mark litke. on the tarmac, the inferno that was singapore airline's flight 006, this video shot from the window of another aircraft nearby. the l.a.-bound 747 had begun its takeoff only seconds before. in near-typhoon conditions, with heavy wind and rain, survivors say that the plane seemed to be at full power when they heard a loud noise. it was shaking, you know, from this wind. the moment he reached the high speed to get up off the ground, boom, everything was upside-down. all of a sudden, this plane broke up flames again gulfing the aircraft. it started skidding with smoke. i was afraid i would burn alive. many of the surviving passengers managed to escape through the rear of the plane. survivors were taken to nearby hospitals. others are serious injuries. rescue teams worked through the night to recover bodies trapped in the gutted wreckage. a major typhoon has been bearing down on taipei today, and several other flights had reportedly been canceled because of the weather. severe wind gusting up to 65 miles per hour may have affected the jet. but the airline says the crash may have been caused by an object on the runway. the flight commander on board the aircraft reported hitting an object on the takeoff run. in fact, sources tell abc news that the pilot, who did survive, said he thought he was about to hit something on the runway, so he quickly brought up the nose of the jet to avoid it. moments later, flight 006 was in flames. mark litke, abc news. hong kong.

in the persian gulf tonight, american troops in kuwait and saudi arabia, 10,000 of them, have been put on the highest state of alert. these are important places and the pentag said today it has picked up a credible terrorist threat. abc's john m wethy is at the pentagon night. he has been monitoring the salvage operation of the "uss cole." the navy today provided its own video of the "uss cole" being maneuvered onto the flooded deck of the giant salvage ship, the "blue marlin." as the "blue marlin's" ballast tanks were pumped out, its deck was raised beneath the crippled ship, lifting the "cole" out of the water. the 500-foot-long warship was placed aan angle so its propeller in the rear and its underwater sonar dome in the front would hang over the side. using steel braces, the "cole" is being welded to the deck of the "blue marlin" for the long ride home around africa. because of security concerns, it will not go through the suez canal. the navy estimates it will cost at least $150 million to repair the ship. but pentagon sources say damage, especially to the keel, may be greater than first believed. this $1 billion warship, officials warn, may have to be scrapped. as for cooperation between the u.s. and yemen, it seemed to break down completely today. yemen's government, apparently reacting to what it perceives as american arrogance, refused to allow any u.s. navy helicopters to land on its soil. that left american investigators stranded out on warships where they now live. and one more concern -- abc news has learned american officials now believe yemen authorities erased critical parts of a videotape taken by a harbor surveillance camera the day the "cole" was hit. increasingly, american officials wonder if yemen's government might have something to hide. john m wethy, abc news, the pentagon.

WASHINGTON (AP) _ U.S. Navy ships have stopped using the Suez Canal, the usual route from the eastern United States to the Persian Gulf, out of concern for terrorist threats, senior U.S. defense officials said Tuesday. No U.S. Navy ship has used the 101-mile canal since the USS Cole made its way from the Mediterranean Sea into the Red Sea shortly before it was attacked by terrorists in the Yemeni port of Aden on Oct. 12. Also on Tuesday, U.S. officials said American troops in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait have been placed on the highest state of alert, following intelligence indications of terrorist threats that are considered credible. The specific target of the threats was not immediately clear. U.S. forces elsewhere in the Gulf region _ including Bahrain, Qatar and Yemen _ already were on the highest state of alert, following the Cole bombing. It was unclear how long Navy ships would avoid the Suez. One defense official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said some planned trips through the canal have been scrapped since the Cole bombing, and future scheduled trips will be considered on a case-by-case basis. Col. Brian Hoey, spokesman for the U.S. Central Command, said Monday night that the American government is ``working very closely with the Egyptian government to ensure ongoing security arrangements are appropriate'' at the canal. Meantime, President Clinton and the State Department's top anti-terrorism official are urging Yemen to give U.S. investigators more access to witnesses, suspects and evidence in the Cole bombing investigation. The intricate process of preparing the Cole for its return voyage to the United States, meanwhile, continued as the heavy-lift ship Blue Marlin worked to secure the Cole onto its main deck. Pentagon officials said the process likely would take a few more days. Once it is ready to go, the Blue Marlin will travel around the southern tip of Africa in order to avoid the Suez Canal, defense officials said. Clinton said Monday that Yemen had cooperated fully in the preliminary, first phase of the investigation of the Oct. 12 attack that killed 17 American sailors and injured 39. But, the president said, ``there have been difficulties now.'' And, Clinton said, ``I hope that we can work it out.'' On Tuesday, Michael A. Sheehan, coordinator of the State Department counterterrorism office, said that while Yemen had the authority and responsibility to conduct the investigation ``we would like to be privy'' to more of it. ``Normally,'' Sheehan said at a breakfast meeting with reporters, ``the United States doesn't have the right to question witnesses.'' But in some situations U.S. investigators have had direct access to suspects and ``we are urging them to cooperate and hope that they will,'' he said. Clinton said Monday there were some ``promising leads,'' and that prompt action was essential because ``the trail can get cold.'' Sheehan declined to provide any information on what investigators may have found out. ``It's not clear what happened,'' he said. But, he added: ``My guess is that it (the attack) was not state-sponsored.'' ``I don't know who did it,'' the State Department official said. ``Anyone in the U.S. government who says he knows doesn't.'' Asked if Osama bin Laden, a Saudi expatriate accused of heading a terrorism network, was behind the attack, Sheehan said ``it's not useful to speculate.'' In Afghanistan, where bin Laden has taken refuge, Taliban Foreign Minister Wakil Ahmed Muttawakil said Monday: ``We don't expect that America would attack us. ``But,'' he said, ``we are not afraid of any attack. Being Muslims, we are ready to greet death at any time.'' Sheehan said the United States held Taliban accountable for providing sanctuary for terrorist organizations. If the bin Laden group or any other there is found responsible for bombing the Cole ``we are going to make life miserable for them,'' Sheehan said. The United States has demanded that Afghanistan's ruling Taliban militia hand bin Laden over for trial on terrorism charges in the August 1998 bombings of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. Those attacks killed 224 people. Shortly after the embassy attacks, the United States fired dozens of Tomahawk cruise missiles at bin Laden's suspected stronghold in eastern Afghanistan. Bin Laden has denied involvement in the embassy bombings, and the Taliban say the United States has not substantiated the charges against him.

From NPR News in Washington, I am Corey Flintoff. Emergency officials in Taiwan say at least 65 people have been killed in a fiery crash on the runway. The plane was a Singapore Airlines Jumbo Jet that apparently struck an object on the runway as it tried to takeoff on a flight to Los Angeles. At least 84 people were injured. An Airlines spokesman said that 47 of the passengers were U.S. citizens and 55 were Taiwanese. The crash occurred in bad weather, which hampered the work of crews who were trying to account for all the people aboard the plane.

Elsewhere, in the Middle East, the investigation into this month's deadly bombing of the USS Cole off the coast of Yemen is focussing on four men. Today's sources close to the investigation said that Yemeni investigators are exploring possible links between the suspects and Muslim militants. American officials are pressing for a greater role in the investigation. The Clinton administration wants US agents to have direct access to witnesses, suspects, and evidence. Allen Cyprus is covering the story for the Washington Post in Aden. Allen, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said that the US wants more access. What are US agents not being allowed to do? Who can they not talk to? At this point, we are being told that FBI agents are not allowed to question possible suspects or possible witnesses. In fact, that there are not even in the room when those questions are posed. From the Yemeni point of view, this is a matter of sovereignty, but the two sides are trying to work out some kind of arrangement in which Americans may be able to observe the questioning even if they don't participate in it. Perhaps, Americans would understand it better if it were American suspects being questioned by interrogators from outside. Yemenis here say that they have been working hard to co-operate with the Americans, particularly in the face of gathering evidence, but the Yemenis should be questioned by Yemenis. Is it difficult at the same time for reporters to find out what's going on? I know there are some reporters who have handlers or minders as you try to talk to witnesses, is that the case with you? It has been the case, all the reporters staying here in Aden have been assigned minders from the security services here in Yemen, and that makes it a little difficult to move around freely and to interview people, but by hook or by crook we sometimes can get enough free space to talk to people. And the job is not impossible, but its certainly more difficult than it might be a number of other countries in the Middle East, and it's more difficult than it typically is here in Yemen. And when we make the American comparison again, it would be hard to see how may be the FBI or police would stand in the way of foreign reporters talking to witnesses here on this end. What is the rationale given there? There are a number of different rationales, the first one that were given is that they are worried about our security, they have already seen 17 Americans killed here and they don't want to see any more incidents like that, but its hard to accept that at face value. More likely they are trying to control what is a sudden influx of foreigners into their country, and to control the information that comes out of this country. Are there any new developments then as far as the suspects are concerned? I mean, do we know more about them or who else behind the attack on the USS Cole? Not a great deal more than what we did a few days ago. The most significant statement we have heard in recent days is that from the president of Yemen, Ali Abdullah Saleh who said that one of the suspects is believed to be an Egyptian, or at least that what's the preliminary investigation shows. We are in the phase now of questioning suspects, of slowly gathering information. We hear reports that there are perhaps 2 people involved, perhaps 4 people involved, perhaps more than that. We hear reports of multiple stay houses, we hear reports of investigations going beyond Yemen's borders to other Gulf countries. But at this point, that's very hard for us to confirm. You did some interesting reporting the day the USS Cole left last week and you spoke with some of the people who were standing by the port, and in some cases, there were certain people who basically bid good riddance to it. Can you tell us about some of the comments that you heard from Yemenis? I should by saying I did not hear any people say that they were happy that there had been an attack against the USS Cole. But from the minute that the military came in to follow up after the attacking, and the moment the FBI started arriving here, there was a great deal of apprehension among Yemenis that this was a secret plot to establish an American base in Yemen. I think a lot of Yemenis were relieved to see the Americans go at this time. And in particular at a time when there is a fair bit of animosity towards the United States because of its support for Israel in the current clashes with the Palestinians. Journalist Allen Cyprus of the Washington Post, speaking to us from Aden in Yemen. Thank you very much for the update. Not at all, thank you.

A Singapore Airlines's jumbo jet crashed in flames today as it took off from Taiwan. James Boyd is spokesmen for the Airline. I can confirm the flight number SQ006 from Taipei to Los Angeles with 159 passengers and 20 crew onboard had an incident on the runway during take off as the Flight Commander on board the aircraft reported hitting an object on the takeoff run. Rescuers have now recovered 47 bodies, 48 other passengers are so far unaccounted for. Sixty-eight people have been hospitalized, while 16 escaped unhurt, including the entire cockpit crew. As for the cause of the accident the World's Odlon Cussin says few details are known at this time. What we know so far is that the flight never really took off. It apparently took off and then crashed immediately afterwards and burst into flames shortly thereafter. There are conflicting reports, but apparently the plane broke into many pieces, 2 or 3 pieces, and some of the passengers were able to escape. There was apparently a lot of rain, may be you can tell us about the weather in the area right now. I know that the region is very used to monsoon season, very rough flying weather. I would assume that planes take off in that kind of rough weather all the time. Was there anything different about this takeoff? Well, Taiwan is in the middle of one of the biggest typhoons of this year. The front edge of this typhoon had just hit Taipei. It's very much like a large hurricane, so as the eye of the hurricane passes over Taiwan, the edge of the hurricane is passing over the airport. The winds are extremely high, upwards of a 100 or 150 kilometers, so nearly a 100 miles an hour, and obviously flying in those conditions can be extremely dangerously. However, the airports in this area are accustomed to flying or to operating in typhoons and they have very exacting standards and the spokesmen at the airport did say that the winds, in this case, were far below the limit that's considered acceptable. And are we hearing anything from the crew at this point? Although all of the crew appeared to have survived, the only comment from any of the crew seems to be that they apparently hit something on take off. There has been no other comment from the crew. How about from other survivors? The survivors have a lot of terrifying tales. One man speaks of trying to pull a man out from under the severed tail section of the plane. Others describe seeing fellow passengers burnt when the flames consumed the plane. Do we know in terms of who was on the plane, how many Taiwanese citizens, how many Americans did make up the plane overall? According to Civil aviation officials, approximately half of the passengers were Taiwanese, 81 Taiwanese and 75 non-Taiwanese and then I believe there were 3 of unknown origin. We know that officials in the Taiwanese government have made some statements, what are you hearing there? Well, apparently the Taiwanese Premiere and many other high officials have come out to the airport and have given a press conference where they said although they don't know how many people have died in this accident, that they fear the worst and they fear they could be as many as a 100 deaths. The World's Odlon Cussin. Thank you very much for update, Odlon. Thank you.

we are going to begin this evening with a story that broke while most americans were at work. it was about mid-morning when we learned something had disastrously wrong in taiwan. on a runway in the airport at taipei, specifically, a singapore airline 747 stretch had crashed and was burning with over 170 people on board. we are still learning exactly what happened. the death toll is at at least 68 and still changing. an update on what we do know tonight from nbc news correspondent robert hager. the scene is horrible. huge fuel-fed flames rising into the night sky, choking black smoke billowing from what's left of the plane. wind-swept rain, the front of a fierce typhoon bearing down on taiwan. and the mangled metal of the plane, fuselage broken into big chunks. a taiwan official says at least 68 are dead, 30 more unaccounted for and among the fewer than 100 known survivors, dozens are injured. 47 u.s. citizens believed aboard. but the numbers keep changing. some passengers trapped when theammed because part of the plane was on its side. it started filling with smoke and i was afraid. there was fire. but this passenger is among the lucky, manages to finally find a way out. a wife in the u.s. get a phone call from her distraught husband who is a passenger. he told me when they were taking off, the plane was shaking quite violently and started lifting and then it seemed to take a nose dive and hit like a brick wall. her husband, john die yazz picks up the story. it seemed like the plane was actually splitting open. oh, god. it was very awful. diaz and others tell a terrible scene at the hospital. there was some people that were very, very, very burned. i mean, burned head to foot. and one woman definitely went into cardiac arrest. and i believe she died right there. singapore airlines says the plane's crew reports as it speeds down the runway for takeoff, it hits something. it's not known what. authorities speculate the pilot may have try today avoid taking off at the last moment. the craft twists and skids wildly to one side, finally come to a stop and erupts in flames. so, the key now is to find out what it was, if anything, that the plane struck on that runway. there was one isolated report that airline officials had found a wheel on the runway that didn't belong to this plane that was involved in the accident. but there's no way to tell yet whether that played any role in this. and then another key question will be the weather itself. certainly that driving rain didn't help any with whatever it was that went wrong in this accident. brian? bob, we talked to survivor earlier tonight from first class. any way of knowing whether there were sections of this plane that fared better than others? it seems that most reports say this plane broke in three pieces and at least one of the three pieces was fully involved in the flame and that seems to be where most of the casualties were. we aren't sure yet which section that was. and i think, too, the fact that this did split open made gaping holes where passengers could get out. mm-hmm. some of the emergency exits were blocked, but the holes may have actually helped some survive this accident. bob hager after a long day covering this story. thank you as always for being with us tonight. with a look just how bad the weather conditions were at the moment the singapore airlines 747 crashed, we go to a meteorologist in our weather center for that. jim, good evening to you. good evening, brian. i have to agree with robert here, just by looking at the aftermath pictures and given the tie foon strength of exengexang sharp and seeing how it encompasses taiwan. 125 miles per hour for the gusts. that's comparable to a category two hurricane in our neck of the woods, causing extensive damage, at least to some areas. another view from our friends at noa shows the eye wall encroaching on the south part of the island. the heaviest of the rain has yet to come. but this is doppler radar, true right at the time of the accident, brian. notice the heavy squall bands dick tiff by the -- indicative by the bands here. and if you remember, brian, like when we were younger and we got that first bike, what did we want to do? we wanted to race as fast as we could. what did we do? we went downhill. same thing in the atmosphere. as the air is transferred down the side of the mountain, it increases the velocity. and at the time of the crash, the winds were sustained 40, 45 miles per hour. factor in the visibility with quarter of a mile and that doesn't paint a pretty picture. the future of the typhoon headed off in a north, north easterly fashion, 40, 45 miles per hour. the worst of the tie fon, we'll probably see improving conditions, oh, maybe 10, 12 hours from now. i should note all these times are eastern standard. so, the improving conditions would occur during our wednesday. thank you for that. and we are joined tonight as well by veteran aviation safety spert david stemplar, president of the air travelers association. david, let's take the components of this one by one. first of all, the airlines, singapore air, superb carrier, correct? one of the safest in the world, never had a fatal passenger accident. and this aircraft, of the 747 series, it is the later model, the stretch, the 747-400. newest of the new of their models, updated everything, glass cockpit, all computerized avionics and basically the whole 747 line has had a very good safety records, only about 15 fatal passenger accidents since it went into service in 1969. and of those accidents, about half were pilot errors. so, it is a pretty solid, well-built airplane. so, david, a layperson and i guess even some of the experts would then say, looking at the pictures of the aftermath, the rescue workers getting pelted by horizontal rain, who would have taken off in the middle of a monsoon? doesn't this, by necessity, have to be pilot error? well, two things, brian. number one, we don't know the conditions that we're seeing on the videotapes and the films are actually what were experiencing at the time at the airport. right. we heard it was maybe 37 knots or miles per hour at the time of the accident. so, we have to look at that. but look, brian, we know for any major fatal accident to our k there's usually six thing that is go wrong. but if you have the situation, we had night, we had rain, we had high winds and probably low visibility. so, before that plane even started down the runway, we were four numbers into a six-number game and there were only two more things that had to go wrong for a fatality and it sounds like something did. 37 knot winds on the nose of a 74 taking off, what are its tolerances? is that bad? there is no limitation on the wind down the nose. the only limitations are cross winds, winds coming from the side or winds coming from behind. and 37 knots is about up where it would normally be on a cross-wind component, but not taking off directly on the nose. now, all the things to be fortunate about and, of course, in addition to those who made it out, as we remember tonight those who did not, the fact there are living witnesses to this, both from the plane and in the tower and ground personnel who saw all of this happen, the fact that the black boxes made it through and are in good shape, we will know something no question about it. the fact that the flight crew was available to us, i think will be most helpful. one thing we have to be careful about, mr. diaz, who has been reported on your program and others about the man who got off and called his wife, one thing he did do is he went back to get his bag with the cell phone in it and that's something we recommend and say never do. when you're in an accident, get out of the plane as fast as you can. it's a bizarre freak of human nature. people want to bring with them a carry-on bag. it becomes the most important thing in their lives, even when the grame is to get down that slide and save your life. absolutely. it's a natural human response because you're always worried about leaving your bag someplace. and people aren't obviously prepared for the accident. but you have to let that go. david, the pictures -- the videotape that we're receiving keeps changing. some of these daytime pictures are the first we're seeing. the bizarre picture of the engine alone in a field and you know how large the 747 engines are. four humans can stand up straight inside one of them. it is an awful scene. we don't know anything about what the object was that this hit. what if it turns out to be some factor of this runway congestion as a trend that we keep reporting on? well, it's number of things. first of all, runway incur intelligence where an airplane hits another object, it's a big, big problem. we just recently had the concorde accident where they ran over a metal part on the runway, the tire burst and brought down the whole airplane. it's quite an issue that we have to be concerned about. what's most haunting as we see these pictures of the plane, i can't shake that feeling that night when twa 800 went down and we watched those burning wreckages. it brings back memories. it does, indeed. well, thanks for coming on. good to be with you.

Hello again, I'm David Chadwick. Thanks for joining us. A Singapore Airlines plane bound for Los Angeles crashed and burst into flames at the main airport in Taipei, Taiwan Tuesday killing at least 68 people. There were 179 passengers and crew on board the Boeing 747, as it attempted to leave Jang Kai Shek International Airport. Authorities say 72 people were injured, 15 are still not accounted for. 24 people walked away from the fiery crash. NBC's Robert Hager reports the pilot reported hitting something on the runway as the big jet was taking off in bad weather. The scene is horrible. Huge fuel-fed flames rising into the night sky, choking black smoke billowing from what's left of the plane, wind-swept rain, in front of a fierce typhoon bearing down on Taiwan, and the mangled metal of the plane, fuselage broken into big chunks. A Taiwan official says at least 66 are dead, 30 more unaccounted for, and among fewer than a 100 known survivors, dozens are injured. 47 US citizens believed aboard, but the numbers keep changing. Some passengers trapped when the emergency exits jammed because part of the plane was on its side. I started feeling the smoke and I was afraid that we would be getting a fire and alive. But this passenger is among the lucky, manages to finally find a way out. A wife in the US gets a phone call from her distraught husband who was a passenger. He told me when they were taking off that the plane was shaking quite violently and started lifting and then it seemed to take a nosedive and hit like a brick wall. Her husband, John Diaz, picks up the story. It seemed like the plane was actually splitting open. Oh God, it was very awful. Diaz and others tell of terrible scenes at the hospital. And there were some people that were very, very, very burnt, I mean burnt head to foot and one woman definitely went into cardiac arrest, and I believe she died right there. Singapore Airlines says the plane's crew reports as it speeds down the runway for take off, it hits something, it's not known what. Authorities speculate the pilot may have tried to avoid taking off at the last moment. The craft twists and skids wildly to one side, finally comes to a stop and erupts in flame. Key now to find out what if anything the plane struck setting off this chain of events. One report says investigators have found a wheel on the runway, that did not belong to the stricken plane, but it's not known if that played a role. And finally, did the typhoon-driven weather make things worse and contribute to this tragic accident. Robert Hager, NBC News, Washington.

Egypt says runoff elections will be needed for most of the 134 seats contested in last Sunday's second round of parliamentary voting. Dave Gavlak reports the opposition is not happy at the idea of having to re-fight so many seats. Fire bombing and rioting by opposition forces greeted the news of the results of Egypt's secondary round of parliamentary elections. Security officials reported that an independent candidate and 25 supporters have been arrested for throwing molitoff cocktails at a vote counting tent in Shakia province, North East of Cairo. Supporters of another independent in the Nile Delta city of Mansura, attacked homes and threw stones at a police station and a clinic. Officials said police arrested 40 people after the incidents. Meanwhile, security forces also arrested 36 supporters of the outlawed Muslim Brotherhood after election-related violence erupted in two Nile Delta towns of Abulkabir and Sandup. Officials said the crowd burnt tires and threw stones. The officials also charged that some Muslim Brotherhood supporters tried to snatch ballot boxes from judges supervising the elections. Police said they responded by using water cannons and tear gas. Election officials say Egypt's ruling National Democratic Party and independents each won nine parliamentary seats outright. The Interior Ministry said that the remaining 116 places will be decided in runoff polls on Saturday between the top two finishers for each seat. The second round of voting took place in nine Governorates or administrative districts in the country. Egypt is carrying out a three phase elections because of a recent decision to have judges monitor polling stations in a bid to avoid vote rigging. The country does not have enough judicial representatives to hold the one-day election. None of the 27 nominally independent candidates back by the banned Muslim Brotherhood won seats in the second phase of voting so far. The Egyptian government has carried out a vigorous crack down on the Islamist group, which says it takes peaceful means to bring about an Islamic government. President Hosni Mubarak's ruling party now controls at least 127 of the 444 parliamentary seats. The Muslim Brotherhood has won six, Legal opposition parties control four and other independent candidates have cornered 29. But these numbers are subject to change as some independent winners pledged their loyalty to President Mubarak's party. The Brotherhood has been two candidates in the three stages of voting. The group has accused the government of harassing and intimidating its candidates and supporters. The final stage of voting is scheduled for November 8 and includes the capital Cairo. The new legislature is expected to convene in mid December. Dale Gavlack for VOA News, Cairo.

Tens of thousands of Spaniards marched through downtown Madrid on Tuesday to shout their frustration over Basque separatist bombings and shootings blamed for 19 killings this year. Many of the estimated 250,000 marchers demanded stiff punishment for the Basque separatist group ETA, which was blamed for a car bombing in Madrid on Monday that killed a Supreme Court judge, his driver and bodyguard, and injured 35 others. ``Life in prison,'' they chanted. Others called for an immediate crackdown to stop the violence. ``The government has to make penalties harsher,'' said Sonia Rull, a 33-year-old secretary. ``Everything can't remain the same after 800 deaths.'' ETA has claimed some 800 killings in its 32-year war for independence in the Basque region that straddles the border between Spain and France. Earlier Tuesday, Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar and other Spanish leaders joined mourning relatives of two of the dead _ slain judge Francisco Querol and his chauffeur, Armando Medina _ for a funeral Mass in one of the court's chambers. The funeral for the third victim of Monday's blast, the judge's police bodyguard, Jesus Escudero Garcia, was held Tuesday in the southern city of Granada. Twelve of those injured remained in Madrid hospitals Tuesday. One, a city bus driver, was in serious condition. The bomb blew the judge's car over a bus and onto a sidewalk, setting vehicles ablaze and smashing windows in about 500 apartments and shops. All political parties condemned the attack except the Basque independence group linked to ETA. The group said the bomb showed that negotiations must take place to resolve the region's conflict. Monday's attack was the deadliest attributed to ETA since the organization ended a 14-month unilateral cease-fire last December. It is now blamed for 19 killings in 10 months, six in October alone. Aznar, who survived an ETA assassination attempt in 1995, urged Spaniards not to despair over the continuing violence. On Monday, he repeated his refusal to engage in talks and pledged to fight ETA through police measures. ``It is clear that no one will achieve any kind of objective through the force of violence, and that no one will make Spaniards yield to threats of guns, whoever may be holding them,'' he said.

A fall in Delaware, a plane crash in Missouri and a modest resurgence in Virginia are injecting late suspense into the battle for control of the Senate, where Democrats are nursing fragile hopes of a takeover. Republicans dismiss such talk, and say they may yet top off Election Night by defeating first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton in New York and the Democrats' $50 million man, Jon Corzine, in New Jersey. With one week remaining until the election, as many as a dozen seats remain competitive out of 34 on the ballot, according to strategists in both parties, enough to swing control either way. ``We are increasingly encouraged by the competitiveness of so many of the races,'' Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle said in a recent interview. ``We think if the election were held today, there is at least a 50-50 chance of taking back the Senate,'' said the South Dakotan who would become majority leader if the Democrats gain a majority. ``The two keys for us are Nevada and Virginia,'' said Stuart Roy, spokesman for the GOP senatorial campaign committee. ``If we win those two states, it will slam the door shut on the Democrats' opportunity to take control of the Senate,'' he said, adding that they are ``two states where Democrats hold the seats and we hold the lead.'' Republicans hold a 54-46 edge in the current Senate, and will be defending 19 of the 35 seats on the ballot next Tuesday. The election arithmetic is so complicated that it's possible the Senate's makeup won't be known until well after Nov. 7. Sen. Joseph Lieberman, Al Gore's vice presidential running mate, is coasting to a new term from Connecticut. But he would give up his Senate seat if Democrats win the presidential race, giving Gov. John Rowland, a Republican, the chance to appoint a replacement. And a seven-way race in Georgia holds out the possibility of a run-off in December. Sen. Zell Miller, a Democrat, leads Republican Mack Mattingly in a race to complete the unexpired term of the late Sen. Paul Coverdell. Republicans are hoping to hold Miller below a majority, triggering a run-off in late November. A few seats have become more predictable in recent weeks. GOP Sen. Rod Grams, elected in the Republican landslide in 1994, remains behind in the polls in his bid for a second term in Minnesota, and many strategists in his party concede Democrat Mark Dayton is poised to defeat him. Democrats acknowledge they are likely to lose a seat in Nevada, where former GOP Rep. John Ensign is running. And in Rhode Island and Pennsylvania, where Democratic strategists had once hoped to mount strong challenges, GOP Sens. Lincoln Chafee and Rick Santorum appear comfortably ahead. In Florida, Democrat Bill Nelson has been ahead consistently in the polls against GOP Rep. Bill McCollum for a GOP-held open seat, although Republicans claim late momentum. Elsewhere, tight and sometimes volatile races are the norm, Virginia, Delaware and Missouri contests among them. In Virginia, former GOP Gov. George Allen has long led in the polls in his effort to deny Sen. Charles Robb a third term. But a Washington Post survey last week suggested Robb was closing the gap, President Clinton made a weekend foray into Northern Virginia on his behalf and Republicans concede the race has tightened. Democrats say this race is particularly important to their national prospects. Without a Robb victory, says Sen. Robert Torricelli of New Jersey, chairman of the Democratic campaign committee, it will be very difficult if not impossible for his party to win a Senate majority. In Delaware, Republican Sen. William V. Roth, the chairman of the tax-writing Sen. Finance Committee, had been locked in a tight race for months with Democratic Gov. Tom Carper. However, two weeks ago, the 79-year-old Roth's eyes rolled up as he fell backward and struck his head against a wall _ an image captured by video cameras. It was the second time in three weeks that Roth had fallen in public incidents that aides attribute to vertigo. He was checked by physicians and resumed his campaigning and his Senate duties. Republicans privately express concern, though, that he has lost support in the days since. In Missouri, Republican Sen. John Ashcroft was battling Democratic Gov. Mel Carnahan in a tight, costly battle when the governor was killed in a light plane crash two weeks ago. Under state law, it was too late to remove Carnahan's name from the ballot. And on Monday, the governor's widow, Jean Carnahan, said she would accept Gov. Roger Wilson's offer of a Senate appointment if her husband wins the election posthumously. ``I've decided to ... continue the fight for his ideals,'' she said. Ashcroft suspended campaigning when the governor perished, and told reporters that if it ``ends up costing me the election, I still believe it was the right thing to do.'' Polling suggests that the race, which was virtually even when the governor was alive, has tilted toward Carnahan since his death. Both parties are struggling to craft tasteful, yet effective strategies for the campaign's final days. In several other races, incumbent Republicans are struggling. In Michigan, Sen. Spencer Abraham opened up a double-digit lead in some polls earlier in the fall, but surveys since then have shown Democratic Rep. Debbie Stabenow closing the gap. Sen. Slade Gorton in Washington is trying to hold off a challenge from Maria Cantwell, a former House member turned Internet millionaire. Sen. Conrad Burns is bidding for a third term in Montana against Democrat Brian Schweitzer, a political novice, in an especially tight race. Nevada aside, Democrats are laboring to hold onto open seats in New York, where recent polls suggest Rep. Rick Lazio has momentum in his race against Mrs. Clinton; and in New Jersey, where Democrat Jon Corzine has been unable to pull comfortably away from Rep. Bob Franks despite spending more than $50 million of his own funds. In Nebraska, where former Gov. Ben Nelson, a Democrat, is making his second try for the Senate, Democrats and Republicans alike say he is likely to succeed this time, replacing departing Democratic Sen. Bob Kerrey.

A Singapore Airlines 747 jetliner taking off for Los Angeles hit an object on the runway during a storm Tuesday night, scattering flaming wreckage across the tarmac. At least 65 people were killed, a Taiwanese official said. Taiwanese aviation official Billy K.C. Chang said that in addition to those who died, 84 people were injured and 30 were unaccounted for. The aborted takeoff occurred at 11:18 p.m. Minutes later, ambulances and rescue vehicles crowded the wet tarmac, lights flashing. Local TV reports showed a frantic scene at Chang Gung Memorial Hospital near the airport, where emergency room workers gently lifted injured people from ambulances. Some appeared to be burned. They laid on stretchers with their arms stretched stiffly in front of their torsos. Tonya Joy, 37, of New Zealand, was being pushed toward the operating room. ``I felt two hits and we twisted around twice,'' she said. ``I jumped out of the top and landed on the ground, so the doctors think there is something wrong with my spine. The weather was just awful. Flames came so fast on both sides of the plane.'' About a half-dozen relatives arrived Tuesday at the Los Angeles airport. They were escorted to a private room with counselors from the Red Cross to await news on the passengers, said B.V. Castillo, a Red Cross spokeswoman. In Singapore, officials set up a crisis management center at Changi airport. A handful of relatives, some in tears, were led to the cordoned-off area by crisis workers. Singapore Airlines, the South Asian city-state's flagship carrier, is one of the world's most profitable airlines. It has been flying for 28 years and had never crashed. The plane that burst into flames Tuesday was bought new in January 1997, Boyd said. He said there had been no problems with the aircraft, which underwent its last maintenance check on Sept. 16. On Dec. 19, 1997, a SilkAir Boeing 737 was cruising over Indonesia at 35,000 feet when the jet suddenly nosed down, diving at supersonic speeds until it smashed into a river, killing all 104 people aboard. Singapore Airlines is the parent company of SilkAir. The storm pounding Taiwan, Typhoon Xangsane, had whirled closer to the island's southern coast on Tuesday and heavy rains have already begun soaking the capital, Taipei. The typhoon was packing 90 mph winds and was expected to make landfall by Wednesday if it maintained its current course, the Central Weather Bureau said. Earlier in the evening, the storm had prompted officials to set up disaster relief centers, cancel some flights, call off classes and raise land and sea warnings. Typhoon relief and coordinating centers were set up all over southern Taiwan, and officials warned residents against landslides and flash floods. The incident comes a year to the day after EgyptAir Flight 990 plunged into the Atlantic Ocean while en route from New York to Cairo. That disaster killed 217 people. ___ On the Net: http://www.singaporeair.com

A Singapore Airlines jumbo jet speeding down a runway in darkness and rain slammed into an object before takeoff for Los Angeles and burst into flames Tuesday, scattering fiery wreckage across the tarmac, witnesses said. Seventy-seven people were killed and dozens more were injured, a Taiwanese official said. It wasn't immediately clear what Flight SQ006 hit, but the collision wreaked havoc on the plane: Video footage showed the Boeing 747-400 spewing flames and thick black smoke despite the heavy rain. Afterward, parts of the blue-and-white fuselage were badly charred, with a gaping hole in the roof of the forward section. The pilot ``saw an object on the runway and he tried to take off to avoid the object, and he hit the object,'' airline spokesman Rick Clements said in Singapore. There were 20 crew members and 159 passengers on board. Clements said 47 U.S. citizens and 55 Taiwanese were among the passengers. Taiwanese civil aviation official Billy K.C. Chang declined to comment on the cause of the crash until investigators retrieved the plane's ``black boxes,'' the flight data and voice cockpit recorders. ``It felt like we bumped into something huge,'' said Doug Villermin, 33, of New Iberia, La., who was standing outside the Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, wrapped in a hospital gown and smoking a cigarette. ``It looked like the front end just fell off. From there, it just started to fall apart. I ran to the escape hatch with the stewardess but we couldn't get it open. Two feet away from me, I saw flames. ``Everyone was just panicking,'' he said. ``I tried to open the escape hatch on the top just a slit and saw a lot of smoke. The fumes were just incredible. But eventually we got it open. ... We were just all so scared it was going to blow up.'' It was Singapore Airlines' first major accident in 28 years of operation, and it came in nasty weather: A typhoon packing 90 mph winds was whirling off Taiwan's southern coast Tuesday, lashing the island with rain and prompting officials to set up disaster relief centers. Chang said 77 people died, 54 were hospitalized and 48 suffered minor or no injuries. Earlier, Singapore Airlines Chairman Michael Fam said 66 people were killed. Speaking in Singapore, Fam said the plane ``crashed on the runway during the takeoff.'' ``We wish to express our sincere regret to all concerned,'' he said. ``This is a tragic day for all of us.'' Clements said Singapore Airlines would provide all families of victims with $25,000 immediate compensation. ``We should wait for the investigations, but the early indications are that it (the plane) did momentarily take off,'' he said. Besides the Americans and Taiwanese, airline spokesman James Boyd in Los Angeles said there also were 11 Singaporeans on board, 11 Indians, eight Malaysians, five Indonesians, four Mexicans, four British, two each from Thailand, New Zealand and Vietnam and one each from Australia, Canada, Cambodia, Germany, Japan, Philippines, Ireland and the Canary Islands/Spain. Villermin and two other survivors said they felt the plane slam into something on the runway while trying to take off at Taipei's Chiang Kai-shek International Airport. Airline officials said the pilot, Capt. C.K. Foong, also reported hitting an object, but no one offered an explanation of what it might have been. A China Airways official denied initial reports that the jumbo jet had hit one of its planes on the ground. ``The left wing seemed to hit something and then it was just a big roller-coaster ride,'' said survivor Steven Courtney of Britain, oxygen tubes in his nose as he was whisked away to an operating room at a nearby hospital. ``Flames were everywhere.'' The aborted takeoff occurred at 11:18 p.m. Minutes later, ambulances and rescue vehicles crowded the wet tarmac, lights flashing. The scene was frantic at Chang Gung hospital near the airport, where emergency room workers gently lifted injured people from ambulances. Some appeared to be burned. They laid on stretchers with their arms stretched stiffly in front of their torsos. Tonya Joy, 37, of New Zealand, was being pushed toward the operating room. ``I felt two hits and we twisted around twice,'' she said. ``I jumped out of the top and landed on the ground, so the doctors think there is something wrong with my spine. The weather was just awful. Flames came so fast on both sides of the plane.'' In Taipei, civil aviation official Chang and Singapore Airlines spokesman Mark Tsai declined to comment on whether the plane hit something or left the ground before it caught fire. They both said that they would not comment on the blaze as officials tried to determine the conditions and cause of the accident. About a half-dozen relatives arrived Tuesday at the Los Angeles airport. They were escorted to a private room with counselors from the Red Cross to await news on the passengers, said B.V. Castillo, a Red Cross spokeswoman. In Singapore, officials set up a crisis management center at Changi airport. A handful of relatives, some in tears, were led to the cordoned-off area by crisis workers. In Washington, the National Transportation Safety Board said it was sending a team of investigators to help Taiwan authorities probe the disaster. The eight-member NTSB team was expected to arrive in Taiwan on Thursday evening. Singapore Airlines, the South Asian city-state's flagship carrier, is one of the world's most profitable airlines and has one of the industry's best safety records. The national carrier enjoys a young fleet of modern aircraft. It flies to more than 40 countries and, with its traditionally dressed stewardesses and free amenities, is consistently voted the most favored airline of business travelers. The plane that burst into flames Tuesday was bought new in January 1997, Boyd said. He said there had been no problems with the aircraft, which underwent its last maintenance check on Sept. 16. Clements said Foong, the Malaysian captain, joined the airline in 1979 and had 11,235 flight hours. On Dec. 19, 1997, a SilkAir Boeing 737 was cruising over Indonesia at 35,000 feet when the jet suddenly nosed down, diving at supersonic speeds until it smashed into a river, killing all 104 people aboard. Singapore Airlines is the parent company of SilkAir. Tuesday's incident shares some traits with the Air France Concorde disaster that killed 113 people outside Paris in July: Investigators believe the chain of events that brought the Concorde down began when the plane hit a strip of metal on the runway, bursting a tire. The latest disaster also comes a year to the day after EgyptAir Flight 990 plunged into the Atlantic Ocean while en route from New York to Cairo. That crash killed 217 people. ___ On the Net: http://www.singaporeair.com

The run-down building was once the town's movie house, showing Western and Arab films to audiences coming from nearby villages in the former Marxist republic of South Yemen. Several years ago, a towering minaret was added and Quranic verses were painted on its whitewashed facade. Ja'ar's movie house is now a mosque where Muslim radicals preach sermons calling for establishing an Islamic state. For years Ja'ar, 50 miles northeast of Aden, has been a stronghold of Yemen's most militant Islamic groups _ groups under a spotlight following the Oct. 12 attack on the USS Cole as it sat in Aden's port. The Cole bombing killed 17 servicemen and wounded 35 others. Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh has confirmed that some members of the group Islamic Jihad have been detained for questioning in connection with the assault on Cole. While radical groups have been forced to abandon their military camps in the rugged mountains surrounding Ja'ar, their members are still active in Ja'ar, delivering speeches and sermons peppered with anti-American rhetoric. ``They have only changed their skin and their tactics, but they do not seem to be less motivated than ever to pursue their goals,'' said Hussein Saeed Saleh, head of the town's branch of the Socialist Party, which ruled South Yemen before the 1990 merger with North Yemen. When it was an independent state, South Yemen prided itself as the only secular country amid traditional societies on the Arabian Peninsula. Today, alcohol is prohibited in Ja'ar, a dusty town with one main street and clusters of brick buildings about 10 miles from coast. Schools were forced to adopt a fundamentalist curriculum and women are banned from leaving their houses without draping themselves head-to-toe in black robes. Violators of the strict rules are subject to severe punishment, including public lashing. The Aden-Abyan Islamic Army, which many believe remains capable of planning and mounting terrorist attacks, once had a base in the mountains above Ja'ar. The group is believed to have been set up by Yemenis and other Arabs who fought in Afghanistan against the Soviets in the 1980s and later returned to their countries to wage a jihad, or holy war, against their own governments. In 1994, the Aden-Abyan Islamic Army under Zein al-Abidine al-Mihdar fought alongside the northern forces in the civil war that ended the secessionist regime in the south. As a reward, President Saleh allowed them to function freely, even open military training facilities. He appointed some Islamic extremists to military and government jobs. The Aden-Abyan Islamic Army imposed its version of Islamic law in southern Yemen, closing down cinemas, bars and nightclubs. They even burned down a government-owned beer factory. When the government tried to rein them in they proclaimed the state anti-Islamic and began attacking security positions and oil pipelines and kidnapping foreign tourists. Sources close to the group said al-Mihdar also began building closer relations with Osama bin Laden, whom he knew from Afghanistan. Al-Mihdar applauded as ``a heroic operation'' the 1998 bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania that killed 224 people. Washington blames bin Laden for the bombings. In a statement after the bombings, al-Mihdar called on all Yemenis to ``kill the Americans and take their belongings and to destroy their facilities and bases which are under preparation in Aden, Hodeidah and Socotra.'' Militants' activities in Yemen were no secret, not even to the U.S. government, which has called Yemen a haven for terrorists. Now many in the United States are asking why the Cole and other U.S. ships would risk a visit to southern Yemen to refuel. Four months after the attacks on U.S. embassies in Africa, the Aden-Abyan Army kidnapped 16 foreign tourists. Government soldiers stormed the hide-out near Ja'ar and four of the hostages died in the rescue attempt. Al-Mihdar was captured and later convicted in the hostages' deaths and executed. The raid netted explosives, timing devices and a list of targets including the Royal Hotel in Aden, home to American soldiers helping the Yemeni army clear mines. And the army found with al-Mihdar many non-Yemeni Arabs, mostly Egyptian and Algerian Afghan war veterans, among them a member of Egypt's Islamic Group who was identified as a close assistant to the group's leader Ayman al-Zawahri, a senior leader of bin Laden's Al-Qaida terrorist network. Abu Hamza el-Misri, who heads the Supporters of al-Sharia, a London-based militant group, which had links with al-Mihdar, said the Aden army would have sought revenge for the death of their leader. The first anniversary of al-Mihdar's execution was just a few days after the Cole attack. ``For them it was only a matter of timing and choosing the best target,'' el-Misri said in a telephone interview. ``They might be hit, they might be curtailed and their resources might be dried up, but they are destined to come back.''

KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ U.S. and North Korean officials on Wednesday resumed talks that Washington hopes will curb the communist country's missile program and improve global security. The talks, which follow an encouraging meeting last week between U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and North Korean leader Kim Jong Il, may influence whether President Clinton makes a historic trip to North Korea. ``The talks this week will build on discussions between Albright and Chairman Kim,'' Robert Einhorn, assistant secretary of state and head of the U.S. delegation. At last week's talks, ``serious progress was made, including missile issues,'' he said. Negotiators were working on proposals that North Korea suspend its missile program and allow other countries to launch its satellites into space. Also under the proposals, discussed last month at talks in New York, North Korea would curb its missile program in exchange for promises of U.S. help for its devastated economy. North Korean negotiator Jang Chang Chon, head of his country's bureau on U.S. affairs, said before talks began at the U.S. Embassy in Kuala Lumpur that the round of negotiations could beyond its scheduled Friday end. ``We'll discuss all issues, including our suspension of missile exports and the U.S. launch of our satellites during the missile talks,'' Jang was quoted as saying by the South Korean news agency, Yonhap. Jung Sung Il, secretary general of the North Korean Foreign Ministry, told reporters after Wednesday's talks wrapped up that ``the meeting was held in a good atmosphere, with serious discussion.'' ``Maybe we can have results, but for now it is uncertain because the meeting is still going on,'' Jung said. Einhorn said that the discussions would focus on ``North Korea's indigenous missile program and missile-related exports and Chairman Kim's idea of exchanging serious North Korea missile restraints for launches of North Korean satellites.'' North Korea has said it needs missiles to launch scientific satellites, and it regards its missile program as part of its right to self-defense. Einhorn and Jang were in Kuala Lumpur in July, but the talks deadlocked when the Pyongyang team demanded $1 billion in compensation to curb its profitable missile exports _ something the United States has so far refused. U.S. officials say the long-reclusive, impoverished country stands to gain far more politically and economically from a better security environment and normalized relations with Washington. The United States claims North Korea is the world's top exporter of missile equipment and technology to customers including Pakistan and Iran. After rattling Asia in mid-1998 by test firing a missile over Japan into the Pacific Ocean, North Korea recently agreed to a moratorium on long-range missile tests in exchange for an easing of U.S. sanctions. The North has dramatically improved relations with its longtime enemies since its leader met with South Korean President Kim Dae-jung in a June summit. In a new sign of the warming ties, North and South Korea cooperated in drawing up a resolution at the United Nations' General Assembly applauding the summit and supporting reunification of the Korean peninsula. The resolution was presented and adopted Tuesday.

The Cole has been loaded onto the deck of the Blue Marlin, a ship owned by Steenbuch's company, Offshore Heavy Transport. The trip home is expected to take about five weeks.

WASHINGTON (AP) _ U.S. intelligence agencies have picked up ``credible threat information'' against American targets in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, and all U.S. forces in those Persian Gulf countries were placed on the highest state of alert, officials said. The heightened alert coincided with confirmation Tuesday that since the bombing of the USS Cole in Yemen on Oct. 12, no American warship has used the Suez Canal. The 101-mile-long waterway provides the fastest, and the normally followed, passage from the eastern United States to the gulf, where a U.S. aircraft carrier and its support ships maintain a permanent presence. Some officials said U.S. military commanders believe it is prudent to avoid the Suez Canal for security reasons, but Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon said no official decision was made to stop using the canal, which links the Mediterranean and Red seas. Egyptian authorities have increased security at the Suez Canal since the Cole bombing, a senior official at the strategic waterway said Wednesday. He refused to divulge details, but other sources who live near the canal said a road running parallel to the waterway has been closed to civilian traffic. A U.S. intelligence official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Wednesday that the targets of the terrorist threats related to Saudi Arabia and Kuwait were not specific, even as to whether the targets were military or civilian. They were credible enough, though, to take extra precautions, he said. The crippled Cole, with a 40-foot-by-40-foot hole in the left side of its steel hull _ has been lifted onto the deck of a specialized transport ship, the Blue Marlin, which will carry the destroyer back to the United States. The Navy said Wednesday the Blue Marlin, with the Cole aboard, had begun its voyage. The Navy would not say which route the Blue Marlin will take, but defense officials speaking on condition of anonymity had said earlier this week that it probably would take the long way home by going around the Cape of Good Hope on Africa's southern tip, to avoid the Suez Canal. The more than 200 members of the Cole crew who had remained on the ship after the bombing will be flown back to their home base, Norfolk Naval Station in Virginia, probably on Friday, officials said. Despite an appeal by President Clinton for ``a genuine, joint investigation,'' Yemeni government investigators continued to question suspects without the participation of FBI agents sent to the Arabian peninsula country after the explosion. Yemeni officials said transcripts of interrogations were sent to U.S. investigators, who posed questions to Yemenis, then followed up. ABC News reported Tuesday night that U.S. officials suspect Yemeni authorities erased critical parts of a videotape taken by a harbor surveillance camera the day the Cole was hit. FBI spokeswoman Tracey Silberling said she did not know about the tape and could not comment on the report. Pentagon spokesman Bacon said the roughly 5,000 U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia and 5,000 in Kuwait were placed Monday on the highest alert level, ``threat condition delta.'' ``It is due to credible threat information involving unspecified targets,'' he said. Last week the Pentagon said American forces in Bahrain and Qatar, tiny Gulf states with friendly relations with the United States, were placed on ``threat condition delta'' in response to terrorist threats of unknown credibility against specific targets _ including an airfield in Bahrain used by American aircraft. At Arlington National Cemetery, one of the last of the slain sailors brought home from the Cole was buried Tuesday. Hull Maintenance Technician 3rd Class Kenneth E. Clodfelter, 21, of Mechanicsville, Va., was among the 17 victims. ``Kenneth won't be forgotten; the other 16 won't be forgotten; the Cole won't be forgotten,'' Clodfelter's father, John, said after the funeral. At a Pentagon briefing, Bacon displayed U.S. Navy photographs of the Cole being maneuvered onto the deck of the Blue Marlin, but none showed the Cole raised out of the water to show the full dimensions of the bomb crater in its hull. Bacon said such photos might not be made public. He said the only U.S. ship that had been scheduled to transit the Suez Canal since the Cole did so on Oct. 9 was the destroyer USS Donald Cook, which instead will accompany the Cole on its voyage home. He said it would be a matter of weeks before any other ships are scheduled to use the canal, but he denied that reflected a change in plans. In the meantime, U.S. officials are consulting with the Egyptian government, which owns and operates the Suez Canal, on security arrangements, Bacon said. Although the Persian Gulf region generally is considered more dangerous than many other parts of the world, security worries have escalated since the Cole bombing. American officials believe the attack was the work of terrorists, possibly with links to suspected terrorism mastermind Osama bin Laden. Along with a Navy carrier battle group in the Gulf, the troops in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait form the bulk of the U.S. effort to contain Iraq's military. They include a U.S. Air Force contingent at Prince Sultan Air Base in central Saudi Arabia that helps patrol the ``no fly'' zone over southern Iraq. The American forces in Kuwait are mainly Army units at Camp Doha and include a Patriot air defense missile unit. ___ On the Net: The USS Cole: http://www.chinfo.navy.mil/navpalib/news/news_stories/cole.html The Blue Marlin: http://www.oht.no

the "uss cole" is on its long journey home tonight, sitting atop a rescue ship. and now, for the first time, its open wound fully visible. nbc's jim miklaszewski tonight at the pentagon with an exclusive report on the damage done and the difficulty in finding those responsible. jim? what's the latest there? new pictures reveal the sheer power of that terrorist bomb that ripped through the "uss cole." for the first time, with the "cole" out of the water, the full impact of the catastrophic blast clearly visible. in these photos obtained by nbc news, the damage much larger than first imagined. extending well below the water line. workers on deck dwarfed by the 40 x 60-foot gaping wound. large sections of the hull buckled inward. crewman sean powell, back home in florida, says inside the "cole," it was chaos. it got dark. we lost power. ship started to list. that's what scared everybody. despite the devastating damage, navy officials predict the "cole" can be repaired for about $150 million. and put back into service. justice department officials say in yemen, the fbi's investigation is dead in the water. senior u.s. officials tell nbc news the yemen government has all but shut down all cooperation in finding those behind the "cole" attack. evidence is either withheld or tampered with. a surveillance video of the harbor at the time of the attack was so heavily edited, it didn't even show the blast itself. why? yemen is a terrorist hotbed, and some members of president saleh's own cabinet have direct ties to radical islamic extremists and terrorists. it's hard to see exactly why it is that the president there would ever want to cooperate with the united states and possibly put himself in jeopardy. reporter: and even though cooperation from yemen is at a standstill, u.s. officials tell nbc news that they are making substantial progress in the investigation and are fully confident they will get enough evidence to retaliate against those responsible. tom? thanks very much, nbc's jim miklaszewski tonight.

if you've ever been on an airliner when something unexpected happens -- rough air, a landing or takeoff in terrible weather -- no doubt you've wondered, "if something happens, what will i do?" john diaz of santa monica was thinking just that before and after he boarded singapore airlines flight 006 in taiwan the other night. when it hit something on takeoff, his nightmare came true. tonight, the chilling tale of john diaz, "in his own words." i didn't really think this flight was going to take off. the weather conditions had deteriorated to what i considered were hurricane conditions. and the plane started to lumber and pick up speed down the runway. and there was no visibility. all you could see were these sheets of rain, with the wind blowing them across. i thought -- i felt the wind just slam us back down to the ground, and it was a tremendous jolt. and all of a sudden, flames just burst out everywhere. and globules of liquid fire that would explode and just ignite against things. how i didn't get burned, i have no idea. and i looked into the economy section, and it was horrific. you couldn't really see because it was black smoke, but you could just see writhing fire, and you knew that those were human beings trapped in there. i got out and hit, hit the runway running. i ran, and a group of five or six of us got about 200 feet back. i looked back at that point, and the entire plane was engulfed in flame. i didn't think anybody else survived. i had my cell phone. so i was able to call my wife when i was standing out looking at the plane burn, and i was not scared. as a matter of fact, i wasn't shocked or surprised. the way to look at it is that "unbelievable, you are now a survivor, and this is the first day of your new life." john diaz, "in his own words" tonight.

Investigators interviewed the jet captain and recovered two crucial data-recording boxes from the Los Angeles-bound Singapore Airlines flight that crashed during takeoff late on Tuesday, killing 79. Speculation swirled around the captain's reported statement that he saw an object in his path and was unable to avoid hitting it before the giant Boeing 747 veered off the runway, split apart and was engulfed in flames. One theory is that high winds from an incoming typhoon might have blown a piece of construction equipment from an adjacent runway onto the path of flight SQ006. But inspectors were not ruling out either pilot error or weather factors, and cautioned that it was too early to determine the cause. On Wednesday, officials of the Taiwan government and Singapore Airlines both rejected the charge, made by some angry relatives of crash victims, that it had been irresponsible to try to take off in the whipping typhoon gales Tuesday night, insisting that weather conditions were well within internationally accepted standards. Evidence so far suggests that the accelerating aircraft veered onto a parallel runway before erupting into a fireball, said Chou Kuan-Tsan of Taiwan's Aviation Safety Council at a news conference Wednesday evening. But he declined to speculate about why. ``We still can't rule out any possibilities,'' he said. Chou said that three members of the cockpit crew, including the captain, were interviewed for three hours on Wednesday afternoon and that both the flight-data and voice recorders from the aircraft had been recovered in good condition. Investigators from the American Federal Aviation Administration, Boeing and Pratt and Whitney, the maker of the jet's engines, were en route to join experts from Singapore Airlines and local officials in a task force to seek the cause of the accident. The death toll as of Wednesday night stood at 79, of 159 passengers and 20 crew members who were aboard the flight. The passenger list released by the airline showed 45 Americans on board, with 22 of them confirmed as surviving. The largest number of fatalities were Taiwanese, though citizens of Singapore and numerous other countries were also aboard. It seemed almost a miracle that more than 40 of the passengers and crew members escaped with minor injuries, since the jumbo jet was violently ripped into three parts and its gushing fuel tanks quickly exploded into a withering fireball. Many of those who were least injured were in the rear of the plane, which was spared the worst of the fire. Dozens more people suffered severe burns or injuries and were being treated in nearby hospitals, and officials said the death toll could rise. On Wednesday morning, as rescue workers removed the last of the bodies from the charred aircraft, scores of Taiwanese relatives of victims made the sad journey to a makeshift morgue, set up in an old hanger of Chiang Kai-shek International Airport, to identify remains. Anxious and grieving relatives peered into body bags lying next to empty wooden coffins while Buddhist monks chanted and Catholic and other religious leaders held a vigil. Many of the bodies were badly burned and will have to be identified through DNA analysis, officials said. Singapore Airlines began flying relatives of victims to Taipei and said it would immediately provide each family with $25,000 in emergency aid. The aircraft was manufactured in 1997 and received major maintenance this fall with no signs of any problems, an airline official said. The fierce storm moving into Taipei as the plane began its takeoff Tuesday night led to speculation that sudden wind shifts might have caused the aircraft to founder. But officials noted that another jet had left successfully under seemingly identical conditions only minutes earlier and attention seemed to be shifting toward a collision with some object as a possible cause. The captain, C.K. Foong, is a Malaysian with lengthy experience. He told investigators that he ``saw an object on the runway and he tried to take off to avoid the object, and he hit the object,'' according to Rick Clements, a Singapore Airlines vice president who spoke with reporters in Singapore. Clements said the captain had not been able to identify the object. Television scenes of the crash scene reveal burned heavy equipment including two earth excavators, but these may have been damaged after the jet careered off course and spewed forth its fuel. Because much of the wreckage was found on a runway adjacent to the approved takeoff route, which was under repair, some speculated that the pilot may have taken the wrong path in the poor visibility of the storm. Aviation Safety Council officials said, though, that voice recordings show that the pilot correctly repeated the tower's instruction about which runway to use. Another government aviation investigator, Chou Hsien-tsan, said officials were examining the two damaged earth excavators to reconstruct whether and where they were directly struck. ``We are just gathering information, and have had no time to analyze it,'' Chou told reporters. The typhoon hit northern Taiwan with full force on Wednesday morning, keeping the Taipei airport closed until mid-afternoon and causing major flooding and at least 50 deaths from drowning or mudslides.

we have for you now the latest tonight on the crash of that singapore airline 747 in taipei, taiwan. the death toll is now up to 79. and of the survivors, 39 are still hospitalized. 47 of all the passengers as you may know were americans. in a moment we're going to have stories of some of those survivors who managed incredibly somehow to walk away from that burning wreckage. first we get the latest on the investigation tonight into just what happened on that runway in taiwan as a 747 was beginning its initial rollout in near typhoon conditions. our report tonight from nbc news chief aviation correspondent robert hager. as daylight brings the first shocking look and all that's left of the plane, the death toll climbs to at least 79 and may go higher still. 23 of the dead are americans. the plane's black box recorders have now been found, and u.s. investigators are en route to taiwan to help. as for survivors -- we saw flashes of a fire when the plane broke apart. flames came into the cabin, smoke. it was everywhere. many seated near the rear escaped through the huge gap left when it breaks away. what causes this tragedy? the pilot who survives says he was taxiing down the runway for takeoff when suddenly he saw something in front of the plane on the runway, tried to jerk the nose up to miss it, but it was too late. instead he hit it and careened to one side. but so far, investigators can't say what it was he hit. they're looking at heavy equipment working on a parallel runway but don't know it was involved. they even wonder if the plane was taxiing on the wrong runway. the airline says there's no evidence of that. and what about wether? the approaching typhoon? in california, steve chon who lost his mother, aupt, and an uncle is angry. i don't know why the pilot took off in that stormy weather with 80 miles an hour winds. i don't believe that was the right thing to do. in fact, airport officials say the wind was 35 miles an hour, gusting into the 50's. visibility about 1/3 of a mile, within the safe range. but what if there was an obstacle on the runway? at takeoff speeds, the airplane is traveling probably 200 feet every second or more. that would only give the pilots maybe six or seven seconds to see something he's approaching out in front of him and react to it. that may not have been enough time in this case. questions tonight as investigators push to find out why this happened. robert hager, nbc news, washington. now to the question tonight of why some walked out of the wreckage and fire and others did not. the answer appears to be random. fate, in fact, was decided at least by one survivor as the reason. with more tonight on the stories of those who made it out of that 747 alive, nbc news correspondent ned colt with us tonight from taipei, taiwan. &GT;&GT; it's thursday morning here in taiwan. and there are a number of relatives who have been arriving from the united states. there are going to be more arriving this afternoon. they have been heading out to the airport where there's a room that's been set up to help with the family members and try to determine exactly who is who. there's a big problem clearly because many of those who were in the middle of the aircraft as bob hager was describing were burned beyond recognition. they're providing d.n.a. samples. d.n.a. sampleling have been completed on the victims of the aircraft. there has been this temporary morgue set up out aft the airport. dozens of coffins lined up with the remains under shrouds. in front of them, a police guard standing over each one of those coffins. now, most of the 23 of 47 american who is survived this have been released. the ones who can, many are still suffering from burns in the hospital, but about a dozen have been released. one of them is 43-year-old jamal, who we spoke with just a while ago. he is a sirian american who was on his way home for a halloween party and clearly didn't make it as a result of this tragedy. last night he was meeting with friends here. he says he survived because, like many of those who did, he was sitting in the back of the aircraft. he was right next to the rear bulkhead when the plane broke up. it was like earthquake, exactly like earthquake. boom, boom, boom, boom. well, you know, i start to say oh, my god, god. i mean, i don't know what i'm going to do. but i'm trying to stay sitting in the chair, you know? no power. smog come up and at moments we stopped and flame of fire i fell on my face. chaos. everyone shouting, yelling, screaming, crying. the negs thing he knew, the plane was on its side, literally at a 90-degree angle. he was looking up at other passengers. he unbuckled his belt, felt a breeze of fresh air and that's when the passengers made his way out. he ended up around 200 feet from the aircraft in a ditch when the plane was enveloped in planes. he said he can't believe the plane took off. it was being buffeted by winds and rain on the jetway before it took off. many here are looking forward to getting home. he said the most difficult times for him are when he's trying to sleep. that's one of the most obvious difficult times because that's when he thinks about what's happened. it's also when he watches the pictures of the tragedy that took place here. he like many who survived are looking forward to getting home and meeting with their relatives. ned colt tonight from taipei, taiwan. thank you for that.

Families of Singapore Airlines crash victims flew to Taiwan to retrieve their loved ones' bodies Wednesday as officials worked to figure out what caused the plane to burst into flames during takeoff, killing 79 people _ at least 23 of them Americans. Survivors have said they felt Flight SQ006 hit something as the plane barreled down the runway. But as emergency workers pulled bodies from the charred, blue-and-tan wreckage Wednesday, early speculation also pointed to wind as a possible factor in the Boeing 747-400's accident: At the time of takeoff, the airport was being lashed by the swirling gusts and torrential rains of an approaching typhoon. Some relatives of those who died have blamed the pilot, Capt. C.K. Foong. On Wednesday, one woman pounded the counter at a Singapore Airlines ticket counter in Taipei and shouted at the company's employees, ``How could you take off in this weather?'' But the airline _ which had not had a major accident in 28 years of operation _ defended Foong's decision. ``Conditions were well within safe operational limits,'' company spokesman Rick Clements told reporters in Singapore. He noted that a flight by Taiwan's China Airlines took off just 15 minutes before Singapore Airlines' takeoff. Taiwanese aviation official Billy K.C. Chang said Tuesday night's visibility levels of 1,650-1,980 feet at Chiang Kai-shek International Airport exceeded the minimum requirement of 660 feet needed for takeoff. Measuring safe wind speeds is more complicated, but the gusty winds were not excessive, he said. In general, control towers in Taiwan monitor wind speed and direction, visibility, air traffic and other factors before authorizing takeoffs, especially during storms such as typhoons. It is then up to the pilot to decide whether to go ahead with the takeoff or to abort it if unexpected problems develop on the runway. As investigators probed and victims' loved ones hurled accusations amid their tears, medical workers tried to identify the bodies, many of which were badly burned. Most of the corpses were stored in body bags in an old terminal at the airport. Lined up in neat rows, the 70 or so bodies were laid next to caskets of honey pine and dark cherry wood. DNA tests were expected to be completed Thursday. In addition to the 79 people who died in the accident, 39 were hospitalized and 61 suffered minor injuries or escaped unhurt, Chang said. Forty-seven of those aboard were Americans. Within hours, many of their relatives were rushing to Los Angeles International Airport, looking for flights to Taiwan. Ten relatives left on a Malaysian flight Tuesday night, airport officials said. Fifty-five more were to leave late Wednesday aboard a Singapore Airlines plane, airline spokesman James Boyd said. Relatives of other victims also began traveling to Taipei from Singapore and New Zealand on Wednesday. Officials still didn't know what Flight SQ006 might have hit as it tried to take off, but the damage was spectacular: Huge tongues of flames lit up the rainy night sky as the plane broke into three pieces. Afterward, parts of the fuselage were badly charred. Foong _ who survived the crash _ ``saw an object on the runway and he tried to take off to avoid the object, and he hit the object,'' said Clements, who wouldn't speculate about what the plane might have struck. Chou Kuang-tsan of the Aviation Safety Council, which investigates Taiwanese air accidents, said the plane apparently swerved off its runway and onto a spare runway that was under repair. Chou said it was not clear why the plane would have done that. The airline said there was no evidence that the plane was using the wrong runway. The plane's debris flew across the two adjacent runways upon impact, which might have led to the speculation about the plane being in the wrong place, Clements said. Chou said he will begin analyzing the plane's ``black boxes,'' or flight data and voice cockpit recorders, on Thursday. ``We still can't rule out any possibilities,'' he told reporters. Theories about the crash abounded in Taiwan's media. Local TV stations suggested the pilot might have tried to take off from the wrong runway and slammed into construction equipment near the strip. TV reports showed a damaged crane near the accident site. Others speculated that strong winds blew construction debris into the path of the plane. The accident was the first major one for Singapore Airlines, consistently voted the most favored airline of business travelers. The plane that burst into flames Tuesday was bought new in January 1997, had had no problems and had undergone a maintenance check on Sept. 16, airline officials said. ___ On the Net: http://www.singaporeair.com

Families of Singapore Airlines crash victims began arriving in Taiwan early Thursday to retrieve their loved ones' bodies as officials tried to determine what caused the plane to burst into flames during takeoff, killing 81 people _ at least 23 of them Americans.

As Taiwanese guards stood at attention near the caskets, dozens of local Buddhists walked slowly around the area early Thursday, chanting and ringing a bell to honor the dead. Outside, volunteers made soup for the relatives of the victims, but none had arrived yet to inspect the bodies. In addition to the 81 people who died in the accident, 40 were hospitalized and 58 suffered minor injuries or escaped unhurt, said Taiwan civil aviation officials. Forty-seven of those aboard were Americans, and on Wednesday President Clinton offered condolences to people who lost family members and friends in the crash. ``It's too early to know the cause of the accident, but the United States is helping Taiwan authorities to find the answers'' by sending investigators to Taipei, Clinton said in Washington. Within hours after the crash, many victims' relatives were rushing to Los Angeles International Airport looking for flights to Taiwan. Ten flew out of Los Angeles aboard a Malaysian flight and arrived in Taipei early Thursday. Fifty-five more Americans were to leave late Wednesday aboard a Singapore Airlines plane, airline spokesman James Boyd said, and relatives of victims from Singapore and New Zealand began arriving in Taipei earlier in the day.

Pope denies acting illegally and President Clinton and Secretary Of State Madeleine Albright have called for his release on health grounds but Russian prosecutors are pressing ahead as The World's Nened Chebeck reports from Moscow. The trial was suspended earlier in the week because of Pope's poor health. Pope has a history of bone cancer but a doctor working for the FSB, the Russian security service, pronounced Pope fit enough to stand trial today. The proceedings are held behind closed doors and Pope's lawyer said today that his client is still very weak and that he wants a new interpreter, says the current one works for the same agency that has charged Pope. The lawyer Padella Stokovs says his client is innocent when it comes to espionage. The whole case as Stokovs claims is an exercise in politics. This is the first time in almost 40 years that a foreign national is being tried for espionage. It's quite blatant. Officials from the security force, which used to be the KGB, are openly boasting about taking an American citizen to court. Way back in 1961 US military pilot Garry Powers was tried and sentenced but later on exchanged for a captured Soviet spy. But Powers was caught red-handed. His U2 spy plane was brought down by Soviet Air Defenses. Pope was arrested as he was trying to purchase blue prints for what he says is a 10-year-old underwater propulsion system or as the prosecutions claims ultra modern, secret Russian torpedoes. Former Russian Army Intelligence Officer, Vitaly Schlikov says Pope could easily have been a victim of the Russian obsession with secrets. We have of course a secrecy culture in this country for decades and decades and reminisce of it are coming to the surface in this case. The laws on secrecy are still intact from the times of the Soviet Union. Guilty or not, Pope is being held under a very harsh regime in the Moscow Lefrotovo prison where his wife Sherry visited him last week. We took two pictures of our grandson and they won't let him keep the pictures and I took a coat and gloves and they wouldn't let him have those, but we did get to embrace and we did get to talk about our family for one hour. Prison rules say that an inmate can only receive approved gifts on the first and third Thursday in a month. And Sherry Pope's short-term visa didn't enable her to stay that long. She says she even appealed to the Russian President. Ed's mother and I both wrote letters to President to ask him to please take into consideration that Ed is 54 years old and that we want him home. Military intelligence analyst Vellary Schlikov says Putin is probably caught between a rock and a hard place when it comes to the American's trail. I'm sure that it came unexpected for Putin. He wouldn't have approved on a case like this because politically it is very harmful but he came from the ranks of the FSB himself. He has to pretend that he is sticking to his guns in this case. In Schlikov's opinion, Pope is likely to get convicted. But he believes that immediately after the sentencing Pope is likely to be pardoned by Moscow. US Congressman John Peterson, who has been championing Pope's cause, says he fears that might be too late for Pope. The main thing we have been pushing for months is health care. Earlier we had asked for an American doctor to see him. When they continued to say no then we found Russian doctors. The judge delayed the trial for a day and a half so we could furnish her with a list of doctors and hospitals in Moscow and after we provided that information she said no. Pope's lawyer Pavelo Strakovs says that what the authorities here call medical care is a joke. In Pope's case medical control means everyday testing for his suspected cancer. What they do here is take his blood pressure and temperature. The very least they could do is take blood tests and bone marrow tests. The court has even rejected our demand for medical expertise to establish whether he is fit to stand trial. As Strakovs says he does not trust the Judge Nena Barkova at all. He says she has rejected almost every one of his 40 objections and suggestions during the trail so far. Strakovs is now trying to arrange for fresh witnesses for his defense of Edmund Pope, but is not hopeful that even that will be granted by the court. For The World, this is Nened Chebeck in Moscow.

ST. PETERSBURG, Russia (AP) _ ``Mustn't despair'' _ these words from Lt. Dmitry Kolesnikov's note, scribbled in the dark inside the sunken submarine Kursk, were displayed in a black frame Thursday next to his flag-draped coffin. Funeral services for Kolesnikov, one of the 12 sailors whose bodies have been recovered from the wreck by deep-sea divers, were held in his hometown of St. Petersburg. The recovery of the note helped revive public criticism over the military's slow response to the Aug. 12 disaster. Written as he and other sailors huddled in an intact rear compartment after explosions ripped the front of the submarine apart, it showed that at least some sailors survived the initial catastrophe _ despite official claims that everyone had died almost immediately. His widow, Olga, sat with his father, a retired submarine sailor, his mother and his brother Alexander, also a submarine officer, in the hall at the Admiralty, the czarist-era naval headquarters and a city landmark for its soaring golden spire. Russian Orthodox priests chanted funeral prayers, and black-clad sailors fired a graveside salute. Mourners tossed earth onto the coffin, slowly covering it and the naval officer's hat placed on top of it. The note read: ''15:45. It's too dark to write, but I'll try by touch. It seems there is no chance, 10-20 percent. We hope that at least someone will read this. ``Here are lists of the personnel of the compartments who are in the ninth (compartment) and will try to get out. ``Hi to everyone. Mustn't despair.'' The time, 3:45 p.m., was more than four hours after two explosions sank the vessel. Officials have not yet indicated whether a list of names followed, or released the full text. They have said the note contained lines written to Kolesnikov's family which they will not release. Kolesnikov's mother, Irina, told The Associated Press her son's death certificate gave the cause of death as carbon monoxide poisoning. No explanation was given about the source of the gas. Kolesnikov's funeral was attended by St. Petersburg's governor, Vladimir Yakovlev, and Northern Fleet commander Vycheslav Popov, and was covered by all three national television channels. Servicemen's funerals, especially of the more than 2,500 killed in the war with rebels in Chechnya, usually do not get national TV coverage or VIP attendance, and families of the Chechnya war dead have grumbled about the discrepancy. Officials have heaped praise on the Kursk crew, perhaps mindful of public criticism that the navy lacked rescue equipment to reach the sunken sub and initially refused foreign help. Norwegian divers opened the submarine nine days after the sinking and were the first to determine there were no survivors. On Thursday, divers halted work cutting into the third section of the submarine after video footage showed massive damage inside that could risk their safety, Northern Fleet spokesman Igor Babenko said. The divers risked puncturing their pressure suits or air tubes if they ventured further. The divers began work on carving a hole in the hull of the adjacent fourth section in hopes of recovering more bodies, Babenko said. The fourth section is farther away from the torpedo rooms in the nose, where the explosions occurred. ``Work was stopped because of the threat to the divers' lives and safety,'' Babenko said. The video footage showed ``major damage in the (third) compartment,'' including machinery that had been blasted back from the second compartment in the explosion, he added. Earlier in the week, the divers stopped working on the eighth and ninth compartments in the rear of the submarine, where Kolesnikov's body and 11 others were retrieved.

Following are excerpts from the note written by Lt. Dmitry Kolesnikov, who died in the sunken nuclear submarine Kursk. The full contents of the note have not been released, and officials say it contains lines written to Kolesnikov's family that will not be made public. The following lines were displayed in a black frame next to Kolesnikov's flag-draped coffin at his funeral Thursday: ''15:45. It's too dark to write, but I'll try by touch. It seems there is no chance, 10-20 percent. We hope that at least someone will read this. ``Here are lists of the personnel of the compartments who are in the ninth (compartment) and will try to get out. ``Hi to everyone. Mustn't despair.'' Navy chief Adm. Vladimir Kuroyedov read these excerpts to journalists on Oct. 26: ``All the crew from the sixth, seventh and eighth compartments went over to the ninth. There are 23 people here. We made this decision as a result of the accident. None of us can get to the surface.''

a runway mix-up apparently caused tuesday's plane crash in taiwan. investigators say the singapore airlines jet should have been on runway five-left, but instead, it was on five-right. a parallel runway. the plane hit construction equipment. that's part of it right there. investigators say they don't know why it was on the wrong runway. it was raining at the time. they hope the plane's flight recorder will help solve the mystery. the pilot is being kept in taiwan for questioning. 81 people were killed in the accident, which took place amid poor visibility and driving rain. the airport has no ground radar, so air traffic controllers could not have known the pilot took a wrong turn.

overseas today, one of taiwan's leading aviation investigators said pilot error played a role in the crash this week. 81 people died. we also know now that the pilot was saying in the cockpit certain things that made it clear he was in difficulty. we know he tried to take off on a runway that was closed for repairs. here is abc's lisa stark. the location of the 747's debris tells the story. most of it found on a runway that was closed for repairs. the runway he should have taken takeoff on is 5 left, which is this one. the runway he took off from is 5 right, which is this one. controllers cleared him to the correct runway. the captain acknowledged that. but he turned 800 feet too early. a transcript of the voice recorder tells what happened then. he looks out through the rain and says, we see the runway, not so bad. as the plane reaches 163 miles an hour, the pilot sees something in his path. he uters an expletive and something, something there. one second later, a banging noise. then a series of crashing sounds as the plane smashes into a concrete barrier and construction equipment. it was our pilot and the aircraft. it should not be on the runway. as i say, we accept full responsibility. there are also questions about the airport's responsibility. some of the runway's lights were on and the runway was not blocked off. family members have learned tragically what aviation officials have been warning, that runway accidents are now the number one safety hazard. lisa stark, abc news, new york.

An independent investigation into the past month's violence, reported on Friday, echoed many Palestinian accusations against Israel. Still, Palestinian officials criticized it for finding that one publicized Palestinian death was the result of a traffic accident, rather than a killing. A report by the Physicians for Human Rights, which is based in Boston, documents what it said was a consistent pattern of the Israeli army shooting live bullets to wound and disperse unarmed rioters, a practice prohibited by army guidelines unless Israeli lives are at risk. But the Israeli army did not use exploding bullets or other internationally banned ammunition, as Palestinian officials have charged, according to the American forensic pathologists who conducted the investigation. An examination of hundreds of Palestinian casualties in October also found that scores were killed or badly injured by rubber-coated steel bullets fired at close range, another contravention of army rules, said the report. The Israeli army ``used live ammunition and rubber bullets excessively and inappropriately,'' the report said, charging that soldiers ``appeared to be shooting to inflict harm, rather than solely in self-defense.'' Yet while the investigation appeared to corroborate many Palestinian accusations against Israeli forces, its findings about one bitterly contested case were angrily dismissed by Palestinian officials and human rights activists. The death of Issam Judeh on Oct. 8 was the result of a traffic accident, as the Israeli army originally reported, rather than a killing by the Israeli army, as Palestinian officials asserted, according to the doctors. The doctors made an extensive study of photographic evidence, x-rays, hospital reports, Judeh's clothing and his damaged automobile. Judeh's death had been the most widely cited example in Palestinian media of a killing by Israeli settlers and soldiers. The Ramallah hospital where Judeh's body was brought announced that the body showed signs of brutal torture, including burns. Photographs of his disfigured corpse were given prominent play in Palestinian newspapers and television reports. Israeli and Palestinian officials said local anger over Judeh's death led to the mob deaths of two Israeli soldiers in Ramallah. Dr. Robert Kirshner and Dr. Nizam Peerwani, forensic pathologists who have conducted studies of torture deaths in Africa, the Balkans and Central America, said they found no indications of torture or burns. As is common in Muslim and Jewish culture, where burials traditionally take place shortly after death, there was no autopsy, and the available evidence showed injuries consistent with an auto accident, the doctors said. Judeh's body had been found by his wife on a roadside near his damaged car. ``I don't think that the hospital was trying to mislead people,'' Kirshner said in a telephone interview from Chicago. ``I think it is because of ignorance of the injuries, the lack of forensic training. You see this all over the world. But what concerns me is that even after we told them it was an accident, some officials continued to portray it as a murder.'' Peerwani said in a telephone interview from Texas that he presented the conclusions personally to Muzer Sharif, the Palestinian deputy minister of health, who had announced that Judeh had been killed by Israelis. But Sharif said Friday night that without an autopsy, the pathologists' report was simply speculative. ``We are still committed to what we announced,'' Sharif said. ``We are fully convinced that he was killed as a result of torture.'' Separately, a private Palestinian human rights organization, LAW, sent copies of the photographs and medical records to a British forensic specialist, Dr. Christopher Milroy, who also concluded that Judeh died in a car accident. Abrasions had been misinterpreted by Ramallah doctors as burns, Milroy said. LAW, which also characterized the death as a slaying, has questioned Milroy's conclusion, as well as the new report by the Physicians for Human Rights. ''What we received is an opinion. It is not a report,'' said Khader Shkairat, LAW's director. ``We are still committed to the version that he was killed deliberately.'' The examination into Judeh's death was one part of a broader investigation that included a detailed analysis of 31 deaths over a 24-day period in Gaza, including that of 12-year-old Muhammed el-Dura, whose televised killing became a global symbol of the conflict. Like most of the dead in Gaza, the boy, shot in the chest and abdomen, was killed in Gaza's Netzarim junction by high-velocity bullets from an M16, the standard Israeli army rifle, the report said. Thirty-eight percent of the deaths were of children below the age of 18, and 14 percent were under 15, the report said. ``Obviously, this is not a genocide, but in a setting of civil violence this is a tremendous amount of casualties,'' said Peerwani, whose research in Bosnia and Rwanda has been used in war crimes prosecutions. The Boston human rights group said half of the fatal gunshots in the Gaza cases studied were to the head. The investigation was based primarily on local hospital records, including posthumous x-rays. ``Most Palestinian casualties were unfortunately shot in the upper body for the simple reason that they committed shootings and terrorist acts against Israeli solders and citizens,'' the Israeli army said in response to the report Friday night.

we turn now to a campaign for the u.s. senate which is without precedent. mel carnahan as you may know was killed in a plane crash 2 1/2 weeks ago. but his name is still on the ballot in his attempt to unseat the republican senator john ashcroft. as a result, senator ashcroft is forced to do something highly unusual, campaign against a decease opponent. nor norah o'donnell has a look at the most unusual senate campaign in this country. today in kansas city, gore asked voters to keep a legacy alive. let's pull that lever for mel carnahan on tuesday and send jean carnahan to make sure that fire never goes out. governor bush was in missouri thursday to boost senator john ashcroft. i want to thank my friend senator john ashcroft. we need to send him back to washington. this senate race turned upside down by his opponent. jean carnahan plans to accept a seat to the senate if mel carnahan wins. this is probably the first ad to ever tout a dead candidate. cast your votes. mel carnahan's name will still be on that ballot and his vision for missouri can still prevail if we want it to. ashcroft called the ad political. i'm not going to comment on mrs. c ra rnahan making a political commercial. until this week, ashcroft had canceled all political events, pulled his television advertising and watched his lead in the polls slip away. the latest msnbc news rueters poll shows ashcroft trailing his opponent. this week after voting by absentee ballot, ashcroft acknowledges his campaign has suffered. it hurts in the polls. we were doing very well and frankly the race has tightened up substantially. but doing the right thing is an important thing. that's why i'm in government. and if it costs me the election, i would still do the right thing. republicans are now worried. and asking the question how do we run a campaign against a dead person? former senator john danforth says in this new ad what's happening to ashcroft is not right. ashcroft says he will stick to the issues and carnahan advisors says jean carnahan has no plans to hit the campaign trail as both sides worry about appearing too political at a time when the state is still mourning the loss of its governor. but experts say the imp thi vote may help carnahan and that ashcroft is in a political straight jacket. another i think the best thing he could do is to say here's what i stand for. here's my record, please vote for me. but other than that, i think it would be a backlash that would cost him dearly if he criticized her in any way. if mel carnahan does win, state and national republican leaders warn they're challenge the appointment of jean carnahan.

Three days of talks between North Korea and the United States about North Korea's missile program ended Friday without conclusion in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, throwing into doubt the likelihood of a visit by President Clinton to North Korea. Administration officials said Friday that they had not expected an agreement at the sessions, which came on the heels of a trip to North Korea by Secretary of State Madeleine Albright. Even so, there now appears to be less enthusiasm for a presidential trip, and a White House official made plain Friday that Clinton would definitely not be going to North Korea at the tail end of his visit to Brunei and Vietnam later this month, as had been discussed. ``Whether the president goes is a function of what we think it would accomplish,'' a senior administration official said. ``If there are simply a bunch of vague assertions of what might happen _ that is not as compelling as if there were a significant set of understandings to be achieved.'' Because the issues in the talks are high-stake and complicated, questions were raised on Capitol Hill and among Asia experts about the wisdom of a trip to North Korea by a lame-duck American president. There were also questions about whether there was enough time to complete such technical negotiations before Jan. 20. The United States is seeking a shutdown of missile research, development and testing by North Korea as well as an end to its exports of missiles and related technologies. The launch of a long-range missile by North Korea in 1998 was one of the factors that the Clinton administration said propelled it to plan a national missile defense system. Under discussion at the talks in Kuala Lumpur was a proposal under which North Korea would be able to launch civilian satellites on other nation's rockets, an idea that was explored by Albright and the North Korean leader, Kim Jung Il. No new talks were scheduled. Officials said the chief American negotiator at the talks, Robert Einhorn, who had been scheduled to go on to Beijing, would return home for extensive consultations. An array of Asia experts gathered by Albright for advice on North Korea at the State Department Thursday night generally agreed that a visit by Clinton as a lameduck president was probably not prudent, several participants said. ``It was clear to me this group would not want a presidential visit without a firm, unambiguous agreement _ at a minimum _ to bar development, research and testing of missiles and exports,'' said Lee H. Hamilton, who heads the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars. Among the enormous number of details to be worked out in the missile talks is the concept of North Korea's shutting down its missile program in exchange for satellite launches. To move ahead with the launching of North Korean satellites _ which are of the most primitive kind, according to experts _ a consortium of nations would have to be organized. It is still unclear who would participate in the consortium and who would pay for the launchings, officials said. A panel of nonproliferation experts released a study this week opposing the idea of providing satellite launch facilities for North Korea. The panel, headed by Henry Sokolski, the executive director of the Nonproliferation Policy Education Center, said the know-how employed in launching a communications satellite could be adapted for military use.

Missourians like to call their state the gateway to the West, but to political scientists it is the nation's electoral heart monitor. Since 1904, it has backed the winner in every presidential election but one, in 1956, when it picked Adlai Stevenson from nearby Illinois over President Dwight D. Eisenhower. So if that track record means anything, Vice President Al Gore should be worried. He narrowly trails his Republican rival, Gov. George W. Bush, in Missouri polls and has for months. Even the Democrats acknowledge that their own surveys show him running a percentage point or two behind. And Republicans contend that their polls indicate Bush's lead is growing by the day. But in this year of the wavering voter, Missouri keeps both sides feeling nervous one moment, hopeful the next, with Democrats thinking the state's 11 electoral votes remain up for grabs and Republicans worrying that things are far from locked up. And that is why Kansas City and St. Louis feel like Grand Central Terminal on the presidential express these days. Campaign ads, most of them negative, are inescapable on radio and television. Yard signs and billboards are as common as dandelions. And the candidates or their surrogates seem to be in one Missouri town or another every other day. Gore was in Kansas City on Friday, his second visit here in two weeks. Bush was in St. Charles on Thursday, just days after visiting Columbia. Gore's running mate, Sen. Joseph Lieberman, was in St. Louis on Friday; Bush's No. 2, Dick Cheney, was there on Tuesday. In his visit on Friday, Gore invoked Harry Truman, a Missourian who, Gore pointed out, also trailed in the polls on the eve of the 1948 election. ``When someone said to Harry Truman, `Give them hell,' he said, and I repeat in this context, `I'll tell the truth, and they'll think it's hell,''' Gore told several hundred screaming supporters. Partisans on both sides say this election is Missouri's most important in decades, for reasons beyond the presidency. For one, the Republicans have a shot at taking over both the legislature and governor's office, gaining control over Congressional redistricting next year. For another, many Democrats view the election as a referendum of sorts on the life and ideals of Gov. Mel Carnahan, who died in a plane crash last month while campaigning for the Senate against the incumbent Republican, Sen. John Ashcroft. Carnahan's name remains on the ballot because he died so close to Election Day, and his wife has agreed to accept an appointment to fill the seat if Carnahan wins. ``It's turned into a crusade to make sure the issues he stood for remain in the forefront,'' said Bridgette Williams, president of the greater Kansas City AFL-CIO Trying to assess ``the Carnahan factor,'' Kenneth Warren, a political scientist at St. Louis University, said that polls showed Gore and other Democrats surging ahead of their Republican opponents immediately following Carnahan's death. But that surge has ended, and in some cases has reversed. ``I kind of doubt now that his death will have an effect,'' Warren said. ``But I change with the wind, too. I've never seen polls fluctuate this much.'' More than ever, turnout will be crucial. The Democrats are counting on large numbers in St. Louis and Kansas City, as well as in the ``Boot Heel,'' the state's socially conservative but traditionally Democratic southeastern region. Republicans need strong turnout from their rural base. That leaves the St. Louis suburbs, a bastion of moderate Republicanism which accounts for nearly one in five Missouri voters, as the major battleground. One large imponderable will be the impact of a politician not on the ballot: President Bill Clinton. Though Clinton carried Missouri in 1992 and 1996, Republicans assert that the state's electorate will punish Gore for the president's affair with a White House intern and ethical problems. During his visit to Columbia, for instance, Bush made a clear reference to Clinton's travails. ``I understand that the best way for a president to help parents teach a responsible society to their children is for the president himself to behave responsibly,'' he said. And the Democrats seem to agree that Clinton is a potential liability. At the urging of Gore's advisers, Clinton canceled plans to attend a get-out-the-vote rally in St. Louis this coming Sunday that is to feature the Rev. Jesse Jackson and several Hollywood celebrities. Even in endorsing Gore recently, The Kansas City Star chided him for working with Clinton. ``Vice President Al Gore, despite his emphatic declarations now that he is his `own man,' has been tainted by his association with a disreputable, untrustworthy president,'' it said. Still, the editorial concluded, Bush was not fit to be president because he has ``failed to demonstrate the energy, knowledge and intellectual depth that the country should expect from a candidate for the White House.''

Engineerman 3rd class John Thompson said he operated on autopilot as he carried injured crew mates from a mangled steel shell that minutes before was a mess hall aboard the destroyer Cole, wading through water that flooded the hold, past exposed live power lines and thick clouds of smoke until he reached the deck and safety. ``We weren't thinking, we didn't wait for electrical isolation,'' the 22-year-old sailor said Friday, describing how he and three shipmates ignored the rules against moving and working near live electric lines and rescued shipmates in the hours after last month's suicide bombing of the Cole in Aden harbor, Yemen. Thompson was among the 216 members of the Cole's crew who flew home Friday to a hero's homecoming at the naval air station here, greeted by more than 1,000 friends and family members who had waited hours under a bright autumn sky for the plane to arrive from Germany. Boisterous applause and loud whistles greeted the men and women as they walked from the airplane to an official line of Navy dignitaries and a mob of well-wishers. Richard Danzig, secretary of the Navy, and Adm. Vern Clark, the chief of naval operations, greeted the sailors as they stepped onto the tarmac from a chartered DC-10 aircraft. A Navy band played ``Anchors Aweigh'' while family members ran past the ropes where they had waited all morning and thronged around the front of the airplane, throwing flakes of silver confetti and balloons into the air. The first sailor off the plane was Cmdr. Kirk S. Lippold, the skipper of the Cole, who was credited by many sailors Friday for saving the ship after the Oct. 12 explosion tore a 40-by-40-foot hole in the Cole. Lippold, who has yet to speak publicly about the attack, declined to address the families and disappeared into the crowd. Instead, he issued a statement through the Navy. ``I have never been more proud of my crew,'' Lippold said in his statement. ``They responded magnificently to this tragedy _ just as I expected and just as they've been trained to respond. They saved their ship and they saved their shipmates. Each Cole sailor today returns home a hero.'' With two separate military reviews under way to determine whether the Cole failed to set or to follow proper safety procedures, senior Navy and Pentagon officials are eager to give Lippold full support during the arduous investigations. Friday's reunion on an unseasonably warm day seemed to postpone, for the time being, the hard questions and difficult issues that lie ahead and were even voiced by some family members as they waited for their loved ones: Why was the ship vulnerable to attack? What might have been done to prevent it? And who, if anyone, ought to take responsibility for it? Paul Riddle, an operations specialist 2nd class, said he was on deck when the suicide boat carrying the explosives pulled up alongside the Cole. ``It looked just like all the other boats around there,'' he said. ``Two guys were on it, one a really big guy and I kind of glanced at it.'' The only security precautions were officers patrolling the deck with shotguns, he said. He said he saw no special effort to contact approaching harbor boats to make sure they were on authorized business, and knew of nothing done to warn unauthorized boats off or to keep them away, as would have been required under anti-terrorist measures laid out by the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Riddle said he knew of no picket boats patrolling the water around the ship. ``There was nothing out there for protection,'' he said. Dee Zander, the mother of John Thompson, the engineerman who pulled shipmates from the damaged mess hall, was one of the earliest to arrive at the air terminal Friday. She spent the morning trading stories with other families about the days before and after the attack. When the Cole sailed through the Suez Canal more than a week before the ship entered the harbor at Aden, Zander received a last e-mail from her son. He told her that e-mails would not be allowed during that leg of the voyage. At the same time, he said, local vendors were boarding the ship and selling food and souvenirs, to the consternation of several sailors. Zander, a nurse at a Veterans Affairs hospital near her home in Cochranville, Pa., brightened when Adm. Clark told the families that ``the magic of the crew of the USS Cole was the manner in which they pulled together and supported one another.'' Her son used cardiopulmonary resuscitation to help save several of his shipmates and carried Chief Petty Officer Keith A. Lorensen out of the steel-entangled mess hall to safety on the ship's deck. ``This guy saved my life, he pulled me out,'' said Lorensen, who was flown home two weeks ago but came to the homecoming to greet the sailors who rescued him. Several families were still fragile from the long day three weeks ago when they heard the Cole had been attacked but didn't know whether their loved ones had survived. The blast killed 17 and wounded three dozen. Carol Steindorff, the mother of Ryan Schmalz, a 21-year-old fireman 3rd class, said that ``it was a long, really long, rough day before we knew he was all right.'' She said she believed her son was still dazed from the horrors he saw, including the horrendous condition of the boat after the attack. The filth of that deck will ong be remembered by John Washak, interior communications first class, who said the weeks after the attack had ``been hell.'' ``The living conditions we had to endure, sleeping every night on a dirty deck and waking up in the morning to 110-degree heat,'' he said. On top of those problems, the sailor said he and several others couldn't sleep at night after what they had seen happen to their shipmates. ``I didn't sleep for four days and only then with medication,'' he said, hugging his sons, Jonathan, 7, and Joshua, 4. After all that he had witnessed, Washak said, getting off the airplane Friday and hearing the shout from his wife, Theresa, above the noise now ranks ``as the happiest moment of my life.''

Weather on the Barents Sea improved Saturday and Russian and Norwegian divers resumed their search for bodies in the sunken nuclear submarine Kursk, a navy official said. The divers cut an opening in the inner hull over a compartment that served as the crew's living quarters, Northern Fleet spokesman Capt. Vadim Serga said. ``As weather reports predicted, surface conditions were much improved this morning at the site of the disaster,'' allowing the divers to resume their efforts to recover the bodies of the 118 sailors who died when the submarine exploded and sank Aug. 12, Serga said. He said the divers completed cutting a 4.8-inch opening in the inner hull. A larger hole would be cut later to give the divers access, he said. High winds and snow Friday forced divers' to halt efforts to recover bodies from the Kursk. So far, 12 bodies have been recovered, all from the submarine's stern. The divers moved their search toward less-damaged areas of the vessel Friday, after failing to enter a shattered third forward compartment. Before work was suspended Friday, Serga said they hoped to find more crew remains in the fourth compartment, which served as living quarters for the crew. The compartment held bunks, a kitchen and a room for meetings and social activity. At least 23 sailors in the submarine's stern survived the initial explosion, according to a letter found on the body of Lt. Dmitry Kolesnikov. Eight have been identified so far. The cause of the sinking remains unknown. Russian officials have theorized that the Kursk collided with a foreign submarine, setting off the powerful blasts. Others have suggested a technical malfunction caused a torpedo to explode in its tube.

Reporters accompanying Secretary of State Madeleine Albright on her recent trip to North Korea had no chance to see the rusted steelworks, the flooded mines or factories at a standstill. Nor were they able to see the small livestock markets that have sprung up in some parts of the country, testimony, apparently, of farmers' abandoning their collectives and taking matters into their own hands as a matter of sheer survival. But they were able to see that a major hospital had no lights except in the foyer and to hear about operations without anesthesia. They learned of the motto ``Children are king,'' and indeed, Albright saw _ and danced along with _ 5-and 6-year-olds who literally sang the praises of the North Korean leader, Kim Jung Il. Some 15 miles out of the capital, however, children labor on a road-building project, breaking stones by hand, a sight that recently reduced some toughened Western aid workers to tears. Even on a hasty two-day trip, it was clear there are only a few paradoxes in North Korea. The country is overwhelmingly poor, and its people are indoctrinated with a mixture of homegrown ideology focused on self-reliance and communist beliefs from the 1920s and '30s. In contrast to the United States' engagement with the Soviet Union and China, the Clinton administration has made clear that its objectives with North Korea do not include a makeover of the totalitarian regime into a democratic government with a market economy. The major goal is simply to coax Kim to get rid of his missiles and reduce the threat of war. Kim's goals seem equally limited. His country desperately needs help, and if North Korea takes the necessary steps to get off the State Department's list of countries that support terrorism _ which essentially revolves around what to do with three members of a terrorist group, the Japanese Red Army, who are wanted by Japan _ the regime will qualify for support from the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. But even given the modesty of each side's aspirations, if engagement continues, North Korea's people will inevitably come into more contact with the outside world. And that raises questions about how a nation as closed as North Korea will react. Certainly, contacts with the West will come as a shock. But for the moment, the North Korean regime most fears contact between its people and South Koreans, who enjoy a vastly more prosperous life and who in large numbers feel great emotional bonds to their Northern brethren. In the days before Albright arrived, North Korean officials forbade U.S. officials who drove over the demilitarized zone from South Korea to bring their South Korean drivers with them. All signs in English and emblems of South Korea affixed to the U.S. officials' cars had to be covered. But there is not the slightest hint that reunification along the model of East and West Germany is possible anytime soon. East Germany was far more porous than North Korea, where Kim has achieved an Orwellian thoroughness in keeping his people insulated _ all televisions and radios, which broadcast only government material, must be registered. What passes for broadcast news, largely the latest doings of the ``Dear Leader,'' is delivered in a harsh martial voice, and often over street loudspeakers, making it hard to ignore. Because self-sufficiency has been elevated by the state as the ultimate virtue and contrasts with modern prosperity have been shut out, there is little likelihood of immediate demand for the political and social change that brought revolution in the Soviet Union. Any kind of change is likely to come slowly. A few small ruptures in the seal around North Korea's people illustrate how glacial the pace of change may be. Five years ago, the State Department's desk officer for North Korea, Ken Quinones, accompanied by three other officials, landed in the country for an extremely delicate job: overseeing the removal of fuel rods from the Yongbyon reactor that contained enough plutonium for four or five nuclear bombs. The mission was to start the process of closing down the reactor under the terms agreed to between North Korea and the United States in 1994. The Americans, who were bunked at the top secret facility, were made to feel just what they were, Quinones said: enemies on enemy territory. They fought to get the tiniest freedom of movement. Only after agonizing negotiation did they win the right to go for a morning and evening walk to a tree, a quarter-mile outside the gate. (It helped that the tree happened to commemorate the founding leader of North Korea, Kim Il Sung, the current leader's father.) ``Everything was gradual and incremental, with profuse explanations every step of the way,'' said Quinones, who is now the head of Northeast Asia projects for Mercy Corps, a nongovernmental organization specializing in medical help for poor countries, including North Korea. One of the most interesting examples of interaction between North Koreans and outsiders is a joint effort between the government and the Nautilus Institute, a group based in Berkeley, Calif. Two years ago, on a farm west of Pyongyang, Nautilus installed windmills to generate energy for household lighting, a village water pump and a refrigerator in the village kindergarten. To Peter Hayes, the director of Nautilus, the project illustrates how stereotypes can, over time, be broken down. At first, he said, it was hard for the villagers to believe that the American technicians would return after the installation of the windmills, turbines and other equipment _ all of it imported, together with tools for assembling. When the Americans lived up to their promise and did return, some trust was established. Even so, Hayes said, it was hard to get villagers to allow the Americans to inspect their homes to see that the light bulbs initially installed were still working. But this suspicion broke down too. Hayes says he was not surprised when one of the North Koreans on the project told him, ``My mother thinks that all Americans are wolves, and we are the prey.'' But one North Korean showed great gratitude that his family was rescued from the darkness _ due to lack of oil and other energy sources _ that now blankets most of North Korea at night. The most rewarding words Hayes said he heard were from the man who said: ``Thank you, please come back and build more.''

Police fired live ammunition and tear gas Saturday in clashes with voters in three northern villages and, elsewhere, fistfights between supporters of rival candidates in the parliamentary elections turned to gunfire. As night fell, four people were dead and more than 60 people were injured. In Dakahla, 125 miles northeast of Cairo, the capital, police tried to disperse voters angry that security forces had prevented them from casting ballots. An 18-year-old man, Hani Noaman al-Sabbouhi, died after being shot three times in the head, according to hospital officials in nearby Mansoura. At least 24 other people were treated there for gunshot wounds or tear gas inhalation. Egypt's largest Islamic group, the outlawed Muslim Brotherhood, enjoys strong support in Dakahla, and residents in some such areas have complained throughout the three-stage elections that security forces are limiting who votes. Clashes with police are common in Egyptian legislative elections, which are marred by allegations of widespread vote-rigging. In earlier polling during the current elections, police opened fire on a crowd of pro-opposition voters, killing one and wounding a dozen. Thirty-four people were killed in the 1995 elections. President Hosni Mubarak's National Democratic Party controlled 97 percent of the seats in the outgoing parliament and is expected to dominate the new one. Voting Saturday was for run-off contests in the second stage of balloting and covered parts of the Nile Delta, Sinai Peninsula and southern Egypt. Word of trouble came from the Nile Delta. ``We just want our rights. Where's the freedom they are talking about?'' asked Mohammed Shabaan, who said he wasn't allowed to vote. In the village of Idyar, 50 miles north of Cairo, police clashed with supporters of the ruling NDP candidate _ a far less common occurrence. The reason for the clash, involving gunfire and tear gas, wasn't clear. Mohammed el-Sayyed Abu Abiyah and Mohammed el-Sayyed Hallah died shortly after arriving at a hospital in Tanta, 13 miles to the east, hospital officials said. Their ages weren't available. Twenty people were wounded in Idyar, they said. In Atmida, 30 miles southwest of Dakahla, villagers said Sayyed Mohammed Imran, 45, was killed during clashes between police and supporters of Muslim Brotherhood-backed candidate Shafiq el-Deeb. Police said Imran died of heart attack. Elsewhere in the area, at least 24 people were injured in election-day violence. Villagers burned a police car in el-Gamaliyah, 20 miles southeast of Dakahla, where fighting between supporters of rival candidates injured four people, police said. Fistfights turned to gunfights between candidates' supporters in Kafr el-Zaiyat, 60 miles northwest of Cairo. At least 20 people were injured, police said. The clashes in Dakahla stretched throughout the afternoon, with villagers erecting barricades of hay bales on the bloodstained dirt roads that they set fire to in attempts to prevent the security forces from advancing. People crowded around one of the wounded, who lay bleeding in a village street. Residents said they could not take him to a hospital because police had cordoned off the area. An ambulance driver outside the village said he was not allowed to enter. The violence erupted when the villagers were denied access to a polling station to cast their votes. Security forces had blocked the roads to the station. An independent candidate backed by the outlawed Muslim Brotherhood enjoys strong support in the village. Police fired tear gas again later when villagers demonstrated, chanting Brotherhood slogans and the name of the Brotherhood-backed candidate, Mohammed al-Falahgy. Abdel-Aziz Salman, a representative of al-Falahgy, said he was barred from entering the polling station and quoted an officer as telling him: ``No one will vote today. There is no law today.''

President Clinton will not go to North Korea after his upcoming trip to Vietnam but still may make an unprecedented visit to the communist country before he leaves office in January, a White House official said Saturday. The United States and North Korea ended three days of talks Friday in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, without agreeing on a way to curb North Korea's missile program _ the chief obstacle to a possible trip by Clinton. ``The president has not made a decision yet on whether he will visit Pyongyang,'' the North Korean capital, said Daniel Cruise, a spokesman for the National Security Council. ``A decision has been made that it's not going to happen at the end of the (Asian) trip, but the final decision on whether he'll go there before the end of his term has not been made,'' Cruise said Saturday. ``More discussion needs to happen in Washington. We want a fuller readout on the talks in Kuala Lumpur,'' Cruise said from Washington. Clinton was on a political trip in New York. After those talks, Robert Einhorn, assistant secretary of state for nonproliferation, said that although progress was made, ``significant issues remain to be explored and resolved.'' No new talks were scheduled. The dialogue over missiles are a key part of efforts to defuse the world's last major Cold War front and improve terms long-term hopes for peace in Northeast Asia. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who recently made a groundbreaking visit to Pyongyang, said her conversations with North Korean leader Kim Jong Il yielded ``substantial progress'' on security issues. Kim has indicated a willingness to curb missile development and missile exports in exchange for economic ties with the United States. North Korea has been destitute for much of the period since the collapse of the Soviet Union, its main benefactor. White House officials had considered whether to add a brief presidential stop in North Korea to Clinton's trip to Vietnam and Brunei. ``The decision not to go at the end of this trip'' was made just recently, Cruise said. Clinton plans to visit Vietnam at the end of a scheduled trip to Brunei, where he is to attend the annual Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum on Nov. 15-16.

In Egypt President Hosni Mubarak's ruling National Party appears headed for a decisive victory in parliamentary elections. Results from the first-two rounds of voting assured the National Democratic Party 224 seats in the 454-seat assembly. Non-Islamist candidates or independents won 35 seats. A third and final round of voting is to begin Wednesday.

In Egypt, President Hosni Mubarak's ruling party is claiming victory in the second of three rounds of voting in parliamentary elections, but as VOA's Scott Bob reports from Cairo, Islamic candidates also made significant gains accompanied by some of the election's worst violence. Results from the first two rounds of the elections give Egypt's ruling National Democratic Party 224 seats in the next assembly. The party gained dozens of additional seats Sunday when independent candidates pledged allegiance after winning their races. These candidates had run as independents after they were passed over in the nomination process. Meanwhile, candidates of the banned Muslim Brotherhood have won 15 seats in the next parliament; up from one seat in the last elections five years ago. Islamist candidates run as independents because Egyptian law prohibits political parties based on religion. Legal opposition parties including the Waft or Liberal Party and the Leftist Stagamo and Nascist parties have won 10 seats so far in the parliament. The third and final round of voting, including the populous Cairo region, is to begin on Wednesday. A Muslim Brotherhood candidate from the Nile Delta City of Bandadel Mansoor, who lost his race, Saber Zaher, said the message of Islamists is not to win or lose but to be allowed to participate in the process. Mr. Zaher said the group wants to prove to the system it has support among the people and that it is wrong to exclude it. In the run up to the election, security forces arrested scores of Muslim Brotherhood leaders and hundreds of their sympathizers in an effort to weaken the group, which is viewed as the second strongest political force in the country. Islamist leaders have also accused security forces of preventing voters from entering polling stations in areas where the opposition is strong. Four people died and scores were injured in clashes during Saturday's run off election in the Nile Delta province of Dekaharia. One person was killed in the first round of voting. These elections for the first time are being monitored by the Egyptian judiciary. An Egyptian court ordered monitoring by the judiciary after the previous elections were ruled unconstitutional because of widespread irregularities and violence in which at least 60 people were killed.

HO CHI MINH CITY, Vietnam _ ``This present emergency should not last,'' said the top refugee official at the United Nations as desperate people jammed onto helicopters and small boats to flee the communist victory in Vietnam 25 years ago. But it did. It swelled into a vast, clamorous flood of nearly 2 million people, more than half of whom settled in the United States. It was an unexpected artifact of the Vietnam War, and just as unexpectedly, it continues today. When President Clinton visits Vietnam later this month, in the first trip by a sitting U.S. president since the end of the Vietnam War, he will arrive in a country that is increasingly linked to the United States by an ongoing web of migrants who journey from teeming cities like Ho Chi Minh City, formerly known as Saigon, to cities and towns across America. The result is that 26,000 Vietnamese a year now emigrate to the United States, helping to shape both countries and forming one of the half-dozen largest flows of immigrants into America from any country in the world. ``It's going to outlive us all,'' said W. Courtland Robinson, the author of a recent book on the refugee exodus. ``I don't think anyone in 1975 thought it would last more than a few months or a few years. But here we are, all these years later, seeing not just the last vestiges but a new manifestation of this migration.'' The immigrants are going, they say, in search of an American dream of prosperity and education that shines as bright here as anywhere in the world. ``I would go too if I had the money,'' said Nguyen Xuan Hien, 74, who is sending his 11-year-old granddaughter to join her parents in New Orleans. ``She'll have a better life there. Conditions here in Vietnam are not perfect, you know.'' Most of the immigrants now are part of what one consular official called ``an expanding pyramid'' of family reunification in which refugee citizens reach back to their homeland to bring their parents, children, siblings and spouses _ who then, eventually, will send back for more relatives. But some, remarkably a quarter century later, are still technically refugees fleeing the distant echo of a war. At the rate of nearly 2,000 a year, these refugees include the aging survivors of re-education camps and the grown children of U.S. soldiers as well as hundreds of participants in a little-known program that is still cleaning up the last lingering cases of what became a huge refugee-processing bureaucracy. On their journey, they are crossing paths with some 100,000 Vietnamese Americans who now return every year to visit or do business in Vietnam. This human flow will bind the United States and Vietnam for generations to come, but, like the war, it also serves to some degree to divide Vietnam. Both the migrants and the returnees are mostly from the south, America's former ally against the victorious communist north. Although Vietnamese attitudes toward America are generally cordial today, there is a warmer and more intimate tone to them among many southerners. And it is mainly the south that enjoys a notable windfall from this relationship: an estimated $2 billion a year sent back to family members from the 2 million or so ethnic Vietnamese who now live in the United States _ double the total amount of foreign aid received by the government. Paradoxically, this cash amounts to a far greater contribution to Vietnam's economy than these former refugees could have made had the police caught them, years ago, and prevented them from fleeing the country. In another twist, the same authorities who once imprisoned people attempting to flee now appear to be encouraging the last refugee cases. ``The Vietnamese government occasionally hassles us about the slowness of our processing of these cases,'' said Charles A. Ray, the U.S. consul general in Saigon. ``I have on at least four occasions gotten a letter from the external relations office complaining that our processing is taking too long. It's an odd transaction: these are people going on refugee programs.'' Many of those cases involve people who have spent much of their lives in refugee camps, trying for decades to reach the United States or other countries. When the camps around Asia closed down in 1996, more than 100,000 people who had failed to gain asylum were obliged _ sometimes forcibly _ to return to Vietnam. As part of the deal, the United States promised to interview these returnees one more time. Though they are still required to prove ``a well-founded fear of persecution'' long after hostilities have ended, the Vietnamese are often given the benefit of the doubt by immigration officials, diplomats say. In numbers of people resettling in America, Vietnam now ranks behind only Mexico, China and India as well as two traditional sources of immigrants, the Philippines and the Dominican Republic. Among the applicants at the consulate here the other day was Vu Nguyen, 25, an Amerasian who knows nothing about his father but still holds a hope of finding him. He is taking with him his 4-year-old son _ the grandson of a U.S. soldier he may never know. Le Thi Thu Ngan, 33, was heading to join her new husband, a Vietnamese-American who returned here recently, as many do, to find a Vietnamese bride. She is a mathematics teacher who speaks no English. Le Thi Minh Trang, 28, was going to join her father, a former inmate at a re-education camp, bringing along her two small sons. ``I don't know if I'll like it there but I'm going for the future of my children,'' she said.

The election-day parties usually thrown by American expatriates in the Middle East will be muted this year: Alarmed by rising anti-U.S. sentiment here, many Americans plan to keep a low profile. In Bahrain, the U.S. Embassy has canceled a party planned for Tuesday. And the U.S. State Department has warned Americans in the region to be cautious because of the anti-U.S. mood, whipped up recently by Israeli-Palestinian violence. ``I don't think U.S. citizens are going to be as vocal or outspoken on election day,'' said Marcy Fletchall, a U.S. academic in the United Arab Emirates. ``In terms of going out and partying in large numbers, I don't think that's going to happen,'' said Fletchall, who teaches at Zayed University in Dubai. ``We're following the (U.S.) consulate's orders.'' Thousands of Arabs have demonstrated against the United States in the past five weeks, condemning it for what they regard as a pro-Israel position on the deadly Israeli-Palestinian clashes. Protesters pelted the U.S. Embassy in Damascus, Syria, with stones and pieces of garbage. In Cairo, Egypt, students burned the U.S. flag. Riot police had to fire tear gas to disperse protesters marching on the U.S. embassies in Amman, Jordan, and Manama. The threat to U.S. personnel and property was heightened by the Oct. 12 bombing of the USS Cole in Yemen that killed 17 U.S. sailors. In Bahrain, spokeswoman Donna Winton said security concerns led the U.S. Embassy to cancel an election party planned at a bar in Manama. Instead, the embassy will hold an election function on its own premises, Winton said. In Israel, where U.S. presidential elections are usually an excuse for American residents to cut loose, the U.S. Embassy said it would be holding no public events on Tuesday night. Spokesman Larry Schwartz said he was not at liberty to say why. But the Israeli newspaper Ha'aretz quoted local Republican and Democratic leaders as saying they would be no big celebrations because of the prevailing atmosphere. Three other U.S. embassies in the Middle East said their election night parties would be more discreet than in 1996, but their spokesmen would not admit that security was the reason. In Jordan, the U.S. Embassy said it would not hold any events on Tuesday night but that it would hold a celebration later. In 1996, the embassy sponsored an all-night party at a sports club. In Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates, the embassy plans to hold a small gathering for invited guests. In 1996, the embassy gave a big party at a hotel. In Cairo, the ambassador has invited some of the country's estimated 16,000 Americans to a party at his residence, spokesman Dave Ballard said. Ballard said security was not an issue. ``If we'd known there was so much demand, we would have had it at one of the hotels as we've done in the past,'' he said.

we also want to remind everyone, of course, control of the congress, the house and the senate also on the ballot this time. while it's always difficult to track the 435 house seats, the senate this year is particularly tough to call. the republicans have a 54-46 majority going in, and as nbc's lisa myers reports, the congressional races will add an extra dimension of drama tomorrow night. with both the house and senate up for grabs, all eyes are on endangered incumbents like republican senator john ashcroft of missouri in the bizarre position of ru a dead man. this is a race that has had a lot of tragedy. a lot of unique circumstances. ashcroft's opponent, missouri governor mel carnahan, died in a plane crash last month, but is still if he wins, his wife says she'll accept an appointment to his senate seat. i've decided to do what i think mel would want me to do. what he wants all of us to do, to keep fighting with all the strength we can muster for the values and ideals that he lived for. ashcroft is one of seven senators in trouble. behind or even in the polls. six are republicans. 79-year-old william roth of delaware hurt by the age issue. he fell twice during the campaign. also in tough fights, grams of minnesota, abraham of michigan, gorton of washington, and burns of montana. for the democrats to win the senate, experts say they probably must defeat five of those six republican senators, plus win an open republican seat in florida, then hold almost all democratic seats except nevada which they expect to lose. democrats are counting on hillary clinton winning in new york and senator chuck robb coming from behind to hold on in virginia. the key for democrats to capture control of the senate is virginia. if they don't hold onto chuck robb's seat, then it's almost impossible for them to do it. even if they do, it's still uphill. it's still like drawing an inside straight in poker. in the house, it's also an uphill battle for the democrats, who need to pick up at least six republican seats to win back control. that's tough because there are less than three dozen truly competitive house races in 23 states. democrats would have to win a big chunk of them. at the top of the democrats hit jim rogan. being one of the house prosecutors during impeachment hurt in his increasingly democratic district. i did what i thought was right, and i'm prepared to stand or fall on that issue and every other issue that counted. though republicans are believed to have a slight edge tomorrow, many house and senate races are so close that control of both bodies could depend on a few thousand votes in a few states. in fact, both parties already have teams ready to demand recounts. lisa myers, nbc news, the capitol. one possible key for turnout tomorrow, as always, the weather. it looks like it might be a rainy day in parts of the midwest, home to many of those crucial battleground states. could be some snow in the mountain states, the east and west coast, however, should have fine voting weather.

George W. Bush and Al Gore campaigned into the final hours in their run for the White House on Monday, seeking last-minute momentum in a costly and exhausting race to become the nation's 43rd president. The Texas governor said he trusted that Americans had ``heard our message'' _ compassionate conservatism and a less intrusive government. The vice president urged a Democratic vote to maintain the nation's economic prosperity. Gore anticipated a long count on Election Night, and joked that his first meal as president-elect would probably be breakfast. ``But I'm going to make it a Happy Meal from McDonald's,'' he told an Iowa audience. In Florida, Bush was confident he would return Republicans to the presidency lost by his father in 1992. ``We've laid the groundwork for victory,'' he said, ``now it's up (to us) to get people to the polls.'' Candidates for the 107th Congress went through their final paces, Republicans and Democrats focusing their energy and money on four or five dozen highly contested races likely to determine control of the House and the Senate. The polls gave Bush a small edge in the popular vote, a position he gained after overtaking Gore in public opinion surveys during October. But the decisive Electoral College seemed less predictable. It takes 270 electoral votes, a majority, to win the White House. Key swing states included Florida (25 electoral votes); Pennsylvania (23); and Michigan (18); and an aggressive Bush campaign bid as well for Gore strongholds such as California (54) and Tennessee (11). Some aides worried that Green Party candidate Ralph Nader would damage the vice president's chances of succeeding Bill Clinton by diluting the Democratic vote in swing states like Oregon and Wisconsin. Under pressure from Democratic liberals to back off, Nader countered: ''...The only wasted vote is for someone you don't believe in.'' Gore expressed no concern, saying, ``I think by tomorrow, particularly with the election this close, most people are going to want to participate in the main choice.'' The candidates' itinerary and pace told the story on the final day of a long and costly campaign. Gore embarked on a 30-hour nonstop journey beginning in Iowa, then heading to Missouri, Michigan and Florida before flying home early Tuesday morning to Nashville, Tenn. ``I think that what is involved in this race is whether or not we are going to have policies that keep our economic good times rolling and extend them to the people who've not yet shared in those good times,'' the vice president said in an early morning interview on NBC's ``Today.'' ``I have a passion to do what's right for your family,'' he said later in Flint, Mich., touching on issues ranging from health care to campaign finance reform to targeted tax cuts. Bush's schedule projected his confidence: from Gore's home state of Tennessee, he flew to Wisconsin, Iowa and Arkansas, four states that Clinton carried twice, before returning to his residence in Austin, Tex. ``My opponent vows to carry his home state,'' Bush said in Chattanooga. Gore ``may win Washington DC, but he's not going to win Tennessee.'' Later, in Green Bay, Wis., as he has in hundreds of stops in the past year, he said a Republican victory would mean ``a fresh start after a season of cynicism'' in Washington. One survey suggested that Bush headed into Election Day with his supporters more enthusiastic than Gore's backers, a potential advantage in a close race. The poll, by Pew Research Center, found that 32 percent of Bush's voters said they strongly support him, compared to 26 percent for Gore's supporters. Just beneath the presidential line on the ballot, some of the most memorable congressional campaigns in years were nearing an end. Democrats need to gain eight seats to wrest control of the House; and five in the Senate. Hillary Rodham Clinton, trying to make history as the first Lady to win a Senate seat, campaigned through New York with comedian Bill Cosby and Buffalo Bills quarterback Doug Flutie. ``I know some people say she is from out of state,'' said Flutie. ``Doug Flutie's from out of state but we fight hard. We try to deliver for Buffalo and she will too.'' Her opponent, Rep. Rick Lazio, sought support in the New York City suburbs. In next-door New Jersey, investment banker Jon Corzine tested the limits of self-financing. Dipping into his own pocketbook for a record $50 million or more, he faced a surprising challenge from Rep. Bob Franks. Half a continent away, Gore made a pitch for the late Missouri Gov. Mel Carnahan, whose name remains on the ballot for a Senate seat. ``You know what we say, keep the fires burning,'' the vice president said in St. Louis. ``It means to vote for Mel Carnahan and send his partner, who shares his hopes and values, to the United States Senate.'' Carnahan's widow, Jean, has said she would accept appointment to the Senate if her late husband is victorious against Sen. John Ashcroft on Tuesday. Among the House races, Rep. Jim Rogan fought to hold his seat in southern California in an $8 million battle with State Sen. Adam Schiff that will end up to be the costliest House race in history. The results will be closely watched in Washington where Rogan was a leader in the successful effort to impeach Clinton. The political parties assembled massive get-out-the-vote operations. Karl Rove, Bush's chief strategist, said that in the campaign's final 10 days, the governor's operation would place 70 million phone calls, send 110 million pieces of mail and deploy 243,000 volunteers in 28 states. Democrats geared up too, buttressed by allies in organized labor and a celebrity or two. Actor Jimmy Smits and actress Janelle Maloney, of West Wing, were on the final day of a three-day fly-around for Democratic candidates, with stops in Iowa, Wisconsin and Illinois. ``Go door to door and keep working the phone banks,'' Republican vice presidential candidate Dick Cheney told volunteers in Nevada. Sen. Joseph Lieberman, Gore's running mate, placed get-out-the-vote calls in Minneapolis. ``Hey Marie, believe it or not, this is Joe Lieberman. I am running for vice president,'' he told one skeptical voter.

chris matthews, hillary is now senator hillary and al gore continues. thanks god for us journalists. we're going to have a lot to cover the next years. this woman will probably be instantly next to ted kennedy the most well-known u.s. senator. the most quoted, she will dominate in terms of quotations next year. what else? she certainly will dominate conservative mailing listses -- combined. i think she'll be the new news, and i think clearly she'll become a target and the think the interesting thing will be how does she work in the club? it's still a good old boys club in spite of the fact there's more women than ever before. can you see hillary clinton the first time she walks on to the senate floor and one of the party whips has her thumb up or on down and tells her how to vote? what a sight that's going to be. i'm afraid no one is ever going to be able to tell hillary rodham clinton how to vote. that's one thing that's for including her husband. she has very strong opinions. is this going to shake up our form of electing senators? we've done it gee graphically so many years. bobby kennedy grew up in bronxville. just walk into a state based upon their sheer celebrity power and say i would like to be your power. sort of the british system. are we going to go there in the 21st century? i think we're looking at that. one is the celebrity factor, the second is money. you have candidates who can spend $60 million, $65 million. but everyone knows hillary clinton the day she arrives, what an advantage. it also means money, too. the ability to move into states where people invite them to come in because they need someone to compete. the senate races get this expensive, i think you'll see more and more states turning and saying we have to get somebody to run for us and we will see the british system where you bring someone in to run in a constituency. this may be the real trend we're opening up tonight. the white house has dominated press coverage from washington since the kennedy administration, fewer and fewer big time reporters being assigned to capitol hill. on the same level as the white house correspondent. sam donaldson, dan rather, they all made their names at the white house. could it now be the top assignment on the hill in washington is going to be cover hillary up in the senate? i think there's no question, and particularly as you start looking to the senate numbers. this could end up a 50-50 senate. in which case it will raise the question whether mel carnahan, if he's elected in death, despite the fact that the u.s. constitution requires that the candidate be alive, and then -- an inhabitant at the time of election, you might find that lieberman was elected and not serve, mel carnahan elected and obviously cannot serve, what a strange thing. a woman who never lived in the state. a guy who has passed away -- one more. the vice president doesn't get sworn in until january 20th. he could be sponsor in as a senator -- brian, back to you.

The closing of polls in St. Louis was delayed for 45 minutes after a state judge ruled that turnout was so heavy there that it had overwhelmed the polling places. Circuit Judge Evelyn Baker, in granting a request filed by Democrats in the state, had ordered the polls to stay open until 10 p.m., three hours longer than in the rest of Missouri. But the state's appeals court overturned that ruling, after an appeal by Republicans, and ordered the polls in St. Louis to close at 7:45 p.m. But Vice President Al Gore, the Democratic nominee, stood to gain by the voting extension, since he was running far ahead of Gov. George Bush of Texas, the Republican nominee, among urban voters. The request for a voting extension had been filed by state Sen. William Lacey Clay, a Democrat, who is seeking the congressional seat left open by the retirement of his father, Bill Clay. Lawyers for Gore had joined the state Democrats in asking for the voting extension. Lawyers for Bush had fought the extension, and filed the successful appeal in the state's appeals court. The voting extension infuriated Republicans in Missouri, who said it would unfairly aid both Gore and the Senate campaign of the late Gov. Mel Carnahan, the Democrat whose name remains on the ballot. If Carnahan, who was killed in a plane crash on Oct. 16, wins in the Senate race against Sen. John Ashcroft, the Republican, the state's new Democratic governor, Roger Wilson, would appoint a candidate to go to the Senate. Carnahan's widow, Jean Carnahan, has said she would accept an appointment to serve in the Senate. State Sen. Christopher Bond, a Republican, who is not seeking re-election, said the extension allowed the Democrats to perpetrate a fraud in the election. Democrats, meanwhile, argued that the voting rights of people in St. Louis had been denied, since a shortage of voting booths left many voters standing in long lines, unable to vote. Bekki Cook, the secretary of state in Missouri, had earlier predicted an extraordinarily high rate of voting in the state, perhaps as much as 66 percent.

Republicans scored an important victory Tuesday when former Gov. George Allen defeated Sen. Charles Robb in Virginia, a turnover that led Democratic leaders to say they would not regain control of the U.S. Senate. Even with final results yet to come in a few states that Democrats hoped to win, Sen. Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the minority leader, said that at best ``we could be at 50-50 in the Senate.'' But that would still leave the Senate in Republican hands. Sen. Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut, who lost as Vice President Al Gore's running mate, will now return to the Senate, eliminating the risk that Gov. John G. Rowland could have appointed a Republican to succeed him. With Dick Cheney elected vice president, he would preside and cast a tie-breaking vote for the Republicans. The Democrats did win four Republican Senate seats, defeating Sens. William Roth of Delaware, the five-term incumbent who heads the Finance Committee, Rod Gramms, a Minnesota freshman, and John Ashcroft in Missouri, as well as taking the seat vacated in Florida by the retiring Sen. Connie Mack. Incomplete returns for the House of Representatives suggested that a Democratic bid to capture control there was also faltering. Republicans held on to two sharply contested Kentucky seats, those of Reps. Anne Northup in Louisville and Ernie Fletcher in the Lexington-Frankfort area. Those results presaged a series of victories by incumbents of both parties who had seemed in danger this fall. But Samuel Gejdenson, a 20-year Democratic veteran from Connecticut, apparently lost to state Rep. Robert Simmons. Democrats took an open Republican seat in Oklahoma, but Republicans won Democratic seats in Virginia and Pennsylvania, and the parties swapped seats on Long Island. In all those races, incumbents were not running again. The Democrats needed a net gain of seven seats to retake the House, which they also lost in 1994. They had been assured of one pickup _ in California, where no Republican was running to succeed Rep. Matthew Martinez, who only became a Republican last spring after losing the Democratic primary. With several close races anticipated on the West Coast, a final House tally was not expected before Wednesday at the earliest. In Washington state, which has three hotly fought House races and a competitive Senate battle, officials estimated that as many as half the votes would be cast by absentee ballot. They said they were not sure how long it would take to count them. The Senate races featured the bizarre Missouri contest, in which the late Democratic governor, Mel Carnahan, defeated Ashcroft, after Carnahan's widow, Jean, said she would accept an appointment by Missouri's Democratic governor to fill her dead husband's seat. A federal judge ordered the polls held open an extra three hours in St. Louis, where Democrats had sought extended hours because of huge lines and a heavy turnout. But after less than an hour of added voting time, Republicans, who complained that it was unfair to give Democratic St. Louis extra voting time, won an appeal to close the polls. Republicans conceded they did not have the votes to defeat Carnahan, but vowed to fight the outcome in court. The bitterly fought Virginia race, where back-to-back television ads competed to call each candidate a liar, gave Allen a clear but unspectacular victory. Allen rolled up votes in rural areas. A heavy black vote helped Robb, but fell short of the overwhelming majorities of more than 90 percent he recorded four years ago when he defeated former Lt. Col. Oliver North. ``Once the Virginia race was called for George Allen, Democrats' odds of retaking the Senate became very, very long,'' said Jennifer E. Duffy, who tracks Senate races for the Cook Political Report, a nonpartisan newsletter in Washington. Still, Duffy said, a burden rested on two embattled Republicans in Michigan and Washington. In the Delaware race, Roth, 79, promised to use his seniority to deliver political plums to the tiny state, while Gov. Thomas Carper, 53, vowed to bring new energy to the job, in a veiled reference to his rival's age. Late in the campaign, Roth fell twice, once in from of television cameras, and the falls only served to underscore public concerns about his health. ``For many people, this was a tough choice,'' Carper said in a telephone interview Tuesday night, ``but in the end they looked to the future.'' Carper sidestepped questions about whether he felt that concerns over Roth's health turned the election in the governor's favor. Going into Tuesday's balloting, the margin of control of the House was the closest since 1954, when there were 219 Republicans, 215 Democrats and one independent on Election Day. In that election, Democrats won 232 seats and Republicans 203. This year, there were 222 Republicans, 209 Democrats, two independents _ one of whom votes with each party _ and two vacancies, one caused by the death of a Republican and the other by the death of a Democrat. But after the Republican landslide of 1994 swept out vulnerable Democrats and weaker Republicans were thinned out in the 1996 and 1998 elections, no more than three dozen seats were left that constituted real battlegrounds, and the parties and outside interest groups poured millions of dollars into them. Republicans had far more retirements, which led to open seats that are usually easier to win than seats that are defended by incumbents. Headed into Election Day, both parties had predicted they would capture control. The Senate, though, was not that close. Headed into Election Day, Republicans held 54 seats while Democrats had 46. In both houses, Democratic gains were expected, but a change of control seemed unlikely, though not impossible. One test for Democrats was their ability to hold seats that had been opened by the retirements of Democratic incumbents who could have been easily re-elected themselves. They did so in New York with Hillary Rodham Clinton, the first first lady to run for office, who won election to the seat held by Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the Democrat who had served four terms. She defeated Rep. Rick A. Lazio, R-N.Y. The Democrats' task was almost as easy in New Jersey, where Jon Corzine, an investment banker, poured $60 million of his own money into winning the seat vacated by fellow Democrat Frank Lautenberg. Corzine defeated Rep. Bob Franks, R-N.J. Democrats seemed sure to end the night with gains in the Senate. In the Florida contest for Mack's Senate seat, Bill Nelson, the Democratic state insurance commissioner, defeated Rep. Bill McCollum, a 20-year House veteran and a manager in the impeachment effort against President Clinton. In Minnesota, Grams was beaten by Mark Dayton, an heir to the Dayton-Hudson department store fortune and a former state auditor. In one closely watched House race, the Democrats picked up a seat vacated by a retiring Republican, Tom Coburn of Oklahoma. Coburn kept his pledge to retire after three terms, but his handpicked successor, Andy Ewing, was defeated by Brad Carson, a Democratic lawyer. But state Sen. Ed Schrock, a retired admiral, won one of the most heavily militarized districts in the country, in Virginia Beach and Norfolk. He defeated Jody Wagner, a Norfolk lawyer, to take the seat that opened when Owen Picket, a Democrat, retired. In Pennsylvania, state Sen. Melissa Hart won a seat that has been Democratic for decades, a seat that opened up when Rep. Ron Klink made an unsuccessful effort to unseat Sen. Rick Santorum, a freshman Republican. In New York, Felix Grucci, a Republican, won the Long Island seat that opened when Michael P. Forbes, a Republican turned Democrat, was defeated in the primary. In the neighboring district, Steve Israel, the Democrat, defeated Joan Johnson for the seat vacated when Lazio ran against Clinton.

Republicans retained their hold on the Senate for two more years Tuesday though by a narrower margin, as Democrats boasted history-making triumphs by first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton in New York and a dead governor in Missouri. Remarkably, joining Mrs. Clinton in the Senate winners' circle was Jean Carnahan, widow of Missouri Democratic Gov. Mel Carnahan, killed three weeks ago in a plane crash. In perhaps Election Day's most poignant drama, he outpolled GOP Sen. John Ashcroft anyway, and she has said she will accept the new governor's appointment to the job. ``We remain heirs of a legacy, heirs of a dream,'' Mrs. Carnahan, 66, told her followers. ``On this night, I pledge to you, rather, let's pledge to each other, never let the fire go out.'' No one had ever posthumously won election to the Senate, though voters on at least three occasions sent deceased candidates to the House. Some Republicans have said they might challenge the Carnahan victory, asserting that the late governor was no longer a state resident. But for now, the Carnahan win assured Democrats at least 47 seats _ more than enough to use the minority's power to wreak havoc with the GOP's legislative agenda by forcing procedural delays. ``Democratic power was enhanced tonight without question,'' Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., said in an interview. ``The Senate is never easy,'' conceded Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., who easily won re-election himself. The three remaining races in Nebraska, Michigan and Washington state were all too close to call. Though the GOP majority will be no better than 53-47 _ compared to this year's 54-46 margin _ a victory by two-term incumbent GOP Conrad Burns in Montana ensured that Republicans would have at least 50 of the Senate's 100 seats. That is enough for them to control the chamber, no matter if Republican George W. Bush or Democratic Vice President Al Gore was elected president. A Gore victory would elevate his running mate, Connecticut Sen. Joseph Lieberman, to the vice presidency, opening the door for GOP Connecticut Gov. John Rowland to name a Republican to replace him in the Senate. A victory by Bush would make Dick Cheney vice president, in line to break any tie votes in the Senate. Holding the majority gives Republicans their first eight-year stretch of Senate supremacy since the 1932 elections ended 14 years of unbroken GOP control. Of the 29 incumbents seeking re-election, three others besides Ashcroft were toppled from office by early Wednesday: veteran Democratic Sen. Charles Robb of Virginia and GOP Sens. Rod Grams of Minnesota and William Roth of Delaware. Roth, 79, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, lost his bid for a sixth term to Delaware Democratic Gov. Thomas Carper. Roth's age had become a factor in the race after he stumbled twice publicly. Of the 40 percent of voters who said Roth's age would hinder his ability to serve effectively, nearly nine in 10 said they voted for Carper, according to exit interviews by Voter News Service, a consortium of the AP and television networks. Republican George Allen, the former governor of Virginia, ousted Robb after two terms in the Senate. Robb, son-in-law of President Lyndon Johnson, was the last Democrat holding statewide office in the GOP-trending Old Dominion. ``It would be a major disappointment to me if the results of this race mean the difference'' in Republicans keeping control of Senate, Robb said in his concession speech. But in a remark that every victorious candidate would assuredly second, Allen told cheering supporters, ``Tonight we begin moving forward and it sure is sweet.'' In Minnesota, department store heir Mark Dayton used millions of his own money to defeat the conservative Grams, who served a low-profile single term and was beset by a divorce and other personal problems. Mrs. Clinton's bitter battle against Lazio, the upstart four-term congressman from Long Island, became an expensive contest that drew donors from across the country in what was partly an emotional proxy referendum on Bill Clinton and his presidency. Underlining how Mrs. Clinton's candidacy polarized voters, about half of Lazio's supporters said in interviews that they were mainly voting against Mrs. Clinton. But despite Lazio's efforts to cast Mrs. Clinton as an out-of-state carpetbagger, half of voters interviewed said the issue didn't bother them, and strong majorities of women, blacks and Hispanics supported her. ``Thank you for opening up your minds and your heart, for seeing the possibility of what we can do together,'' she told cheering supporters at a Manhattan hotel, her beaming husband and daughter, Chelsea, beside her. Democrats got a boost in New Jersey where Democrat Jon Corzine, after spending more than $60 million of his own fortune, held onto a seat vacated by Democratic Sen. Frank Lautenberg. Corzine, a former chief executive officer of Goldman Sachs, outspent four-term GOP Rep. Bob Franks by 10-1, making it the costliest two-candidate Senate race in history. Franks' effort to make Corzine's record-setting expenditures an issue fell short. In Florida, Democrat Bill Nelson, the state's insurance commissioner, grabbed the seat of Republican Sen. Connie Mack, who is retiring. Nelson defeated GOP Rep. Bill McCollum, who was a manager during President Clinton's impeachment trial and spent his campaign trying to moderate his conservative image. But former Republican Rep. John Ensign nabbed the Nevada Senate seat vacated by the retirement of Democratic Sen. Richard Bryan. Ensign, who narrowly lost a 1998 Senate bid, easily defeated Democrat Ed Bernstein. Sen. Zell Miller, D-Ga., appointed to replace the late GOP Sen. Paul Coverdell, easily won the remaining four years in Coverdell's term. By capturing more than half the vote in a field of seven candidates, the popular former governor averted a Nov. 28 runoff. Based on history, neither party expected the presidential candidates to have much impact on the Senate struggle. The last time a winning presidential candidate's party also gained Senate seats was Ronald Reagan's 1980 GOP landslide. Three committee chairmen breezed to re-election: Agriculture Committee Chairman Richard Lugar of Indiana, Health and Education Committee Chairman James Jeffords of Vermont and Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch of Utah. A Democratic icon, Sen. Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts, first elected in 1962, won his seventh full term. And Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., the second-longest serving senator ever, won his eighth term. Also winning re-election were Republican Sens. Mike DeWine of Ohio, Bill Frist of Tennessee, Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas, Olympia Snowe of Maine and Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania. Other incumbents re-elected included Democrats Kent Conrad in North Dakota, Jeff Bingaman in New Mexico, Dianne Feinstein in California, Daniel Akaka in Hawaii and Herb Kohl in Wisconsin. Republicans Craig Thomas in Wyoming and Jon Kyl in Arizona also won. Republican Lincoln Chafee of Rhode Island was elected to his own six-year term a year after being appointed to the seat after the death of his father, John, who had been a revered institution in the state's political scene. Though there were no national issues common to the Senate contests, most shared an underlying factor: money. From January 1999 through Oct. 18 of this year, 108 candidates in the 34 Senate races reported raising $327 million, 52 percent more than the same period two years earlier. That excluded the roughly $80 million raised by the National Republican Senatorial Committee, a figure nearly matched by its counterpart, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. Also untabulated were as many millions of dollars in unregulated soft money that corporations, unions and other interest groups use to buttress each side. The money spent by Corzine, former chief executive officer of Goldman Sachs investment bank, was expected to more than double the previous record for a Senate candidate. California Republican Rep. Michael Huffington used $30 million in a losing effort against Democrat Dianne Feinstein in 1994. Huffington and Feinstein combined for $44.4 million, the previous record for total spending in a Senate race. The Clinton-Lazio race also surpassed that contest, with Lazio reporting spending $33 million through Oct. 18 to Clinton's $26 million.

In the biggest race of her young career, at the 1964 Olympics, Judy Martz choked. In the contest of her life, at the Montana polls, she did not. The 57-year-old Republican, a one-time speedskater, was elected Tuesday as Montana's first woman governor. And in Delaware, Democratic Lt. Gov. Ruth Ann Minner, a statehouse receptionist in the 1970s, now gets to run the place. Those gubernatorial victories put women in charge of five states _ the highest number in history. But the trend did not hold in North Dakota, where Democratic Attorney General Heidi Heitkamp battled breast cancer and banker John Hoeven. She was diagnosed in September, had her right breast removed, and within a week returned to campaigning while undergoing chemotherapy. ``We'll just never know what the health challenge meant to me,'' Heitkamp said, conceding defeat. Across the country, 11 states elected governors. Democrats held seven offices they had at stake, and picked up another in West Virginia, where Cecil Underwood, America's oldest governor at age 78, lost to Rep. Bob Wise. In Missouri, term limits stopped popular Gov. Mel Carnahan from seeking re-election, but death couldn't stop him from being elected to the U.S. Senate. The Democrat was killed three weeks ago in a plane crash. His wife, Jean Carnahan, has said she would accept appointment to assume the seat her husband won. And the next Missouri governor is State Treasurer Bob Holden, who edged Republican Rep. Jim Talent in a stomach-churning race that wasn't declared until nearly 3 a.m. Wednesday. In Vermont, an uproar over gay rights failed to cost Gov. Howard Dean the job he's held for four terms. The Democrat won his fifth term against a challenger incensed over a new law sanctioning same-sex civil unions. Republican Ruth Dwyer promised to work toward repealing the measure, which Dean signed six months ago. Dean was conciliatory in victory. ``We also have to be mindful of those who did not win, those who believe their view did not prevail,'' he said. With the incumbent's loss in West Virginia, the number of Republican governors will be 29, with 19 Democrats and two independents. The GOP held onto power in Utah, where Gov. Mike Leavitt easily won; in Montana, where Martz beat state Auditor Mark O'Keefe; and in North Dakota, where Hoeven beat Heitkamp. Democrats won in Washington, Delaware, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Missouri, Vermont, West Virginia and Indiana. Washington incumbent Gary Locke, the nation's first Chinese-American governor, defeated former radio talk show host John Carlson. Delaware's Minner, who worked as a statehouse receptionist some 30 years ago before a lengthy legislative career, won 59 percent of the vote to defeat former GOP lawmaker John Burris. For New Hampshire, gripped by financial crises in its schools, the governor's race was a milestone. Incumbent Jeanne Shaheen reversed her opposition and became the first candidate in decades to win without taking ``the pledge'' to veto a state income tax. She won 49 percent of the vote against former Sen. Gordon Humphrey, who opposed the tax, and garnered 44 percent. In North Carolina, Attorney General Mike Easley defeated Republican Richard Vinroot, a former mayor of Charlotte, by 52 percent to 46 percent. Popular Democratic Gov. James Hunt was barred by a term limit from re-election. Gov. Frank O'Bannon won a second four-year term in Indiana, defeating Republican Rep. David McIntosh by 57 percent to 42 percent. In Vermont, exit polling illustrated the divisiveness of same-sex unions. Of 832 responses _ the largest sample yet polled on the issue in Vermont _ 51 percent declared themselves either enthusiastic or supportive of the law, and 47 percent were opposed to or angry about it. The four-point difference was equal to the margin of sampling error in the Voter News Service poll.

In an election for the ages, the presidency remains in doubt, the House remains Republican by the slenderest of threads and the GOP Senate majority teeters, depending in part on the longevity of 97-year-old Strom Thurmond. And not even Thurmond, who first won local office in 1928, has ever seen another election like this one. And as close as it is _ George W. Bush and Al Gore each went to bed early Wednesday morning with victory a possibility in the race for the White House _ divided government emerged the winner by far. It's a safe bet little thought has been given to building a governing majority in a country that split its ballots almost exactly down the middle. ``Our campaign continues,'' Gore's campaign manager William Daley told hopeful Democrats waiting out a long, rainy night in Nashville. ``Unbelievable,'' said Bush adviser Karen Hughes after Gore called the Texas governor to retract a concession offered in an earlier conversation. Clearly, tax cuts, health care, Medicare and a debate over the defense missile shield will have to wait for another day. Confirming new Supreme Court justices, if any retire, should be interesting. Should Bush win Florida and the White House with it, his call for an era of civility in Washington will be almost wholly dependent on the Democratic leaders in Congress. Should Gore take the oath of office on Jan. 20, 2001, he'd be confronted with at least one chamber of Congress controlled by the political opposition. Organizing the House for business figures to be, if anything, more complicated than it has been the past two years. Republicans must elect new chairmen to replace those who were term-limited in the heady days of the Contract with America six years ago. Democratic leader Dick Gephardt has yet to publicly discuss the results of the House elections, or offer any hint of his own plans. ``Dick Gephardt's goal was to run against a do-nothing Congress,'' Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., said in an election-night interview. ``Now is the time to put politics aside.'' The House trend showed Republicans in control, but with a handful of races still out, likely to suffer losses in their already meager majority. In the Senate, Democrats whittled the Republican advantage by half or more. With a Washington state race still too close to call, the GOP held a majority of 50-49. But that could yet change if Gore wins the White House and Sen. Joseph Lieberman resigns his Senate seat to become vice president. If so, his seat would go to a Republican by virtue of Connecticut GOP Gov. John Rowland's authority to appoint a replacement. Other possible departures are talked about openly by aides in both parties. Thurmond, for example, who walks unsteadily on the arm of an aide, is two years from the end of his term. All of this makes some of the other remarkable developments of the evening seem mundane by comparison. New Yorkers elected first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton to the Senate, a first for the spouse of a president. Now her husband will have the opportunity to attend her oath-taking in the very chamber where he was tried on impeachment charges two years ago. Missouri voters cast their ballots for a dead man, the late Gov. Mel Carnahan, with full knowledge that his widow will be appointed to that seat. Carnahan's victory at the ballot box is unlikely to be the last word on that race, though. Republicans have talked openly of a lawsuit, noting that the Constitution requires a senator to be ``an inhabitant'' of their state when elected. Beyond that, the GOP leadership would be confronted with a decision of whether to challenge Mrs. Carnahan's credentials. The presidential race alone was closer than any in history. By a lot. In 1968, Richard M. Nixon barely beat Vice President Hubert H. Humphrey by 0.7 percent of the vote. In 1960, John F. Kennedy defeated Nixon by 0.2 percent of the vote. But in both those cases, the Electoral College outcome was clear. This time, with votes tallied from 96 percent of the precincts, Gore had 47,242,846 and Bush had 47,101,968 votes. Green Party candidate Ralph Nader was at 3 percent and Pat Buchanan barely registered. The Electoral College showed Bush with 246 votes and Gore 255. It takes 270 to win. Florida, Oregon and New Mexico were unsettled, but the Sunshine State was the key. And there, nearly 12 hours after the polls closed, Bush held a lead of fewer than 2,000 votes.

Braving scattered violence, Egyptians voted Wednesday in the final phase of parliamentary elections that are chipping away at the monolithic power of President Hosni Mubarak's governing party. Opposition and independent candidates, among them members of the outlawed Muslim Brotherhood who ran as independents, have already won 17 percent of the seats decided during the first two rounds of voting. Members of the brotherhood, the oldest Islamic fundamentalist movement in the Arab world, have so far won 15 seats despite a monthlong campaign of arrests and police intimidation against their supporters. The elections have been hailed by opposition and government officials as some of the cleanest in Egypt's history. Following a Constitutional Court ruling, judges were ordered to supervise each of the country's 15,256 polling stations. The limited number of judges forced the government to spread the elections over a period of several weeks. The voting Wednesday, concentrated in Cairo and its suburbs, will decide 160 seats. The National Democratic Party is still expected to finish the elections with a solid, although diminished, majority. In the departing Parliament, elected in 1995, the party controlled 94 percent of the seats, giving the president a virtual rubber-stamp for his domestic programs. But analysts said the party has been chastened by the strong showing of its opponents. ``It's not like it used to be with lists of dead or nonexistent people and ballots that were filled out in advance of the vote in police stations and NDP offices,'' said Diya Rashwan, an analyst with the Al Ahram Center for Political and Strategic Studies. The ruling party did not know how to campaign or mobilize voters, he added, ``because they never had to.'' Violence marred the scene at several locations in Cairo. In the Dokki neighborhood, Maamoun Hodeiby, the deputy chairman of the Muslim Brotherhood, was attacked as he drove to polling stations. Hodeiby, an independent candidate, escaped injury although the tires of his car were slashed and a mob beat on the doors with sticks. At one of the polling stations in the district, a group of knife-wielding men and women assaulted Western and Arab journalists covering Hodeiby's campaign while in full view of uniformed police officers standing about 20 feet away. Government officials said they had received nine complaints from foreign journalists who reported that police officers stood by as they were beaten by people on the street and had their equipment destroyed. In other incidents around the city, supporters of different candidates fought in the streets, and some polling stations were opened by the police only to voters selected from the waiting crowds by aides to the National Democratic Party candidates. In New Maadi, a poor suburb where a member of the Muslim Brotherhood was a candidate, officers refused to let women vote if they wore the all-encompassing cloaks favored by conservative Muslim women. ``They are not letting anyone in except NDP people,'' shouted Abdel Barri Abu Sreaa, an independent candidate who said his supporters were not being allowed inside. Turning to a group waiting to vote, he begged: ``Please don't leave. Sooner or later, they have to let you in.'' Analysts in Cairo said the National Democratic Party, which is headed by Mubarak's son, Gamal, suffered a more severe shock than its poll numbers indicated. In announcing the results from the first two rounds of voting, the government credited the party with the victories of more than 100 independents. Interior Ministry officials said they were former ruling party members and so would be immediately taken back into the fold.

Texas Gov. George W. Bush claimed cautious victory Wednesday in the unresolved presidential race. The outcome of his race with Democrat Al Gore hung on Florida and the uncertain fate of its 25 electoral votes. ``This morning brings news from Florida that the final vote count shows that Secretary Cheney and I have carried the state of Florida,'' Bush told reporters in a midday appearance. ``If that result is confirmed in an automatic recount, as we expect it to be, then we have won the election.'' Gore, for his part, slept past noon and remained cloistered with advisers or relatives in Nashville. He planned to thank campaign workers later in the day and then escape for several days to Center Hill Lake in Smithville, Tenn., not far from the Gore family farms in Carthage. Asked whether the Gore campaign would mount a court challenge if the Florida recount did not go Gore's way, campaign chairman William Daley replied: ``I doubt it.'' Americans cast some 100 million votes Tuesday _ 48,591,357 for Gore and 48,421,815 for Bush. That left the Bush-Cheney ticket and the Gore-Lieberman ticket tied at 48 percent. Despite Bush's assertion of a complete vote in Florida, a small number of absentee ballots remain uncounted. Fewer than 1,800 votes separated the two men at last count, with Bush having the edge. Bush, with running mate Dick Cheney at his side, seemed matter-of-fact as he spoke with reporters outside the governor's mansion on the morning after a nail-biter of a night. Earlier, during a lunchtime photo session inside the mansion, Bush was more animated, even venturing a few jokes. Bush said he had dispatched former Secretary of State James A. Baker III to oversee the recount under way in Florida, with final results expected on Thursday. Daley said former Secretary of State Warren Christopher would oversee the recount for the Democrats. Gore himself thought he had lost Tuesday night, when the broadcast networks projected Bush the winner in Florida _ and thus the nation. The vice president telephoned his congratulations to the Texas governor. Then he called again and took his concession back. In the wee hours, Daley finally appeared in Gore's stead to tell a crowd of supporters: ``This race is simply too close to call.'' Standing in the rain, the Nashville crowd chanted, ``Recount!'' Bush's hometown newspaper, the Austin American-Statesman, had to stop the presses after printing 59,000 copies with the front-page headline ``Bush!'' TV networks and many other newspapers also proclaimed Bush the winner. The Associated Press did not, citing the narrowing vote count. By dawn, it was clear the race was not over. The AP tally showed Bush leading by 1,784 votes in Florida, and both the Bush and Gore campaigns were sending teams of lawyers to the state Wednesday to keep an eye on the recount. The election stacked up as the closest race since John F. Kennedy defeated Richard M. Nixon in 1960 by 118,574 votes, a contest whose outcome was also uncertain until the day after the voting. Bush and Gore were both in reach of the 270 electoral votes needed to win the presidency. As dawn broke in the East, Bush had won 29 states for 246 electoral votes. Gore had won 18 states plus the District of Columbia for 255. The presidential races in New Mexico and Oregon, like Florida, were too close to call. Green Party insurgent Ralph Nader failed to get enough votes to qualify for federal funding in 2004, but he took enough _ presumably from Gore _ to emerge as the potential spoiler to the vice president. The congressional race was narrow as well. Before the election, Congress was Republican but closely divided and it emerged Republican and even more closely divided following Tuesday's voting. Republicans picked up six Democratic House seats in scattered states, enough to renew their hold for two more years. But their majority shrank when they gave back eight other seats elsewhere, including four in California. ``We figured it was going to be close,'' said House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill. _ and it was. With winners declared in 33 of the 34 races at stake, Republicans have at least a 50-48 margin in the Senate. Too close to call was the race in Washington state, where former Rep. Maria Cantwell was challenging incumbent Republican Sen. Slade Gorton. Voters ousted Sen. William V. Roth of Delaware, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee and father of the tax-saving Roth IRA, as well as four other Republicans and Democrat Chuck Robb of Virginia Missourians rejected Republican Sen. John Ashcroft, electing instead their dead governor, Mel Carnahan, killed three weeks ago in a plane crash. His successor has pledged to appoint widow Jean Carnahan, who told supporters, ``I pledge to you, rather, let's pledge to each other, never let the fire go out.'' In New York, Hillary Rodham Clinton became the first president's wife to win a Senate seat. When word of his wife's victory came in, President Clinton was on the telephone in their hotel suite, talking to a personality named Billy T on Las Vegas radio station KCEP, trying to nudge Westerners to the polls. Clinton told Billy T he was the first president in history to have a wife in the Senate ``and I like it.'' Regardless of the outcome of the presidential race, Joseph Lieberman is assured of a job. Lieberman was bidding to become the first Jewish vice president, but he also easily won re-election to the Senate from his home state of Connecticut. If the Democrats win the White House, he would be replaced by a Republican appointed by the state's GOP governor. Bush, whose father, President George H.W. Bush, was defeated by Clinton in 1992, had the satisfaction of carrying both Clinton's and Gore's home states of Arkansas and Tennessee. Bush, in Austin, Texas, ate dinner and said he was worried more about what the suspense was doing to his parents than to himself. He did not address his supporters, who waited deep into the night in a cold rain. And Gore, aides said, went to bed. Voter turnout was higher than expected, a notch above 1996, when fewer than half of the adult population cast ballots. On Tuesday, between 52 percent and 53 percent voted, estimated one turnout expert, Curtis Gans, director of the Committee for the Study of the American Electorate. ``It's kind of neat to be that important,'' said Barbara Garwood, 50, in Orlando, Fla., who voted for Bush. She made that comment at a time it appeared that Florida had delivered victory to Bush. Some voters saw the election as a referendum on Clinton's stewardship. ``I don't want another eight years of the kind of administration we've had,'' said David Fair, a Knoxville, Tenn., priest who voted for Bush. ``I feel our country has become less moral.'' But Gordy Janisse, 48, a custodian in St. Clair Shores, Mich., pointed to the economy to explain his vote for Gore. ``Why try to fix something that's not broke?'' he asked. ``It's common sense.'' Exit polls showed that voters who cared most about taxes and world affairs supported Bush, while those most concerned about Medicare, prescription drugs, Social Security, the economy and education favored Gore. Bush was the solid favorite among men and white voters and the wealthy, while Gore won among women, blacks, Hispanics and those earning below $30,000 a year, according to the exit interviews, which were conducted by Voter News Service, a consortium of The Associated Press and the television networks. Nader won just 3 percent of the national vote, short of the 5 percent that would qualify his party for federal campaign funds in the 2004 elections but good enough to potentially tip several states to Bush _ Florida among them. Nader was unapologetic Wednesday, and predicted continued growth for the Greens. ``This is the beginning of the end for the two-party duopoly,'' he said. About half of Nader voters said in exit polls they would have voted for Gore in a two-way race; about 30 percent said they simply would not have voted without Nader in the race. ``I voted for Nader because I didn't like any of the other candidates,'' said Melissa Larson, 22, a student at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee. ``I'd rather have Gore (than Bush), but I couldn't bring myself to vote for him.'' The Reform Party's candidate, Pat Buchanan, barely registered.

In Moscow, today there was a dramatic plot twist in a real life courtroom drama. A lawyer for US spy suspect, Edwin Prope said that the main prosecution witness has retracted his testimony. According to Prope's attorney the witness said he provided the evidence under pressure from the Russian Secret Service. Eversince Prope was arrested 7 months ago, the American businessmen has denied charges that he was gathering secret information on a new high-speed Russian torpedo. The Worlds Menet Scheveck, is following the trial in Moscow. Menet, go back and tell us just how we got here? Who is Edwin Prope and why is he on trial in Russia? Well, Edwin Prope is a retired American intelligence officer and that's sort of speaks against him when it comes to the Russian public and certainly the Russian court. He has claimed that he is now just an innocent businessman, who was dealing with the Russian businesses orbit in the Defense Industry. He has, however, claimed that he is only dealing with the de-classified military material and that when it comes to these torpedoes that we are talking about, that he was buying an underwater propulsion system, which is 10-years old. What the Russian prosecution is claiming is that Pope was actually after ultramodern secret high-speed Russian torpedoes. Okay, so tell us what happened in the trial this morning and bring in this professor from one of Moscow's elite universities who is a key witness? The big news of today was that Pope's attorney distributed to journalists this morning a letter, which he says was written by Tolly Babkin, who is a Professor at Moscow's Bowmen Technical Institute, who until now was considered to be the main witness for the prosecution. He says that he gave that evidence under pressure having had a grave heart condition proceeding a heart attack. Professor Babkin says that he never actually met Edwin Pope face to face, nor has he given him any kind of sensitive information, therefore, his former testimony is to be considered as not corresponding to reality says this letter by Professor Babkin. However, the court today again, this is what we were told by Pope's lawyer, has decided not to accept this change in testimony. The court said that Professor Babkin had ample opportunities to appear in the court. What is not clear at this moment is that whether it will allow a personal appearance by Professor Babkin, in which he could sort of say what he said in this letter. Then I would assume that the Professor is still ailing. I mean, is he able to take the stand, is there any indication that he will be asked to? No he is not able to take the stand at the moment. He is recuperating after a heart attack, but Pope's lawyer has said that court session could actually take place in the apartment of Professor Babkin. We still have to wait and see whether the court will accept that. So how important is this evidence? I mean how pivotal a figure is he? Is he providing evidence of no one else can? Well. From what we have heard so far, this is supposed to be like a key witness, a very important witness, but then the first reaction came from the FSB, the Federal Security Bureau, which is the former KGB, they are the ones who are prosecuting Pope. Their spokesman said today that their evidence is far from being based only on Babkin's testimony. He said that FSB has evidence given by other witnesses and experts, as well as, written documents and videos. This is not, what would know as a standards of American style trial certainly, first of all of the proceedings are conducted entirely in secret. What is the defense attorney for Admen Pope saying about the conduct in the trial? Well. He is very unhappy with the main judge. Pope is not being trailed by Jury. He has been trailed by panel of judges headed by judge Nina Barkolla and what we have heard from the defense attorney Pavals Tokov is that she has rejected almost every single one of, over 40 objections and suggestions that he has so far submitted during the case. He is very unhappy with the way she has been conducting the whole case and also with the fact that she has denied Edmund Pope the proper medical attention that he has asked for. And what has like that it happened should Admen Pope get convicted. Would he actually serve time? Well. Most of the people I have spoken here believe that that would not be the case, that since the case is already being brought to court that he is most likely to get convicted, but will then afterwards be pardoned either by the president or the parliament, and then sent back home for reasons of ill health, but most people here do expect a conviction at the end of this trial. It was Menet Shebeck in Moscow talking to us about the espionage trial in Moscow of American Admen Pope. Thank you very much Menet. You are welcome Lisa. This is PRI, Public Radio International.

It was a strange and unusual Senate race: A dead man and his widow running against an incumbent. And the outcome was just as unusual, if not unlikely: They won. On the day after, the loser, Sen. John Ashcroft, a Republican, announced that he would not challenge the results, essentially assuring that Jean Carnahan, 66, wife of the late Gov. Mel Carnahan, the Democratic candidate, would fill the Senate seat. Carnahan won with 50 percent of the vote, compared with 48 percent for Ashcroft. The margin of victory was about 49,000 votes. Ashcroft also said Wednesday that he would discourage other Republicans from challenging the outcome of Tuesday's election, something that Republicans had privately said they might do. ``You have to know when people speak with clarity, how to take orders,'' Ashcroft said Wednesday, adding that voters had clearly demonstrated their wishes. ``I reject any legal challenge to this election. I will discourage others from challenging the will of the people in the selection of their United States senator.'' He added: ``I believe the will of the people has been expressed with compassion. The people should be respected and heard.'' Jean Carnahan did not speak publicly Wednesday afternoon. But Tony Wyche, a Carnahan campaign spokesman, expressed cautious optimism about Ashcroft's assurances, saying he was not convinced that other Republicans would not challenge the outcome in court. ``That concern still exists,'' Wyche said. ``There still are rumblings out there that we hope are just rumblings.'' Republicans had considered a legal challenge, contending that the election of a dead man raised constitutional questions. Late Tuesday, some Republicans here also claimed that Democrats had been given an unfair advantage when polls in heavily Democratic St. Louis were kept open 45 minutes later than in the rest of the state. Circuit Judge Evelyn Baker ordered the voting extension on Tuesday night, saying a lack of voting booths and equipment had deprived some residents of the right to cast ballots. Baker ordered the polls to remain open an additional three hours, but a state appellate court overturned her ruling, and the polls were closed just before 8 p.m. Sen. Christopher S. Bond, R-Mo., said the extension amounted to voter fraud and had threatened to ask federal prosecutors to investigate. Baker had been appointed to the bench by Bond, when he was governor. But Ashcroft said Wednesday that he would not participate in any challenge, despite what he called ``serious allegations of fraud and corruption'' in St. Louis. Bond issued a similar statement. The race for the Senate seat in Missouri was one of the most hotly contested in the country and also the most bizarre. While on his way to a rally on Oct. 16, Carnahan, 66, was killed in a plance crash, along with his oldest son and a political adviser. It appeared then, even to Democrats who had hoped to regain control of the Senate and who were counting on a win in Missouri, that this race was over. But polls soon showed another surprising twist _ that the race was still up for grabs. Polls showed that even though he was dead, Carnahan was running neck and neck with his opponent. It was already too late to remove his name from the ballot, which meant that he was still running, even if in name only. Within days of Carnahan's death, it became apparent that Democrats hoped to revive the campaign with his widow as the most likely person to replace him. The new governor, Roger Wilson, announced that he would appoint Jean Carnahan to fill the seat should her husband win. After Carnahan's death, Ashcroft found his campaign in an awkward position, running against a dead man and essentially also against his widow. Rick Hardy, a political science professor at the University of Missouri in Columbia, said Ashcroft was overwhelmed by a campaign of ``emotion and symbolism.'' ``Carnahan was popular as a governor,'' Hardy said, ``and in death, he became much more popular.'' Still, Ashcroft said that he had no ``regrets about the way we handled things'' and that he hoped the election would be ``a matter of comfort for Mrs. Carnahan.'' Asked whether he would ever seek office again, Ashcroft replied, ``The last thing I want to do is think about running for public office again.''

The White House said Thursday ``the business of America goes on'' despite the election's uncertainty, and President Clinton will go overseas next week for farewell meetings with the leaders of Russia and China and a visit to communist Vietnam. ``There are no plans to cancel,'' said National Security Adviser Sandy Berger. ``Pack your bags.'' The post-election trip had been planned for months but came into question amid the agonizing suspense over who won the presidential race between Republican George W. Bush and Democrat Al Gore. Recounts and legal challenges could keep the outcome a mystery for days or weeks. Under the Constitution, Clinton must leave office Jan. 20. Clinton will be the first U.S. president to visit Vietnam since Richard M. Nixon in 1969. Saying the trip was on, Berger said, ``The business of the presidency goes on. The business of America goes on.'' The White House view was echoed by former Secretary of State Warren Christopher, sent to Florida by Gore to oversee the recount. ``Let me assure you that the presidency goes on until Jan. 20th in a vigorous way,'' Christopher said, ``and none of our allies are in any doubt as to who's in charge of the government until Jan. 20. There will be a new president then, but not before.'' The president leaves Sunday for a summit with more than 20 Asia-Pacific leaders in Brunei, an independent sultanate on the northwest coast of the island of Borneo in the South China Sea. He will stop off in Hawaii for a day and reach Brunei Wednesday evening after crossing the international dateline. On the sidelines of the summit, Clinton will see Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Jiang Zemin. The president also will meet with South Korean President Kim Dae-jung and Japanese Prime Yoshiro Mori. On Thursday evening, Clinton will fly to Vietnam for a three-day stay, visiting Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City, former known as Saigon. It will be the first visit ever to a unified Vietnam by an American president. It comes 25 years after U.S.-backed South Vietnam surrendered unconditionally to the forces of North Vietnam. The president will visit a MIA excavation site on a hillside rice paddy outside Hanoi on Saturday and take part in a ceremony marking the repatriation of the remains of several U.S. soldiers being sent to Hawaii for identification. Berger said there was ``full cooperation'' by Vietnam in trying to resolve MIA issues. ``We have not finished this job,'' he said. ``There remain roughly 2,000 unaccounted for.'' Clinton will be accompanied by his wife, Hillary, and their daughter, Chelsea. The president has invited officials of POW-MIA groups to join him. A group of American business leaders also will go to Vietnam. The White House said many members of Congress had expressed interest in going but might be held back by the lame-duck session of the House and Senate beginning next week. Clinton, an anti-war protester during his college years who struggled to avoid the draft, has undertaken a cautious rapprochement with Vietnam. In 1994 he lifted the trade embargo against Vietnam and the next year restored diplomatic relations. He reopened the U.S. Embassy in Hanoi in 1996 and in 1998 issued his first waiver of a law that bars trade relations with communist nations that deny citizens the right to emigrate. In July, after four years of negotiations, the United States and Vietnam reached a sweeping trade agreement allowing for generally unfettered commerce for the first time since the war. Berger said that ``Vietnam should be seen not only as a war but also as a country. We are not closing a chapter here. We're opening a new chapter in the relationship.''

Mr. Cohen will depart next Tuesday to visit Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, Oman, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Israel, Jordan and Egypt. The Pentagon says, the Secretary will consult with defense officials in those countries and also visit US troops in the area. US forces in the Gulf have been on high alert, since last month's apparent terrorist bombing of the USS Cole, which killed 17 sailors. An explosion struck the Cole, as it refueled in the Yemeni port of Aden.

Well for the ninth straight year, the United Nations General Assembly Thursday overwhelming approved a resolution condemning the American economic embargo against Cuba. VOA correspondent Breck Ardery reports from the United Nations. The vote was 155 in favor with only Israel, The Marshal Islands and the United States voting no. Four nations, El Salvador, Latvia, Morocco and Nicaragua formally abstained. 27 countries did not participate in the vote. The resolution calls on the United States to rescind the Helms-Burton Act, the law that outlines the terms of the US economic boycott against Cuba. Speaking through an English interpreter, Cuba's Foreign Minister Felipe Perez Roque told the Assembly, the US embargo is not the will of the majority of Americans. The press and overwhelming majority of people in the US and an ever increasing sector of Cuban-born community in the United States, business people and others are demanding an end to the blockade against Cuba. Mr. Peresruoke said a recent American initiative to allow the sale of food and medicine to Cuba, means little because it prohibits financing for such purchases. US representative James Cunningham said the economic embargo against Cuba is not a proper issue for the UN General Assembly. The decision of the United States to maintain a trade embargo against the government of Cuba is strictly a matter of bilateral trade policy and not a matter appropriate for consideration in or by the General Assembly. Mr. Cunningham said the trade embargo is one element of an overall US policy to promote democracy in Cuba. Breck Ardery, VOA News at the United Nations.

A suspect in the bombing of the destroyer Cole has told Yemeni authorities that the Islamic militants behind the attack tried to bomb another warship in January, but aborted the assault after their explosives-packed skiff foundered near the beach, government officials said on Thursday night. The account of the aborted attack came from a suspect being questioned by Yemeni authorities, who have shared the information with American investigators, the officials said. One official said it was impossible to verify the account, but said American investigators believed the suspect was providing credible information that was useful in the inquiry into the Cole attack on Oct. 12, which killed 17 U.S. sailors. In the account, first reported by ABC News on Thursday evening, the suspect said the suicide bombers originally planned their attack on an American warship refueling in the Yemeni port in Aden in January. ABC reported the attack was aimed at another destroyer, the Sullivans, which stopped in Yemen on Jan. 3. However, the officials said, it was not clear whether the Sullivans or another warship on a separate visit in January was the target. The aborted attack appears to have been part of a coordinated terrorist plot over the millennium holiday period, which included a separate attack that was foiled when Jordanian officials arrested 13 Islamic militants, the officials said. American authorities also foiled what they said was a terrorist attack when customs agents arrested an Algerian named Ahmed Ressam as he drove a car with explosives into the United States from Canada. American officials have said that those plots were coordinated by militants linked to Osama bin Laden, the Saudi exile accused of bombing the American Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998. If the suspect's account is confirmed, it would provide investigators with more evidence that the attack on the Cole is linked to bin Laden. Yemeni authorities have said they are holding several suspects in the attack, but so far they have been unwilling to allow agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation to participate in their questioning. American investigators said that getting direct access to the suspects, which has been the subject of intensive diplomatic negotiations, was crucial to the investigation. The officials said the suspect, who has not been identified by name, was providing much information into the attack on the Cole, suggesting it was the work of a large, highly coordinated group with significant financing and support from outside Yemen. ``They were planning this for well over a year,'' a senior administration official said. ``They had planned to do it earlier, but failed.'' (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) The officials said that the attempted attack in January had not been detected at the time and was impossible to verify independently. However, a government official said investigators were operating under the assumption the suspect's information was credible. ``I don't think we have any reason to doubt the information we have,'' the official said. If true, however, an earlier attack like the one against the Cole may have been narrowly averted by the bungling of the attackers. The suspect, in his account, said the two suicide bombers aborted the attack when their skiff began to sink, apparently because it was overloaded with explosives, the officials said. The senior administration official said that after the failed attempt, the militants retrieved the skiff and began refitting it with explosives for the bombing of the Cole. Some of those involved in the Cole attack _ it was not clear how many _ fled Yemen for a time only to return when planning resumed for the bombing last month, the official said. (END OPTIONAL TRIM) After the attack on the Cole, the Pentagon heightened the state of alert at U.S. bases throughout the region, fearing a new wave of coordinated attacks. In Kuwait on Thursday, the Interior Ministry announced that the authorities had arrested three people and seized a large amount of explosives in what they believed was a plot to attack U.S. troops in the country. In Washington, an administration official said those arrests appeared to be related to a specific terrorist threat that prompted the Pentagon to order troops in Kuwait to the highest level of alert called threat condition delta. The official said it was not clear whether the suspects in Kuwait were linked to those involved in attacking the Cole. The Cole left Yemen last Sunday carried aboard a Norwegian transport ship. The Navy announced today that it would not return to its home port in Norfolk, Va., but rather to Pascagoula, Miss., for repairs that are expected to cost $150 million.

The White House said Thursday ``the business of America goes on'' despite the election's uncertainty, and President Clinton will go overseas next week for farewell meetings with the leaders of Russia and China and a visit to communist Vietnam. ``There are no plans to cancel,'' said National Security Adviser Sandy Berger. ``Pack your bags.'' The postelection trip had been planned for months but came into question amid the agonizing suspense over who won the presidential race between Republican George W. Bush and Democrat Al Gore. Recounts and legal challenges could keep the outcome a mystery for days or weeks. ``This is not a constitutional crisis,'' presidential spokesman Jake Siewert said, trying to calm anxieties. ``The president will serve until Jan. 20 as the Constitution dictates.'' Clinton will be the first U.S. president to visit Vietnam since Richard M. Nixon in 1969. Saying the trip was on, Berger said, ``The business of the presidency goes on. The business of America goes on.'' The White House view was echoed by former Secretary of State Warren Christopher, sent to Florida by Gore to oversee the recount. ``Let me assure you that the presidency goes on until Jan. 20th in a vigorous way,'' Christopher said, ``and none of our allies are in any doubt as to who's in charge of the government until Jan. 20. There will be a new president then, but not before.'' The president leaves Sunday for a summit with more than 20 Asia-Pacific leaders in Brunei, an independent sultanate on the northwest coast of the island of Borneo in the South China Sea. He will stop off in Hawaii for a day and reach Brunei Tuesday evening after crossing the international dateline. On the sidelines of the summit, Clinton will see Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Jiang Zemin. The president also will meet with South Korean President Kim Dae-jung and Japanese Prime Yoshiro Mori. On Thursday evening, Clinton will fly to Vietnam for a three-day stay, visiting Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City, former known as Saigon. It will be the first visit ever to a unified Vietnam by an American president. It comes 25 years after U.S.-backed South Vietnam surrendered unconditionally to the forces of North Vietnam. The president will visit an MIA excavation site on a hillside rice paddy outside Hanoi on Saturday and take part in a ceremony marking the repatriation of the remains of several U.S. soldiers being sent to Hawaii for identification. Berger said there was ``full cooperation'' by Vietnam in trying to resolve MIA issues. ``We have not finished this job,'' he said. ``There remain roughly 2,000 unaccounted for.'' Clinton will be accompanied by his wife, Hillary, and their daughter, Chelsea. The president has invited officials of POW-MIA groups to join him. A group of American business leaders also will go to Vietnam. The White House said many members of Congress had expressed interest in going but might be held back by the lame-duck session of the House and Senate beginning next week. Clinton, an anti-war protester during his college years who struggled to avoid the draft, has undertaken a cautious rapprochement with Vietnam. In 1994 he lifted the trade embargo against Vietnam and the next year restored diplomatic relations. He reopened the U.S. Embassy in Hanoi in 1996 and in 1998 issued his first waiver of a law that bars trade relations with communist nations that deny citizens the right to emigrate. In July, after four years of negotiations, the United States and Vietnam reached a sweeping trade agreement allowing for generally unfettered commerce for the first time since the war. Berger said that ``Vietnam should be seen not only as a war but also as a country. We are not closing a chapter here. We're opening a new chapter in the relationship.''

The controversy over what caused the sinking of the Russian nuclear submarine Kursk bubbled to the surface again, with Russia's top soldier saying NATO was still a suspect and the alliance's military chief again denying any NATO involvement. Anatoly Kvashnin, chief of the Russian general staff, told reporters Thursday he had asked NATO military chiefs of staff to prove the alliance's claim that none of its submarines was responsible for the Kursk tragedy by allowing Russian experts to inspect NATO submarines. On Friday, the chief of NATO's Military Committee, Adm. Guido Venturoni, issued another in a long line of NATO denials, saying the alliance was not involved in the Kursk tragedy. He added that what the Russian general told reporters and what he actually said in the meeting with chiefs of staff were different. ``I was not there when Gen. Kvashnin spoke (to reporters) but I know exactly what he said in the meeting,'' the Italian admiral said. Venturoni said Kvashnin told NATO's top soldiers that Moscow still ``had doubts,'' and that those doubts could have been eliminated if the alliance had given a clear response when Russia first asked about its submarines in the area. Venturoni cited NATO Secretary-General Lord Robertson's letter to the Russian ambassador in Brussels shortly after the accident affirming that no NATO assets were involved in the Kursk incident. Russian President Vladimir Putin also received assurances from President Clinton, Venturoni said. He added: ``As a military man, as an admiral, as a naval officer ... if we speak of a submarine of 18,000 tons of weight, with a double hull ... that we say has suffered major damage or a kind of devastation by hitting some object ... I think that object would receive a similar extent of damage.'' Russian naval officials have insisted on lifting the submarine to determine what caused the Aug. 12 explosions aboard the Kursk. Russian and Norwegian divers have recovered 12 bodies so far and some of the ship's documents. Deputy Prime Minister Ilya Klebanov, who is leading the government commission investigating the disaster, said a dent filmed on the Kursk's hull during the recovery operation may be evidence of a collision with a foreign vessel. Venturoni, speaking to reporters after a two-day NATO chiefs of staff meeting in Brussels, said NATO itself has no submarines, only NATO members have submarines. ``NATO has already answered (the Russian queries) through the secretary-general,'' he said. ``It is not in my power nor in the power of the Military Committee to agree on an inspection on a submarine that belongs to a NATO nation, be it French or Dutch or whatever it is.''

Almost a year after efforts to launch new global trade talks collapsed in Seattle, U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky said Saturday that the World Trade Organization would likely agree on fresh negotiations by 2001. ``I would think well within the next year, yes,'' Barshefsky told The Associated Press in Singapore, just before she was to fly to Brunei, where Pacific Rim leaders, including President Clinton, will hold their annual summit this week. The disastrous WTO meeting in Seattle was a big blow for Barshefsky and the Clinton administration, with protesters battling police outside and trade ministers on the inside unable to agree on a formula for new trade liberalization talks. This week's Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum can do no more than urge new WTO talks, but Barshefsky expressed confidence the world's trade ministers can soon find enough common ground to make it happen. ``We, Europe and a number of the developing countries have been in the process of laying quite a bit of groundwork for it,'' Barshefsky said by telephone. ``And I think the question is not whether there will be a new round, but when. It's reasonable to presume that a new round will be inaugurated, certainly, within the next year.'' Barchevsky sounded more optimistic than others gathering here ahead of the APEC summit. Malaysia _ which believes the WTO still hasn't done enough to meet the concerns of developing countries _ has expressed skepticism that APEC will even call for WTO talks, given the deep divisions between rich and poor nations in the WTO. But Barshefsky said: ``Quite a bit of the resistance is moderating, and I think that without a new round we do risk the atomization of global trade, and that would be a disastrous result.'' At their summit, leaders from the 21 APEC nations are also expected to ask OPEC to boost oil output to bring down fuel bills in the consuming nations. Pacific Rim economies are projected to grow by 3.5 percent next year, but persistent high oil prices could slash those prospects by almost one-third, officials said Saturday. APEC economic ministers start their meetings Sunday, followed by the gathering of heads of state Wednesday and Thursday. APEC is a loose grouping of 21 economies with a goal of free trade between both sides of the Pacific Rim by 2020. The members are Canada, Chile, Mexico, Peru and the United States; China, Brunei, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, the Philippines, Russia, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam; and Australia, New Zealand and Papua New Guinea.

A train transporting skiers to a Austrian alpine resort caught on fire inside a mountain tunnel Saturday, trapping as many as 140 people, the mayor of a nearby town said. The train was reported to be around 600 yards inside the mountain. ``Some people have been rescued but we have no way of knowing if there is any more survivors,'' said Norbert Karlsboeck, mayor of Kaprun, a town some 50 miles south of Salzburg in the central Austrian Alps. A massive rescue operation was launched after the fire broke out at 9:30 a.m., with some 13 helicopters, teams of police, doctors and Red Cross workers all at the site, the mayor said. ``We do not know anything about the reason for the fire, only that it broke out on the train,'' Karlsboeck said. Police were calling on motorists to keep away from the area so as not to hinder rescue attempts.

At least 170 people were killed early Saturday morning above the Alpine village of Kaprun, near Salzburg, when the cable car they were taking to a glacier ski run stalled inside a mountain tunnel and burst into flames, the provincial governor said. Rescue workers accustomed to avalanches and other disasters said the bodies of those killed in Austria's most deadly Alpine disaster were so badly charred that it may take days to identify them. Six hours after the accident, The Associated Press reported, the leader of a ski group from an American military base in Germany said 23 of her group were unaccounted for, but it was not clear whether they were among those who died. As night fell, about 12 hours after fire mysteriously consumed the cable car crammed with skiers headed for the popular Kitzsteinhorn glacier above Kaprun, the number of dead remained unclear. Rescue workers were unable to work in the car, which was reduced to a charred hulk inside the long tunnel. The fear was that the cable supporting the funicular car may be so badly damaged that it might snap, sending the vehicle crashing back down the track. ``I did not realize the full extent of the catastrophe until two railway workers came directly from the tunnel and told us all they had found was the metal base of the train,'' Franz Schausberger, governor of Salzburg province, told Austria's state radio. It was also uncertain how many vacationers were in the single-carriage car, which can hold up 180 people. Schausberger said that only eight people had survived the blaze. But a hospital in a neighboring resort town, Zell am See, said that it had treated 18 survivors and that three of them had been discharged. A quaint village whose streets are lined with traditional stucco homes and wood chalets, Kaprun, 60 miles southwest of Salzburg, is a popular destination for weekend skiers, especially from Germany. Many of the victims were probably Germans, though the dangerous process of recovering and identifying the badly burned bodies has only begun. Among those missing more than six hours after the fire broke out were 23 Americans, including two children, from a ski club at the American military's Leighton Barracks in Wuerzburg, Germany, The Associated Press reported, quoting the trip leader, Debbie Bruce-Duncan. She said she and several others from the group had missed going up the mountain because they decided to go shopping on Saturday instead of skiing. Skiers and snowboarders turned up early in the season to test the towering slopes of the Kitzsteinhorn glacier, where the car was headed. The car, which travels on rail tracks but is pulled up by a thick cable, had progressed about 600 yards into the long mountain tunnel when the fire broke out Saturday around 9:30 a.m. local time. The entire railway is about two and a half miles long. There were conflicting reports about where the fire might have started, with some reporters on the scene saying it broke out in the back of the car and others claiming it started in a front compartment occupied by an attendant. The Austrian government announced an investigation into the cause of the fire. At least eight of the survivors, who were apparently Germans, broke windows in the back and climbed out. Among the dead were three people waiting in a passenger area outside the tunnel but connected to it who died of smoke inhalation, Schausberger said. The dead were ``certainly mainly young people, who perhaps decided early today on the spur of the moment to do some winter sports,'' Schausberger said. The blaze raged for more than three hours, the black smoke billowing out of the lower mouth of the tunnel on to a hillside thick with spruce, before being extinguished early in the afternoon. Reporters near the scene said fresh air sucked into the tunnel fed the flames, and a spokesman for the Salzburg state government told Reuters that ``the fire was drawn upward as if in a chimney.'' One witness, Christian Wakolbinger, said the smoke had affected even those skiers at a mountain station the top of the route, according to the Web site of the Austrian network ORF. Many of those victims were evacuated by helicopter to be treated for smoke inhalation, he said. In the bright sunshine of what had been a perfect day for skiing, police cars, ambulances and fire trucks clogged the road leading to the Kitzsteinhorn resort. Thirteen helicopters were also part of the firefighting and rescue operation, and more were on their way from nearby Bavaria. The Red Cross also brought together about 40 counselors to help the relatives of the dead. President Thomas Klestil of Austria, Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder of Germany and President Vladimir Putin of Russia were among those who conveyed condolences to the families of the victims. The Austrian government declared two days of national mourning. News of the accident ``fills me, like all German citizens, with great sadness,'' the German foreign minister, Joschka Fischer, said. The cause of the fire is unknown, and the fact that it occurred at all puzzled many of the authorities, who said the cars were supposed to have been fireproof. Moreover, the trolley did not have an engine or an on-board power source. The Kitzsteinhorn system was built in 1974 and is described as the world's first underground mountain railway. The system was given a full overhaul in 1994 and can transport about 1,500 people from the valley station to the summit in an hour. The Kaprun fire follows an accident last year in France, when a cable car ferrying employees to an observatory on Pic de Bure crashed, killing 20 people. Kaprun was touched by death this March as well. An avalanche swept down the mountain, killing 11 ski instructors and a snowboarder whose body was later found under 6 feet of snow. Saturday's was the third fatal tunnel fire in Europe in the last year and a half. A fire under Mont Blanc in March last year killed 39, and another in Salzburg province in the Tauern tunnel killed 12 people in May 1999.

Up to 170 people died Saturday after they were trapped in a burning cable car being pulled through an Austrian Alps tunnel. It is the second serious tunnel accident in the Austrian province of Salzburg in less than two years. Other serious tunnel accidents in recent years: _ May 29, 1999: Twelve people are killed in Salzburg's Tauern tunnel after a truck plows into the back of a car, setting off a chain of explosions. The ensuing blaze and smoke kill people trapped in cars and trying to escape on foot. _ March 24, 1999: Thirty-nine people die when fire breaks out inside the seven-mile Mont Blanc tunnel connecting France and Italy. The blaze burns for two days as firefighters try to reach cars and people trapped inside. _ Feb. 10, 1996: A car and a bus are trapped when a huge rock plunges from a mountainside and smashes through a tunnel roof on the Japanese island of Hokkaido. Twenty people are killed. _ Oct. 28, 1995: About 300 people die and some 200 others are injured when a fire breaks out on a train between two stations on the subway in Baku, Azerbaijan. Many of the victims die of carbon monoxide poisoning. _ Nov. 18, 1987: A fire at King's Cross subway station, the busiest station in London, kills 31 people and injures 80. _ Feb. 28, 1975: An accident attributed to driver error in the London underground station of Moorgate kills 43 people. Several hundred are injured. _ June 16, 1972: A tunnel collapses on a train in Vierzy in the Aisne region northeast of Paris, killing 108 people and injuring 111.

A cable car pulling skiers and snowboarders to an Alpine glacier resort caught fire deep inside a mountain tunnel Saturday, trapping passengers and killing about 170 people _ many of them children and teen-agers, the provincial governor said. Among those not located hours after the fire were 23 Americans. Their fate was not immediately clear. Salzburg Gov. Franz Schausberger told reporters in Salzburg that only eight people managed to save themselves from the burning car, which apparently was full to its capacity of about 180 people. Hospital officials said all eight survivors were German. ``Most of them were youths,'' Schausberger said of the victims in an interview with state television. ``Today is a day of mourning.'' The car, pulled by cable through a tunnel for most of the more than 3,200 yards up the Kitzsteinhorn mountain to the ski slopes, was reportedly stopped about 600 yards inside the tunnel. Rescuers were unable to reach the compartment where fire broke out at about 9:30 a.m. Reporters near the scene were told that fresh air sucked into the tunnel fed the flames, which apparently broke out in the front compartment occupied by a cable car attendant. The blaze ``spread at a raging speed _ like a fireplace,'' Schausberger said. State radio said the survivors managed to push out a rear window of the flaming compartment. With thousands enjoying late fall sunshine and balmy temperatures on the glacier slopes, it was unclear who was inside the compartment when it caught fire, leaving many with friends and relatives unaccounted for distraught. The area is popular not only with Europeans but Americans living in or visiting Europe. Among those missing more than six hours after the fire broke out were 23 Americans, including two children, from a ski club at the U.S. military's Leighton Barracks in Wuerzburg, Germany, said trip leader Debbie Bruce-Duncan. She said she and several others from the group missed going up the mountain because they had decided to go shopping Saturday instead of skiing. The cable car enters the mountainside after being hoisted up a steep ramp, supported by metal struts. State television said without attribution that the massive steel cable pulling the cars up the slope apparently snapped before the fire broke out. The blaze kept burning for more than three hours, sending smoke spewing out from the bottom of the tunnel, said Norbert Karlsboeck, the mayor of Kaprun, the town at the base of the track. It was extinguished by early afternoon. Among the dead were three people waiting in a passenger area outside the tunnel but connected to it, Schausberger said. They died of smoke inhalation. The tragedy appeared to be the most serious ever involving cable-driven ski transportation. In 1976, 42 people died after a cable snapped at the Italian ski resort of Cavalese. A massive rescue operation was mounted, with some 13 helicopters and teams of police and doctors working at the site, the mayor said. Helicopters also were making their way from neighboring Bavaria, in southern Germany, carrying firefighters with special equipment. The Red Cross assembled a team of 40 psychologists to help relatives of the dead. ``We do not know anything about the reason for the fire, only that it broke out on the train,'' Karlsboeck said. The Kitzsteinhorn resort, located about 60 miles south of Salzburg in the heart of the Austrian Alps, is a popular summer and early winter skiing area. The cable car system, built in 1974, was modernized six years ago to include two state-of-the-art cars and technology. It can transport some 1,500 people from the valley station to the summit each hour. The system has never before recorded an accident, said Hans Wallner, the director of the tourist region of Kaprun. Experts interviewed on television said the railway was supposed to be fireproof. Police were calling on motorists to keep away from the area so as not to hinder rescue attempts. Schausberger declared a day of mourning for Salzburg province, and the federal government did the same for the entire weekend.

About 170 people are dead after a fire broke out on a cable car in the Austrian Alps. Officials in the Salzburg region say many of the dead were children and teenagers. The fire spread rapidly through the cars as it passed through a three-km long tunnel. Eight people escaped the car, which was believed carrying a capacity load of about 180. Most of the victims were skiers traveling to Kitzsteinhorn Mountain, one of Austria's most popular resorts.

On The Line, a discussion of United States policy and contemporary issues. This week, Global warming - what we know. Here is your host, Robert Reily. Hello and welcome to On The Line. Most scientists agree that the temperature of the earth in its lower atmosphere is rising. Many believe that this global warming is caused in part by a build up in the atmosphere of heat trapping gases, primarily carbon dioxide. Some say that human energy consumption from the burning of fossil fuels in factories, power generators and cars is a primary ingredient of global warming and should be reduced if drastic changes in the earth's climate are to be averted. Others argue that the slight warming trend over the past century is well within the range of natural variation or even measurement error and the drastic curtailment of energy use is not necessary. Joining me today to discuss what is known about global warming are three experts. Rosena Berbaum is Associate Director for Environment in the office of Science and Technology policy in the White House. Joe Friday is the Director of the Board on Atmospheric Science and Climate at the National Research Council and former Director of the National Weather Service and Michael McCragen is Executive Director of the National Assessment Coordination office of the US Global Change Research program. Welcome to the program. Thank you. Thank you very much. Let's start Rosena Berbaum with what, let us say, is established with certitude in scientific circles concerning the facts of global warming. Well, I think there is absolutely no doubt that the atmospheric composition of carbon dioxide has changed by 30% since the pre-industrial era and that corresponds very well with the burning of carbon based fossil fuels, coal, oil and gas. The temperature of the planet over that same time frame has increased now about 0.8 degrees centigrade, corresponds very well to the increased radiative forcing that we've added. And we also are beginning to see some shifts in ecosystems that appear to be related to this shifting temperature pattern of the United States and the whole world. We are beginning to see an increase in total precipitation both in the United States and worldwide. This is very simply expected, if you heat up the planet, you increase both evaporation and then ultimately precipitation. So you end up getting more water coming down in some form somewhere; snow, rain whatever and so you've seen some people blame both snow and rain on global warming, which may at first seem counter intuitive, but in fact it's completely consistent with physics. Joe Friday do you agree with that? Is that the consensus? The National Research Council finished study in January of this last year, this year, which indicated that if I could quote one line out of it, "The surface warming is undoubtedly real". It's clear that the surface of the earth is warming. There is a great deal of natural variability and that's one of the things that causes some confusion when people look at just a snap shot in time and don't take a look at the entire picture and I think that's very important that we take a look at the entire picture. Rosena's analysis of the gas increase of greenhouse gases CO2 is correct, that is reasonably accurate, as far as the overall modeling activities are concerned and so we see that. But things happen when people are trying to look at exactly what's going on, for example we expect after two very warm winters across the United States that the northern portion of this country, of the States this time will return to normal. Now that's going to seem like all of a sudden it's getting very cold and as a matter of fact, a lot of people in the press have carried this as a disastrous cold snap. It's a return to "normal" and so the variability and the weather patterns that occur over periods of 3 to 5 to 10 years is what we perceive and we are taking a look at these. We need to be cognoscente of the overall pattern. We need to really take a serious look at the data and so forth, that's what we tried to do in the National Research Council when we came to the conclusion that the surface warming was undoubtedly real. It is real and do you concur with that Michael McCrakgen? I certainly do, we were dealing with one of the toughest scientific problems there is. We have only one earth and so we are doing an experiment on it. We are seeing that the composition of the atmosphere is changing. We know that's due to human activities, we see the world is warming. How do you know it's due to human activity? Well, there is a number of ways we can do that. One, we can look at historical records, geological records and see what the CO2 concentration was and for the past many thousands of years it's sort of been - it was varying along at a relatively level amount and then started climbing just at the start of the industrial revolution. We also can identify that it's human-induced carbon from fossil fuels because of the particular way in which the CO2 is composed. Most carbon atoms have sort of 12 atomic weight. There are some that are 14 and they sort of decay away in time. The CO2 that has been added to the atmosphere tends to be that fossil fuel, that old CO2. So we know it's human-induced. Okay. What about the critics of what you are saying, who don't deny by the way that the earth is warming, that the big increase in carbon dioxide in the atmosphere occurred before 1940 and therefore doesn't correspond to the really massive increase in the production of these greenhouse gases from the burning of fossil fuels? Is there any merit to their case? Let me still argue that the CO2 increase occurred mostly after the reaction of the state and... Yeah. There are a lot of different factors that can affect the climate. Carbon dioxide is one, sulfur aerosols that we put out, the white haze that forms in industrial areas is another, those are human-induced. There are also natural factors that affect the climate; volcanoes and solar radiation changes. When you start putting them all together, you start to get a coherent picture of what has happened during the 20th century. We unfortunately don't have real good records going back to the early part of the 20th century for what was happening with some of these aerosols and measurements around the world. But what it looks like as though we have a reasonably consistent picture, it's kind of like being willing to have a civil conviction in a trial, a propounder into the evidence even if you don't have it. So you are not going to allow ... Absolutely everything pinned down. Okay, what about the waiting of these various factors that Mr. McCrakgen just mentioned that can affect the climate in such dramatic ways like solar flaring, like eruptions of volcanoes or a rocky burning of oil wells. I ask that question to all of you. How much is the human factor contributing as against these other causes? There have been two very interesting studies that have come out this year that seem to say that the most you could attribute to solar forcing is about 25% of the pattern that you've been seeing and one of the exciting things about what Mike explained is that when we put together what we do know about volcanic forcings and the changes in the solar cycle and changes in aerosol output and changes in CO2, put them all together, you can far better approximate the temperature pattern that you've seen over the last century, thereby giving you a greater confidence in your models for future projections. Volcanic eruptions tend to cool the atmosphere because they put reflective compounds high in the atmosphere and that will tend to set aloud in about 2 or 3 years, so they are very short-term affects. And then of course there is the alminoes that Dr. Friday is so well known for and that can have sort of a 4 to 7 years cycle on temperature. The reason I asked the question is because if we're suppose to do something about global warming we have to know how important the part of it that we have some control over, is in the overall picture and how according to you, how much? Well, as Rosena pointed out, there are several factors about which we have no control, that do affect the temperature. The volcanic activity has forced fires to a certain extent because they also put particular matter into the atmosphere and when you have massive fires, you can cause some problems along those lines. Those are relatively short lived. The solar activity is something that we know relatively, predictably over a 22-year cycle, it rises and falls. aha. Relatively regularly and we can identify some component although the real scientific linkages have not fully been established so there is still, it's still more statistical correlations than it is direct correlations. Although there is a beginning to develop a theory now of how that might work but it's still in its developmental phase. The natural variations from the almineo can make great changes, that's what occurred recently with the very warm winters that we've had for the last couple or three years over the northern half of the Unites States and now that those signals are going away, we are returning more to normal, as I mentioned earlier. aha. The models are trying to explain all of this and there is criticism of the models in the fact that it continues, they continued to do various things to try to fit together the historical record. But in all honesty, they have done a pretty good job of fitting together the historical record now. There had been criticisms in the past. The interesting thing about the models is they don't all predict the same local results. That's because we don't understand all of the detailed local results yet, but they do. Every model predicts the general warming based on what we've seen. Okay. And I think that's an important factor. I just want to take a moment to remind our audience that this is On The Line, and this week we are discussing what we know about global warming with Rosena Berbaum from the White House office of Science and Technology, Joe Friday from the Board on Atmospheric Science and Climate and Michael McCrakgen from the National Assessment Coordination office. Let's turn to the controversy over whether this warming is a good or a bad thing. Some skeptics will agree with you that the globe is warming. They will be saying it's not particularly warming at a faster rate than it has in the past but then maybe there is a dispute about that, and then even if it is warming, Mr. McCrakgen so what? It's nice to have a warmer winter. Our first challenge is to figure out how much might it warm in the future and the range of estimates is from sort of 1 or 1.5 degree centigrade up to perhaps 4.5 or 5 degree centigrade or perhaps even higher. About half of that uncertainty is due to uncertainty about what - how the climate system works and we are trying to Joe Friday was talking about, how clouds will respond. The other half, and actually a growing portion, is due to the fact that we're not - it's very hard to predict what society will do over the next 100 years. How much fossil-based fuels will we use over a 100 years? If you imagine back to 1900, predicting after 2000 is a difficult challenge and what scientists have done is constructed a range of possible scenarios for energy use for population. They go out to the year 2100 and they get this very large range for what's going to happen, so if we don't have many emissions and the climate isn't very sensitive then you tend to have only one or two, or three degrees centigrade. If it is quite sensitive and you have a lot of emissions, it's 4, 5 or 6 degrees centigrade, that's a big difference. If you have a small affect, we might adapt reasonably well to it. If you have a large affect, you're going to have very significant consequences. What about that, Rosena Berbaum? Well, to put this in historical context, you know, the carbon dioxide is already higher as you said Mike, than it's been in 420,000 years. We're on a trajectory to take it to levels it hasn't been in 50 million years, long before our human ancestors appeared and after the dinosaurs disappeared. So we are changing things in the blink of an eye in sort of geologic time to levels that just haven't been seen. Now the temperature increases that Mike talked about between now and 2100 are already 4 to 10 times as fast as eco systems have had to react to in the past when we look at the palio records. So we look back in time at how the trees have marched across the continent and how fast the pollen grains have changed. So we are pushing the ecological systems at rates they haven't experienced since essentially humanity flowered. But some of the skeptics say this increase in carbon dioxide is going to help a lot of eco systems, that the forests are going to flourish, the crops are going to be grown at a higher rate of production, that you will be able to plant in areas of the country that you couldn't before. I think that that's absolutely right. There will be some positive benefits. Carbon dioxide, if nothing else is limiting, is a plant fertilizer and so you can expect that if water is available and I would argue water is really the lynchpin to climate change, because as we discussed earlier, you're going to change the total amount of it and the timing and variability of it will change, so you have more evaporation, more coming down, more coming down in erosive storms. So, yes, CO2 is a fertilizer you might get faster plant growth in both agriculture and forest for a while. But remember we've also erected all sorts of barriers to the normal migration of plants that may be trying to keep moving north with this changing climate, so whether or not plants can get to there ideal situation is unknown. How eco systems will change and reassort in time is unknown. I think really the devil is going to be in the details in terms of impacts. We have not yet studied for example how agricultural pests might change, so yes the crop might grow faster and better, but will the pests themselves go through more cycles, will they over winter if it doesn't get cold enough? In Alaska, we've had a massive outbreak of pine bark peel destroying three million acres and it appears it's because the winters are not cold enough now to kill them. And so we need to think a whole lot about these details that we have not yet studied, changing pest patterns, changing disease vectors for example. I think this is one of the reasons that it's very difficult to make an explicit statement and is part of the frustration that we have in the debate that's going on now. You will have extreme views on either side of the issue, make statements without any qualifications. You will not find someone who is well grounded in the science making those same kind of statements because the basic science has a fair degree of uncertainty to it. There are some things that we understand, but there is a lot of things that, as Rosena pointed out, we are just beginning to examine. We didn't even consider eco system response to the climate further ago than about a decade. We just started looking at that over the last 10 years or so and we are just scratching the surface of being able to really relate to that. So the uncertainties are there and the more we understand about the complexity of this, about this world that we are experimenting with, the more we realize how uncertain it is. There are some things we know. Number one, the surface is warming. Number two, it does appear that human beings are causing an expansion of greenhouse gases. We don't understand all the other interactions, but all of the models indicate that warming is going to occur. How it's going to be distributed and what we should do about it, is something that's a little uncertain yet. But there are going to be some winners and some losers. There are going to be winners and losers from what we understand at present times. Yeah. And part of agriculture may be winners, but part of the agriculture may be losers and we don't understand fully yet. Michael McCrakgen, if the science is uncertain in the way that Joe Friday just mentioned, is it appropriate for the nations of the world to gather, as they did in Kyoto and as they will very soon in The Hague, and come up with a program to address the human contribution to these greenhouse gases, in a way that we can know reliably is going to affect things favorably? Well, this issue of uncertainty is a critical one to make sure we're clear about. Indeed, scientists like to be very certain of something to understand all of the cause on mechanisms and be very certain before they say something. But realize that we have only one earth on which we live and we are doing this great experiment on it. And this experiment we're doing is basically irreversible. You can't sort of pull the CO2, all the CO2 out of the atmosphere. Once we put we put it there, it's going to be there for a rather extended period of time. And we're going to be changing the world in a direction that we don't know. Now it's true that fossil fuels provide tremendous benefit to society and you couldn't suddenly say, well I'm going to stop using all of them because our standard of living of the world would just collapse. But, on the other hand, we are changing the environment in an important way and the question is how much risk do you want to take with the environment? Scientists are going to get better and better information with it, but it's going to take a long time to do something about it. The Kyoto protocol that is much discussed and which people are finding challenging to may be implement at the present time, will have only a very minor effect on what will happen to the climate until you get out to 2100 and beyond. While it will have a minor affect on the climate, it could possibly have a major effect on both industrialized countries and the developing countries. Rosena Berbaum, you were in Kyoto, where you not, and you are going to The Hague. Yeah. Tell us what the US government position is on addressing the problem it's been presented with. Well, we believe that Kyoto is an appropriate first step. As Michael said, it's a first small step. And tell us what the step was? The step is for the developed countries of the world to reduce their emissions roughly five percent below 1990 levels in a time period of 2008 to 2012 and it would begin to slow the rate of growth of CO2 in the atmosphere. The hope is that as countries think innovatively with incentives about how to produce energy, cleaner and more efficiently, that we will be able to build an energy system for the world, for the developing countries too, that will be lower polluting, and many, many ancillary benefits to having more efficient energy use, whether it would be carbon based or non-carbon based. It's clear that we don't, that other countries like China do not want to be buried in the kind of acid rain that we are, sulfur is a byproduct of coal. We can think about producing energy more efficiently and reduce sulfur and hazardous air pollutants at the same time. So, any journey of a thousand steps has to start with one. Kyoto is that first step. And then what is the second step in The Hague? What's supposed to happen there? At The Hague, we are going to get as much agreement as we can to promote the ratification of the Kyoto protocol, so that all countries of the world will begin to participate in thinking through how to change these trajectories? There will be a number of very important issues discussed. One is how the clean development mechanism will operate, that's the way to begin to do projects with developing countries to help them reduce emissions, but also help them move forward; very important decisions to be made about whether or not terrestial sinks as they are called, or the use of carbon that's stored in soils and trees and below ground, can be counted towards different countries' targets. I'm afraid that that's all the time we have this week and I would like to thank our guests, Rosena Berbaum from the office of Science and Technology in the White House, Joe Friday from the Board on Atmospheric Science and Climate at the National Research Council and Michael McCrakgen from the National Assessment Coordination office of the US Global Change Research program, for joining me to discuss what we know about global warming. This is Robert Reily for On The Line.

Family members were anxiously awaiting the names of the dead Sunday, one day after flames engulfed a cable car traveling through an Alpine tunnel, killing about 170 skiers and snowboarders in the deadliest disaster of its kind. The identities of the victims, many of them children and teen-agers, remained mostly unknown early Sunday. Volunteers were compiling names of people who made it up the glacier slope on the cable car before the fire Saturday morning and who later returned to their accommodations. Among those still missing Sunday were six Americans, part of a group of mostly military personnel from Wuerzburg, Germany, and their dependents, said Maj. Drew Stathis, a member of the group. Stathis said a family of four was among the missing, including two children. Three U.S. army personnel were confirmed among the dead Sunday. ``It looks really grim,'' Stathis said. ``Last night we were told at about 11 o' clock that everyone was down from the mountain.'' The cable car had been filled to capacity with skiers and snowboarders, and the cause of the fire wasn't immediately clear. Nineteen people survived the disaster, including one person who was in serious condition with damage to the lungs. Officials said there was no chance of any more survivors. Toxic fumes in the tunnel had prevented workers from retrieving bodies, Salzburg governor Franz Schausberger said at a news conference Sunday. The identities of 85 victims had been determined with 90 percent certainty, he said. Most were Austrian, except for about 27 Germans, 10 Japanese and three U.S. army personnel. Most of the victims apparently managed to escape the compartment but were killed by fumes while trying to run up narrow stairs leading out the tunnel, Manfred Mueller, the head of cable car technical operations, told reporters. Those who survived apparently ran the opposite way, thus avoiding most of the smoke being blown upward through the tunnel by strong drafts. Authorities told reporters that fresh air sucked into the tunnel fed the flames, which apparently broke out in the front section occupied by a cable car attendant. The blaze ``spread at a raging speed _ like in a chimney,'' said Salzburg governor Schausberger. Speaking to the Austria Press Agency, an unidentified survivor said the crowd trapped inside the compartment ``screamed ... and tried desperately to find a way out.'' ``My only thought was to get out, and I could save myself in the last second because a window was kicked in and I could fight my way outside.'' It was possible the fire had started before the car entered the tunnel, Austria's public security chief Erik Buxbaum said Sunday. ``We have received information that the light of a fire was already visible to outside witnesses as the train was entering the tunnel,'' Buxbaum said. When the driver noticed the blaze it was already too late, Buxbaum said. Officials were working on a plan to salvage the bodies from the charred wreckage, Buxbaum said. Schausberger said a majority of those killed were ``undoubtedly young people.'' The Austrian government declared Saturday and Sunday national days of mourning. The Austria Press Agency described the disaster as the worst accident involving skiers transported by cable-pulled car to slopes. The death toll surpassed the number killed at the Italian ski resort of Cavalese in 1976, when 42 people died after a suspension cable snapped. Most officials have said that the cable car, pulled on rails underground for most of the more than 3,200 yards up the Kitzsteinhorn mountain to the glacier region, caught fire about 600 yards inside the mountain. The fire started in the morning, but rescuers were unable to reach the compartment where the fire broke out until after nightfall. Those who ventured inside said the car was burned down to the chassis. Schausberger said he was at a loss to explain what happened. Everything was fine when inspectors from the Transport Ministry checked the cable car system in September, he told reporters. The cable car caught fire at a time when thousands of people were enjoying late fall sunshine and balmy temperatures on the slopes in the heart of the Austrian Alps, on the opening day of the region's ski season. Built in 1974, the cable railway was one of the first of its kind with a tunnel passing through a mountainside.

grief engulfed as tree, a one day after a fire in a cable car filled can skiers killed at least 155 people. it happened inside a tunnel high in the austrian alps. here's nbc's ron allen. as helicopters carried emergency crews to the scene of the disaster nearly 100 americans headed home to military bases in germany, without eight members of their ski clubs who never came back. major drew stathis and his 8-year-old daughter say they might have been trapped, but they were just five minutes behind the group. in the army you kind of expect, prepare yourself. but not on a family vacation. that's where the tragedy is. lieutenant mike coe got tired of waiting for a train and left a family of four americans, who died standing in line. it is horrifying what happened to them. and it is horrifying how close i was to -- i mean, i guess i'm a good, impatient american who did not want to wait in line. today this alpine resort town came to an abrupt halt as more than 150 victims were all but positively identified. friends and relatives who'd been waiting and hoping were taken to a private memorial service. up the mountain the usually packed ski areas were completely deserted. investigators still haven't figured out what caused this disaster. several eyewitnesses have told them they saw flames coming from the train as it headed up the mountain, before it entered the tunnel. one official here said, by the time the driver noticed the fire, it already was too late. the main concern now is to remove and identify the victims. these americans ended a holiday weekend burdened by a deep sense of loss. nobody is looking forward to the long bus ride with our friends missing. it's going to be hard. hard for this entire nation mourning the worst disaster here that anyone can remember. ron allen, nbc news, kaprun, austria.

Relatives and friends who had waited through the night in this Alpine village began to get word Sunday on whether their loved ones were among the dead in a cable car fire that killed about 170 people in a mountain tunnel. With the village hall draped in black and candles burning on shop steps, shattered townsfolk gathered in the Kaprun church for Sunday Mass. As they mourned, emergency crews tried to reach the spot where scores of people, many children and teen-agers, were killed Saturday by smoke and flames. ``We understand Christ's wail on the cross: 'My God, why have you forsaken me?''' priest Peter Hofer said in his sermon. Others gave thanks after realizing their loved ones were safe. ``My son is, thank God, all right,'' said Gottfried Nindl. His boy had planned to go on the cable car with his friends, but didn't because they had slept too late, he said. The car, pulled on rails underground for most of the 3,200 yards up the Kitzsteinhorn mountain to a glacier region, stopped, blazing, about 600 yards inside a mountain tunnel Saturday morning. The cause of the fire has not been determined. Rescuers could not reach the victims as the fire raged on. Passengers tried to flee through the deep tunnel, but most were felled by the thick smoke and flames. Eighteen people survived, mainly by fleeing downwards in the tunnel where the smoke was thinner, authorities said. It was still unclear how many people were in the cable car, but it was believed that it had a capacity of 180 people and was full. The retrieval of the bodies was delayed by toxic fumes inside the tunnel and the need to secure the charred car. Chief firefighter Anton Brandauer said the tunnel was now almost smoke-free and that the retrieval of the bodies could begin. But as night rolled in, other officials said the accident site remained too dangerous, suggesting recovery efforts could be delayed until Monday. Once the remains of the victims are brought into town, authorities plan to set up a large tent in the town center where relatives and friends can say final farewells. Authorities said Sunday they had identified 155 of the victims with near certainty. Among them were 52 Austrians, 42 Germans, 10 Japanese, eight Americans, two Slovenes and a Croat. Authorities had not yet established the nationalities of the remaining 40 people. The victims were identified by eliminating those who had returned alive from a list of 2,500 people who had taken the cable car up the slope before the fire. Three U.S. army personnel were confirmed among the dead. The Americans were part of a group of mostly military personnel from Wuerzburg, Germany, and their families, said Maj. Drew Stathis, a member of the group. Stathis said missing Americans from the group included a family of four with two children, an engaged couple and a man and his son. As evening fell, the village of 3,100 was unusually quiet, with little of the usual ski-season bustle. The few locals on the street were outnumbered by the hundreds of police and rescue officials. Survivors described the horror of the tragedy. Psychiatrist Thomas Kamolz, who talked to survivors, said they told him of someone inside the car breaking a window with his ski pole and a survivor who ``saw a father throwing out his child'' in order to save the baby. Running on rails, the cable car enters the mountainside after being hoisted up a steep ramp over a valley, supported by metal struts. Erik Buxbaum, Austria's public security chief, said Saturday's fire may have started before the cable car disappeared into the mountainside. ``We have received information that the light of a fire was already visible to outside witnesses as the train was entering the tunnel,'' he said. Buxbaum said that when the car operator noticed the blaze, it was already too late. Other officials later said it appeared the fire broke out at the rear end of the cable car. Most of the victims apparently managed to escape the car but were killed by fumes while trying to run up narrow stairs leading out of the tunnel, said Manfred Mueller, the cable car's head technician. Those who survived apparently ran the opposite way, avoiding most of the smoke being blown upward through the tunnel by strong drafts. Bodies of victims were found as far as 60 yards upward from the charred car, investigating officials said. Salzburg Gov. Franz Schausberger said the bodies were found ``next to, in and under the train.'' Authorities said fresh air sucked into the tunnel fed the flames. The 18 survivors apparently included 12 who escaped from the car and six who had been waiting at the top of the tunnel. The Austrian government declared Saturday and Sunday national days of mourning. The Austria Press Agency described the disaster as the worst of any involving skiers being transported by cable-pulled cars to skiing slopes. The disaster's toll surpassed the number killed the Italian ski resort of Cavalese in 1976, when 42 people died after a cable carrying suspended cable cars snapped.

President Clinton leaves for East Asia today to attend the annual Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation Summit held this year in Brunei. The meeting of leaders from the 21 Pacific Rim countries is expected to be the last major international conference and last overseas trip for Mr. Clinton as a US President. Mr. Clinton will travel to Vietnam on Friday, making him the first US President to visit that country since the end of the Vietnam War in 1975. Analysts say the trip will help heal some of the long-standing wounds that still linger from the war. But as VOA's Stephanie Mann reports, there are still several difficult issues to be resolved. In addition to meeting officials in Hanoi and Ho Chi Min City, President Clinton is scheduled to preside over a ceremony for the repatriation of remains believed to be US servicemen listed as missing from the Vietnam War. Analysts say the President's visit formerly closes the door on a difficult period, stemming from the US involvement in the Vietnam War in the 1960s and 1970s. Gordon Flake is executive director of the Mansfield Center for Pacific Affairs, a Washington-based public policy institute. Having what I think in my perspective is an overdo visit of the US President to Vietnam, symbolizes that not only have we now signed a bilateral trade agreement, but that things are back to normal. The normal relationship between normal nation states that have normal interests, but that unfortunate era in the 60s and 70s is behind us. Asia analyst Douglas Paul says because Vietnam won the war, it has been easier for them to put the rancor of that period behind them. He says Americans had a harder time handling defeat and the lingering problems, such as identifying the servicemen listed as missing and dealing with the possibility of prisoners of war. The two countries established diplomatic relations five years ago. Gordon Flake says the President's trip has symbolic importance as a reward for the years of effort by Vietnam to meet US requirements for normalizing relations. Douglas Paul, President of the Asia Pacific Policy Center in Washington agrees the President's visit can be seen as a reward for Vietnam. But Mr. Paul says it will not make further improvements in relations much easier, as long as hard line communists remain in power in Hanoi. I don't think there's going to be a whole lot happening in Vietnam. Many corporate interests that had seen 60 million well-educated workers in the Vietnamese body politics have been disappointed because the communist party won't release its stranglehold on the energies of those people and continues to try to run enterprises in Vietnam. The United States and Vietnam signed a trade agreement in July aimed at reducing trade barriers and opening markets. Implementation of the agreement is awaiting US Congressional approval and action by Vietnam to put in place the necessary laws and regulations. Larry Worthsal, the director of Asian studies at the Heritage Foundation in Washington, says reform-minded officials in Vietnam want to push forward steps to implement trade liberalization. But he says the country's communist leaders see the trade reforms as contrary to the ideals of Vietnam's revolution. Mr. Worthsal says the President's trip may encourage pro-Western reformers, but he questions whether the trip is really justified at this time. I don't know why, at the close of the presidency, when there is so much reluctance in Vietnam to develop a legal framework, and they don't expect to develop a legal framework until 2006, what the urgency is for a visit right now. Mr. Worthsal says the United States can help Vietnam develop its legal system and can continue to help Vietnam with humanitarian issues. For example, he points to US efforts to help people still suffering from the effects of the defoliant agent Orange that was used during the war. Vietnam has repeatedly called on the United States to provide more aid to help deal with the consequences of the war. Foreign Minister Nguyen Dy Nien says the two countries are jointly researching the effects of agent Orange, but he says the Vietnamese people are still suffering and need more immediate help. News reports say during his visit, President Clinton is not likely to present any additional war-related aid. But he is expected to announce US funding to help Vietnam combat the spread of the HIV infection. Stephanie Mann, VOA News, Washington.

Hello, again from Washington, I'm Ray Krugell. President Clinton is meeting at this hour with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak. Mr. Barak follows Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat to the White House by three days. Mr. Clinton hopes to convince them to restore order in preparation for a resumption of peace talks. After his meeting last week, Mr. Arafat condemned what he called Israeli aggression against Palestinians, while insisting he is still committed to the peace process. But on Sunday at an Islamic summit meeting in the Gulf state of Qatar, he said the Palestinians' struggle will continue until Israel ends its occupation of Palestinian territories. Dale Gavlak has details on the Arafat speech. President Arafat told the Muslim leaders gathered in the Qatari capital Doha that Palestinians yearn for freedom from what he calls the claws of brutal Israeli occupation. He said that more than 200 Palestinians have died and more than 9,000 have been injured in nearly seven weeks of violent clashes with Israeli troops. He added that the Israeli closure of the Palestinian territories had cost Palestinians more than 900 million dollars. He said thousands have lost their jobs and that Israel has stopped transferring tax revenues from Palestinians to the Palestinian Authority. Leaders of the world's largest Muslim gathering in three years began their summit Sunday with calls for action against Israel for what they say are its war crimes against Palestinians. At the start of his speech, Iranian President Mohammad Khatami who heads the group, called Israel a terrorist race's sinuous regime. He said the Muslim world needs to do more to support the Palestinians in their struggle. Mr. Hatami did, however, refrain from repeating his plea Saturday to cut ties with Israel, although the summit's draft resolution does demand a severing of relations with the Jewish state. President Hatami also did not mention the United States by name in his address. Delegates to the 56-member Organization of the Islamic Conference said moderates led by Egypt and Turkey helped to tone down criticism of Washington. They also came up with compromise wording that kept anti-Israel rhetoric, but left members free to decide their future relations with the Jewish State. Qatar's Emir Sheik Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani told the gathering that there could be no peace in the Middle East without Israel's total withdrawal from Arab land, whether it be Palestinian, Syria, or Lebanon. He said Israel must chose between the possibility of living in peace in the Middle East or the continuation of this struggle for decades. United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan told the group not to promote violence and hatred during its three-day meeting in Doha. He said a way must be found to end the violence and killing. Mr. Annan added that peace cannot come about by encouraging violence and perpetuating mistrust. He urged the fostering of cooperation and dialogue between the two sides. Violent clashes sparked by a controversial visit by Israeli opposition leader Ariel Sharon to a Jerusalem holy site has brought the Middle East peace process to a standstill.

Austrian officials today begin the gruesome task of recovering the bodies of the estimated 155 people who died in a rail tunnel disaster in Austria's Alps. Previous efforts were called off because of intense heat and billowing smoke coming from the train, which was destroyed Saturday in a tunnel fire 100 kilometers South West of Salzburg. Stefan Boss reports from Budapest. As Austria started the day of national mourning after what is believed to be Europe's worst ever cable train disaster, hundreds of rescue workers prepared to recover bodies. Many of them had set out at first light to try to secure a damaged cable because of fears that it could snap and send the burnt out wreckage off the train hurling down a 3200 meter mountain 100 kilometers south west of the city of Salzburg. The Governor of Salzburg province Franz Schalsberger said Sunday, that at least 165 people were trapped in the train when it caught fire after entering a more than three kilometer tunnel on the way up to the Kitzsteinhorn glacier's T slopes. Twelve skiers, three more than earlier thought, escaped the inferno by smashing their way out of the train and climbing down hill to safety. Speaking through an interpreter, Governor Schalsberger also said it was unclear whether there was any one other than the missing driver aboard a second train, which was descending through the tunnel at the same time. Probably 165 people, but we have said the people in the car coming off the train, we have no idea how many people were in the car coming down that mountain. The train driver from the down coming car is still missing. Mr. Schalzberger said the dead included dozens of Austrians and Germans, as well as Japanese tourists and American soldiers from a military base in nearby Germany. He said earlier that the victims included children and teenagers who wanted to participate in snowboard and ski festivities on the top of the mountain. Stefan Boss for VOA News, Budapest.

Relatives and friends who had waited through the night in this Alpine village began to get word Sunday on whether their loved ones were among the dead in a cable car fire that killed about 170 people in a mountain tunnel. With the village hall draped in black and candles burning on shop steps, shattered townsfolk gathered in the Kaprun church for Sunday Mass. As they mourned, emergency crews tried to reach the spot where scores of people, many children and teen-agers, were killed Saturday by smoke and flames. ``We understand Christ's wail on the cross: 'My God, why have you forsaken me?''' priest Peter Hofer said in his sermon. Others gave thanks after realizing their loved ones were safe. ``My son is, thank God, all right,'' said Gottfried Nindl. His boy had planned to go on the cable car with his friends, but didn't because they had slept too late, he said. The car, pulled on rails underground for most of the 3,200 yards up the Kitzsteinhorn mountain to a glacier region, stopped, blazing, about 600 yards inside a mountain tunnel Saturday morning. The cause of the fire has not been determined. Rescuers could not reach the victims as the fire raged on. Passengers tried to flee through the deep tunnel, but most were felled by the thick smoke and flames. Eighteen people survived, mainly by fleeing downwards in the tunnel where the smoke was thinner, authorities said. It was still unclear how many people were in the cable car, but it was believed that it had a capacity of 180 people and was full. The retrieval of the bodies was delayed by toxic fumes inside the tunnel and the need to secure the charred car. Chief firefighter Anton Brandauer said the tunnel was now almost smoke-free and that the retrieval of the bodies could begin. But as night rolled in, other officials said the accident site remained too dangerous, suggesting recovery efforts could be delayed until Monday. Once the remains of the victims are brought into town, authorities plan to set up a large tent in the town center where relatives and friends can say final farewells. From there, authorities planned to take the bodies to Salzburg for forensic examination. Authorities said Sunday they had identified 155 of the victims with near certainty. Among them were 52 Austrians, 42 Germans, 10 Japanese, eight Americans, two Slovenes and a Croat. The victims were identified by eliminating those who had returned alive from a list of 2,500 people who had taken the cable car up the slope before the fire. Three U.S. army personnel were confirmed among the dead. The Americans were part of a group of mostly military personnel from Wuerzburg, Germany, and their families, said Maj. Drew Stathis, a member of the group. Stathis said missing Americans from the group included a family of four with two children, an engaged couple and a man and his son. As evening fell, the village of 3,100 was unusually quiet, with little of the usual ski-season bustle. The few locals on the street were outnumbered by the hundreds of police and rescue officials. Survivors described the horror of the tragedy. Psychiatrist Thomas Kamolz, who talked to survivors, said they told him of someone inside the car breaking a window with his ski pole and a survivor who ``saw a father throwing out his child'' in order to save the baby. Running on rails, the cable car enters the mountainside after being hoisted up a steep ramp over a valley, supported by metal struts. Erik Buxbaum, Austria's public security chief, said Saturday's fire may have started before the cable car disappeared into the mountainside. ``We have received information that the light of a fire was already visible to outside witnesses as the train was entering the tunnel,'' he said. Buxbaum said that when the car operator noticed the blaze, it was already too late. Other officials later said it appeared the fire broke out at the rear end of the cable car. Most of the victims apparently managed to escape the car but were killed by fumes while trying to run up narrow stairs leading out of the tunnel, said Manfred Mueller, the cable car's head technician. Those who survived apparently ran the opposite way, avoiding most of the smoke being blown upward through the tunnel by strong drafts. Bodies of victims were found as far as 60 yards upward from the charred car, investigating officials said. Salzburg Gov. Franz Schausberger said the bodies were found ``next to, in and under the train.'' Authorities said fresh air sucked into the tunnel fed the flames. The 18 survivors apparently included 12 who escaped from the car and six who had been waiting at the top of the tunnel. The Austrian government declared Saturday and Sunday national days of mourning. The Austria Press Agency described the disaster as the worst of any involving skiers being transported by cable-pulled cars to skiing slopes. The disaster's toll surpassed the number killed the Italian ski resort of Cavalese in 1976, when 42 people died after a cable carrying suspended cable cars snapped. The cable car caught fire while thousands of people were enjoying late fall sunshine and balmy temperatures on the glacier slopes on what was the opening day of the region's ski season. Built in 1974, the cable railway was one of the first of its kind with a tunnel passing through a mountainside.

Recovery teams on Monday removed the first bodies of at least 159 people killed after a cable car caught fire as it pulled them through a mountain tunnel toward their ski destination. The tunnel finally became free of smoke Sunday, more than a day after the fire that destroyed the Kitzsteinhorn cable car. Rescuers entered from the top end to avoid any risk of the car slipping downhill. What they found exposed them to what Salzburg provincial Gov. Franz Schausberger called ``a heavy psychological toll.'' ``It must be said that the salvage operation is extremely difficult,'' Schausberger told reporters. ``It also must be said that it won't be possible to identify the victims by traditional means.'' The cause of the fire remained unclear. ``We're investigating as far as the cause is concerned _ really in every direction,'' said Franz Lang, chief of Salzburg's criminal police. Authorities also were uncertain about the total number of people who boarded the cable car Saturday morning, but said the identities of 159 victims were near certain. Among them were 92 Austrians; 37 Germans; 10 Japanese; eight Americans; four Slovenes and two Dutch; one person from the Czech Republic and one person from Great Britain. Authorities had names but no nationalities for the remaining four people. It was believed that the car, with a capacity of 180 people, was full. Investigators reported that 29 bodies had been recovered and had begun to arrive in Salzburg to a morgue where forensics experts could do DNA tests. Lang said that large parts of the car had melted, making it difficult to separate the bodies from the car itself. ``We will need some time for this work,'' he said It is unclear how long DNA tests could take. Under the best of circumstances, such tests would take three to four days per person, Lang said. Many of the bodies are charred beyond recognition. Officials said 12 people saved themselves from the cable car after they broke its window with a ski. Six people who had been waiting at the top of the tunnel also survived. One of the survivors was in serious condition with damage to the lungs. The others were released from hospital Sunday. One survivor, Gerhard Hanetseder from the town Gallspach in Upper Austria, told state radio that smoke entered the cabin of the cable car soon after it began its ascent. After the car entered the tunnel, Hanneseder noticed the fire. ``Then panic spread. We tried desperately to get the doors open. The panic got ever worse. In the meantime the entire cabin was on fire,'' he said. ``By chance, a few of the passengers, using ski boots or ski poles or other implements tried to smash the Plexiglas windows. ``I saw in the last minute someone jump out and then I tried to grab my daughter, I gave her a push. And then I also somehow got out.'' Volunteers had drawn up lists with names of the approximately 2,500 people who had made it up to the glacier slope before the fire and who subsequently returned to their accommodations. Those missing were presumed killed by flames and acrid smoke inside the car or in the tunnel while trying to escape. Grieving townsfolk gathered in Kaprun's church for a Mass focusing on the tragedy. Later Sunday, Austrian Chancellor Wolfgang Schuessel and his deputy, Susanne Riess-Passer, joined relatives of the victims for a private memorial service at the site of the disaster, which remained sealed off. ``Sometimes we just have to live with our own powerlessness,'' Schuessel said later. ``We have an extremely high level of security and safety. But we can only do what is possible.'' Schausberger said that a majority of those killed were ``undoubtedly young people.'' Among the dead were German ski champion Sandra Schmitt and her parents, the Bavarian Interior Ministry said. Schmitt, a mogul skier, finished ninth at the 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano, Japan. Also among the dead were 32 people from the Upper Austrian city of Wels, including 13 municipal employees. Among the missing Americans was a family of four, including two children. Two others serving in the Army were also unaccounted for _ a couple who were engaged last week. The Austrian government declared Saturday and Sunday national days of mourning. A national memorial service is to be held Friday in Salzburg. Kaprun was quiet Sunday evening. The steps of many of its shops festooned with clusters of candles. The village hall was draped in black. Austrian flags were at half staff. The cable car, built in 1974, caught fire while thousands of people were enjoying late fall sunshine on the glacier slopes on what was the opening day of the region's ski season. The disaster was believed to be the worst involving skiers being transported by cable-pulled car to skiing slopes. The death toll surpassed the number killed the Italian ski resort of Cavalese in 1976, when 42 people died after a cable carrying suspended cable cars snapped.

A quarter century after the Vietnam War, America's search for 1,992 unaccounted-for servicemen goes on _ mostly in archaeological digs for bones and other remains, but also in efforts to run down rumors of live Americans left behind when the last known prisoners of war went home in 1973. As President Clinton will see this week when he becomes the first U.S. president to visit Vietnam since the war, the search for clues and closure is a complex, costly and painstakingly slow process that has taken U.S. investigators to the remotest reaches of Vietnam, as well as to neighboring Laos and Cambodia. ``We're not going to stop looking, as long as we have the leads to pursue,'' said Robert Jones, head of the Pentagon's POW/MIA office, which oversees the search for remains from Vietnam and other wars. Jones will be present when Clinton visits a rice paddy outside Hanoi, where it is believed Air Force Capt. Lawrence G. Evert, of Cody, Wyo., crashed in an F-105 fighter jet on Nov. 8, 1967. American forensics experts and anthropologists are working with Vietnamese to recover remains at the site. Evert is one of 1,992 Americans listed as unaccounted for from the Vietnam War. About one-third of the total are Air Force personnel, and about one-quarter of the total were lost in what used to be North Vietnam. Nearly 1,000 were in the former South Vietnam and the rest were in Cambodia, Laos or China. The Pentagon has stopped pursuing 646 of the 1,992 cases. The rest are considered open. Clinton's visit to the excavation site Saturday is meant to highlight the administration's commitment to accounting for as many war dead as possible and to thank the communist government for its cooperation. During Clinton's presidency, 283 missing servicemen have been accounted for _ nearly half the total accounted for since 1973, when U.S. troops completed their withdrawal and the last known POWs were sent home. The number of Vietnam War servicemen unaccounted for has dropped from 2,583 in 1973 to 1,991 today. Clinton also will hold talks with Vietnam's leaders and attend a ceremony in which remains recovered during a recent excavation will be repatriated and sent to an Army laboratory in Hawaii for identification. ``This visit is the culmination of a process that the president began with Vietnam eight years ago,'' Sandy Berger, the president's national security adviser, said last week. ``The cutting edge of that process from the very beginning has been, and remains today, achieving the fullest possible accounting of our POW-MIAs.'' The administration has been spending $5 million to $6 million a year on remains recovery operations in Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia, a portion of which pays for Vietnamese laborers who help sift through dirt and mud at long-abandoned crash sites in search of fragments of bone, clothing and aircraft debris. In one such excavation effort, similar to the one Clinton will visit, anthropologist Ann Bunch, of Medina, N.Y., and her team have dug an 18-foot-deep crater in the middle of a rice paddy about 55 miles from Hanoi, where an American F-105 fighter plunged from the sky 35 years ago. Wielding hoes and shovels, Bunch's team fills metal buckets with mounds of earth, which is washed through wood-framed sieves, occasionally revealing a sliver of metal or rubber_ a clue to a decades-old mystery. ``We find tiny pieces, but sometimes that's all we need to put the whole puzzle together,'' Bunch said in a recent interview. Jones, the Pentagon chief of POW-MIA affairs, said that although he sees no end in sight to remains recovery efforts in Southeast Asia, the Vietnamese government is reluctant to allow it to continue indefinitely. ``The Vietnamese are seeking an end-date to our operations,'' Jones said. During talks in Hanoi in August, Jones told Vietnamese officials that some in the United States believe that Vietnam is holding back remains of missing Americans, and he urged them to provide documents and other information that could finally settle what he called ``unresolved discrepancies.'' The Vietnamese reiterated their longstanding position: All recovered remains have been turned over to U.S. authorities. The most difficult issue _ both for the United States and Vietnam _ is also the most highly charged _ suspicion that Americans remained captive after the last known POWs returned home in 1973. Speculation and rumor about the ``last known alive'' _ Americans seen or heard by witnesses to have survived wartime crashes _ have been fed over the years by Hollywood movies and reported sightings of Caucasians in Indochina. A Senate select committee on POWs and MIAs concluded in 1993 that while there is no proof that an American POWs survived the war, the possibility could not be ruled out. Stony Beach, a Defense Intelligence Agency unit set up to pursue such reports, has found no hard evidence of Americans left behind, officials say, although the Pentagon is still working with Vietnamese authorities to resolve 29 remaining cases. As recently as August, during Jones' talks in Hanoi, senior Vietnamese government officials reaffirmed that no American prisoners were withheld, Jones said. ___ On the Net: Pentagon POW-MIA Office: http://www.dtic.mil/dpmo/ Vietnam search teams: http://www.usa.or.th/embassy/jtf-fa.htm Vietnam accounting: http://www.dtic.mil/dpmo/pmsea/statistical_reports.htm

Weeks after he disappeared when street protests forced him from power, Ivory Coast's former junta chief reappeared Monday and held talks with President Laurent Gbagbo, the one-time opposition leader who now holds power in the West African nation. After a surprise meeting with Gen. Robert Guei, Gbagbo said it was important that Ivory Coast ``find the way to reconciliation.'' He said he did not know what would happen to Guei, who was forced to flee following flawed Oct. 22 elections that ignited widespread protests. ``It's not for me to take such a decision. I am neither judge nor police officer,'' he said, adding: ``I hope that he returns home, that he regains his family.'' In a prepared statement, Guei said the meeting was ``based on the context of a search for peace and national reconciliation.'' But he said little of substance, other than to insist that he had ordered his soldiers not to fire on demonstrators during the protests last month. Witnesses have said they saw soldiers firing directly into unarmed crowds. After his disappearance, various reports put Guei in Liberia, Benin, rural Ivory Coast and France. Neither man commented Monday on Guei's recent whereabouts and it was unclear when the meeting had been arranged, and how long Guei had been in touch with Gbagbo's government. Guei refused to say whether he had retired from the army, though he urged ``his brothers in arms to put themselves at the disposition of their chief,'' an apparent reference to Gbagbo. The two men met on the estate of the late Ivory Coast leader, Felix Houphouet-Boigny, and held at least some of their talks in the presence of one of Houphouet-Boigny's sisters, said Freedom Neruda, a top adviser to Gbagbo. Though he died seven years ago, the memory of Houphouet-Boigny _ Ivory Coast's founding president and a longtime autocrat who led through more than 30 years of stable and relatively prosperous rule _ still casts a long shadow. Gbagbo, a longtime Houphouet-Boigny opponent, has had difficult relations with some politicians who consider themselves the former president's ideological followers. Monday's meeting may have been planned for Yamoussoukro, Houphouet-Boigny's home village and Ivory Coast's official capital, as a symbolic gesture to those politicians. Yamoussoukro is located about 150 miles south of Abidjan, the country's main city, where most of the government operates. Neruda said the talks were mediated by Mathieu Ekra, head of a reconciliation committee established after three days of clashes swept Abidjan and other cities, killing at least 200 people _ and perhaps twice that number. The clashes began Oct. 24 when Guei dissolved the commission overseeing the presidential elections and declared himself the winner _ despite early results indicating Gbagbo was in the lead. Furious, Gbagbo urged his followers into the streets. Guei was forced to flee once the security forces joined the massive protests. But protests continued, spearheaded by disgruntled opposition supporters who said their leader, Alassane Dramane Ouattara, was unfairly barred from contesting the election. Ouattara's party says at least 155 of its mostly northern Muslim supporters were killed and more than 300 injured as security force members joined Gbagbo supporters in sectarian attacks over the next few days. Ouattara's support comes mainly from ethnic groups in Ivory Coast's largely Muslim north while Gbagbo's base is among the country's southern Christians.

After two days of arguments that rekindled issues from the ``Battle in Seattle,'' Pacific Rim ministers called Monday for new global trade negotiations that acknowledge the goals of poor nations. The United States, Australia, Japan and others wanted to urge the World Trade Organization to start its next trade liberalization talks by 2001, but developing nations led by Malaysia refused to be rushed into the deadline, saying substance was more important than speed. Malaysia insisted on an agreed agenda before any negotiations begin, and the foreign and trade ministers from the 21 members of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum finally went along. Developing nations hope to avoid any inclusion of environmental protection or workers' rights that would hurt their ability to exploit their two main competitive edges: natural resources and cheap labor. ``We don't talk of compromise,'' Malaysian Trade and Industry Minister Rafidah Aziz said in an interview. ``We just talk sense.'' And although APEC can do no more than urge the WTO to start new talks aimed at dropping barriers to trade, even that limited goal proved difficult for the ministers. In the end, they struck a compromise, seeking an agreed agenda _ as demanded by the poor nations _ by 2001, the deadline the rich nations wanted. The WTO may traditionally have been a ``clubhouse for the wealthy nations,'' as Hong Kong Secretary of Commerce and Industry Chai Tak Hay put it Monday _ but ever since it famously failed to launch new trade talks last year in Seattle, rich countries have found it difficult to assert their control over the process. The disastrous Seattle talks were marred by rioting against economic globalization that has drawn thousands of activists to protest subsequent economic conferences. There have been no protests in Brunei, a tiny oil-rich nation in Southeast Asia run by an all-powerful sultan. But the same issues that killed the Seattle talks were being aired by the foreign and trade ministers _ and poor countries refused to be pushed around. Some of the ministers worried that setting a deadline for new trade talks and then missing it would be another major embarrassment. Despite the last-minute concession to poor nations _ which required at least two rewrites of a communique released late Monday by the APEC ministers _ some rich nations are still hoping President Clinton and other leaders can resurrect the call for new trade talks by 2001. Whatever APEC ends up saying, U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky has predicted the WTO talks will begin by next year, as some of the tensions slowly ease. APEC seeks free trade among developed Pacific Rim economies by 2010 and among developing economies by 2020. APEC economies represent more than half the world's output, but the trade grouping has been criticized as being too unwieldy and slow at meeting its voluntary goals. The group was founded in 1989, and Clinton was instrumental in setting up the annual meetings in 1993, allowing Pacific Rim leaders a chance to see each other face-to-face annually. APEC members are the United States, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, China, Australia, New Zealand, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Mexico, Papua New Guinea, Peru, the Philippines, Russia, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam.

Long after the work going on in county offices and courthouses in Florida is forgotten, the work going on at a conference in the Netherlands will have an impact on the entire world. Environmentalists and business leaders, scientists, and bureaucrats met in The Hague today to discuss how to stop global warming. Three years ago in Kyoto, Japan, a hundred and fifty countries agreed to cut emissions of greenhouse gases by an average of 5%. That's all well and good, but as The World's Carol Hills reports, now they have got to figure out how to comply with those targets. Proponents of the Kyoto Protocol see the United States as the country you can't live with and the country you can't live without. The reason is simple says William Mumor, who teaches environmental law at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University. The US produces something between 22 and 24 percent of all the greenhouse gases. So almost a quarter of the world's greenhouse gases come from the US with less then 5% of the population. So any effort to cut greenhouse gases must involve the world's largest producer. But the United States has refused to ratify the Kyoto Protocol. Congress strongly opposes it. So to try to entice American lawmakers the US team at The Hague is trying to promote the most flexible rules possible to meet the 5% reduction target. William Mumar says the Clinton administration favors low cost options like emissions trading. One option is called the 'Clean Development Mechanism'. Under the Clean Development Mechanism, the United States or an American company, or for that matter a British company, or a German company could build a wind turbine project in India, and India would get the benefit of the project. It will be paid for by the industrial country, but the industrial country would then get the carbon dioxide reduction credits for that project. Well, I mean, it sends the wrong signal. Chillaparthy Ramkrishna is Deputy Director of the Woodshole Research Center. What it says is that, well, we cannot reduce emissions in our own country but we are willing to pay you to reduce emissions in your countries and then claim credit for it. In other words, what it is saying is that emissions in the United States will continue to grow. Another area of contention, says William Mumar, are the so-called 'Carbon sinks', forests and farmlands that suck up carbon dioxide. If an industrial country pays to protect forests or to plant forests in a developing country, could they get credit for the amount of carbon dioxide that will be absorbed by that forest? And there are some countries that think that's a great idea and others that don't think it's a great idea. But Chillaparthy Ramkrishna says it is not the idea of carbon sinks that other countries object to. What they object to is claiming any reduction, or all reduction that the United States has agreed to undertake in the Kyoto Protocol through activities outside the country. David Sandlow, Assistant Secretary of State for Oceans Environment and Science is part of the US team at The Hague. He says some countries are misreading the US position. There is no question that the United States should and will reduce emissions here at home. That's an essential part of the solution of the problem and no one, especially the Clinton-Gore administration, is arguing that the United States should fail to reduce emissions here at home. On Saturday in an Internet broadcast, President Clinton addressed the issue of climate change and pledged to work vigorously to cut domestic pollution from power plants and negotiate a treaty that's both environmentally strong and cost effective. But the President won't be in office long enough to shepherd the policy through Congress. Europe is particularly adamant that the United States cut some of its own emissions, not just help others cut theirs. Burton Mets of the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment in the Netherlands says Europeans feel they have proved that energy efficiency is possible. Basically the energy prices have been higher and so there was a lot of incentive to be more efficient in terms of energy use. And so if you compare on a per capita basis, for instance, the emissions of greenhouse gases than Europe is significantly lower per capita than the US. But some climate change experts say The Hague meeting is more than just working for big countries, small country differences. They say its outcome may determine whether the Kyoto Protocol survives. Elaine Kloson is Director of the Q Center on global climate change. It's very important. It's the first meeting since Kyoto that will actually be a decision making meeting. It is also important because many countries want to go ahead and ratify it but can't really do so until some decisions are made at this meeting. Like another major decision Americans are awaiting, this one won't be made just yet. The meeting at The Hague concludes in two weeks. For The World, I am Carol Hills.

This is The World. I am Tony Kahn. Rescue workers in Austria have recovered the bodies of more than 40 victims of Saturday's train fire in a mountain tunnel. A spokesman for emergency services says the bodies were relatively easy to reach, but that it could take a week to recover all the dead. Austrian police now fear that a 159 people, including 8 Americans were killed in the blaze. The World's Jennifer Glass has details. What was supposed to be a pleasure trip has plunged the tiny Austrian town of Caproon into mourning. The train was only about a quarter of the way into the two mile long tunnel that runs up the mountainside, when its operator stopped it because of the fire. The train was at a steep angle, the tunnel acted like a chimney and the fire swept upwards. The smoke was so hot, so toxic, it killed three people on a station at the top of the mountain. Caproon police spokesman Hans Walner was shocked when he heard what happened. This train is running since more than 26 years now, and there wasn't any technical problem this time. So, from my opinion it was the safest way to get up to the mountain. It's much safer than a normal cable car because we are still on the ground. Personally, I did this trip several hundred times and never had the idea that something could happen. It is very unthinkable for something like this to happen on a mountain railway. That's why Mary Hues, Editor of Railway Gazette International says the train had no fire extinguishers or fire exits. I didn't think fire is considered to be a major problem at all. The main safety problem with a mountain railway of whatever kind, is to stop the train running way down the hill and causing a disaster by not having brakes working or something like that and the safety systems on mountain railways are geared principally for that. As a result of Saturday's fire, Austria has ordered five similar trains closed and France has ordered a safety review of its three mountain railways systems. Austrian officials hope to find clues to what caused the fire but it will all take time. Just identifying the bodies could take weeks. It will have to be done with DNA testing because most of the remains are charred beyond recognition. As always there were fateful and fatal decisions that determined who ended up on the train and who didn't. One British ski instructor was sitting on the train that preceded the one that caught fire. He gave up his seat and as it turned out his life, so that an older man could take the earlier train. And one American family intended to take that train to go skiing, but they overslept Saturday morning and missed it. Several of the friends they were travelling with were not so fortunate. For The World, I am Jennifer Glass.

In Austria investigators say the ski-train that caught fire Saturday apparently suffered technical problems before entering the tunnel in which as many as 160 people were killed. Stephan Boss reports. Survivors said they heard two explosions. Soon after, fire engulfed the train as it began its ascent over Kitzsteinhorn Mountain, about 100 kilometers Southwest of Salzburg. The Salzburg prosecutor's office has launched preliminary investigations into the disaster, ahead of possible criminal charges. Investigators say they have collected evidence that may prove the fire broke out well before the train entered the mountain tunnel. They also have raised questions about a condition of the railway and of the train on the day of the fire. Rescue teams were busy Tuesday trying to recover the remains of the estimated 160 victims. The chief of Salzburg's criminal police told reporters that parts of the train had melted making it difficult to remove the bodies, most of which were burnt beyond recognition.

Some may be taking a break from political uncertainties at home, but Pacific Rim leaders who met here Wednesday faced an array of economic problems _ high oil prices, the prospect of new world trade talks and the boom in e-commerce. Asia is well on the road to recovery from its economic crisis, but leaders must grapple with some difficulties and are seeking to push China's bid to enter the World Trade Organization. The 21 APEC economies, ranging from giants such as the United States and Japan to poorer partners like Peru and Vietnam, are expected to grow by 4.3 percent this year _ but economists warn that persistent high oil prices could cut those prospects. President Clinton and other leaders arrived Tuesday for the two-day Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit. As the conference opened Wednesday, the leaders held a series of one-on-one meetings to address various economic and geopolitical concerns. Japanese Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori met privately with South Korean President Kim Dae-jung and discussed their efforts to reach out to hard-line Communist North Korea and support the reclusive country's new willingness to establish relations with democratic countries. ``We agreed to maintain close cooperation to encourage North Korea for the development of relations with not only South Korea but also with Japan and the U.S.,'' Kim told The Associated Press after the meeting. Mori declined to comment. Prior to Wednesday's gathering, the leaders' economic and foreign ministers held two days of talks. Discussions in these talks likely centered on APEC's plans to urge the World Trade Organization to open a new round of global trade talks, following last year's disastrous meeting in Seattle where poor nations resisted efforts to include environmental protection and workers rights in any new negotiations. The Seattle talks collapsed with riots raging outside _ a scene since repeated at other global economic conferences. But it did not happen in Brunei, which made it known that antiglobalization activists are not welcome. U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky pushed to start new WTO talks by next year but could not convince Malaysia's Minister for International Trade and Industry Rafidah Aziz, who balked at setting a deadline and insisted on an agenda before any talks begin. Developing countries say putting the environment and labor standards into any new trade deal could destroy their main competitive advantages: cheap labor and the easy exploitation of natural resources. Thailand's deputy prime minister, Supachai Panitchpakdi, who becomes WTO head in 2002, sided with Rafidah on Tuesday. ``For the really controversial issues of non-trade items, like environment and labor, I would suggest we go around them very cautiously. I don't think we should have them in the negotiations,'' Supachai said. Barshefsky countered in a separate news conference that the next U.S. Congress would be unlikely to act on any trade deal that excludes the issues held dear by labor unions and environmentalists, who contend developing nations are competing unfairly when they pollute the environment and mistreat workers to produce goods at low cost. The APEC summit is the last for Clinton, who is credited with starting the annual sessions. After the summit, he will fly to Vietnam on an unprecedented mission to heal old war wounds. Clinton plans to meet privately with Chinese President Jiang Zemin, presumably to discuss Beijing's final steps toward entering the WTO. He will also talk with South Korean President Kim Dae-jung in a session sure to touch on communist North Korea's recent opening. Some leaders will be getting a temporary breather from domestic troubles: _Philippine President Joseph Estrada is fighting to stay in office after being impeached on charges he took illegal gambling kickbacks and siphoned off tobacco taxes. _Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori recently had to agree to step down next year because of a scandal involving his spy chief. _Indonesian President Abdurrahman Wahid's country remains locked in a battle to restore order in his chaotic country. Most of the APEC members are oil importers worried that crude oil prices that have topped $30 per barrel will hurt their economies. OPEC refused over the weekend to commit to any production increases that could bring prices lower, even hinting it may cut output early next year. Although the APEC ministers had a muted response, some officials suggested this issue would be left to the leaders. The explosive growth of e-commerce, with no clear rules for how it will be governed internationally, remains a key issue and one that Barshefsky predicted will be crucial for the WTO in coming years. The Pacific Rim economies are well positioned to cash in from the high-tech boom, but some poorer countries gripe that they are being left behind in a ``digital divide.'' APEC is a loose grouping, but its members are sticking with their goals of creating fair-and-free trade on both sides of the Pacific Rim, by 2010 for developed nations and by 2020 for developing nations. APEC members are Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Peru, the Philippines, Russia, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, the United States and Vietnam.

President Clinton, at a farewell summit in Asia, assured world leaders Wednesday that the United States is stable and unshaken by the election impasse at home. ``This has been a rather interesting week in the United States,'' he said. Clinton was meeting with 20 Pacific Rim leaders at the annual Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum. He also was talking on the sidelines with the leaders of Russia, China, Japan and South Korea. Around the world the U.S. election dispute, whose outcome hinges on the vote count in Florida, has confounded many people. The president talked lightheartedly about the election as he addressed business leaders. ``One of the things that I think we have learned is that we should all be very careful about making predictions about the future,'' the president said. ``I know I can safely predict this will be my last APEC summit. I just don't know who will be here next year.'' Asked what he would do after leaving the White House, Clinton noted the election of his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, to the Senate. ``Now I have a United States senator to support. I understand that's an expensive proposition,'' he joked. More seriously, Clinton said he wants to be ``a useful citizen of both my country and the world'' and pursue efforts to make the world a better place. However, he said he would ``do it in a way that does not get in the way of my successor. The United States can have only one president at a time,'' he said. But he added with a smile, ``I'll be around.'' In his remarks, Clinton stressed the importance of open markets and societies and called for the start of a new round of global trade talks next year. He said that both Gov. George W. Bush and Vice President Al Gore were committed to a more integrated global economy and expanded trade. ``On the question of leadership for trade,'' Clinton said, ``the world can rest easy because both our candidates made strong commitments to do that.'' In his meeting with leaders, Clinton was prepared to talk about the election. ``The president will express his confidence that this is proceeding under the rule of law and in conjunction with set procedures that exist at our state level and that it is democracy in action,'' National Security Council spokesman P.J. Crowley said. ``Meanwhile, our government remains open for business, and he is out here at APEC doing the country's business,'' Crowley said. The president was accompanied by his daughter, Chelsea, and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright as he arrived the opulent Empire Hotel to address business leaders. Clinton's visit to Brunei, an oil-rich sultanate in northern Borneo in the South China Sea, is the prelude to a visit to Vietnam, the first by an American president since 1969. On the sidelines, Clinton will meet privately with Russian President Vladimir Putin and South Korean President Kim Dae-jung on Wednesday. He will see Chinese President Jiang Zemin and Japanese Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori on Thursday. ``The president will be very much focusing on reinforcing the benefits of an open global economy'' as Asia begins to regain its footing from financial crisis, said Gene Sperling, director of the National Economic Council. When the leaders gathered in Malaysia two years ago, there was much to worry about. Indonesia had a minus-13 percent growth and South Korea had a minus-7 percent. But now, Sperling said, ``You look at dramatic turnarounds in most of these countries where now they are looking at their second year of positive growth.'' He said the United States would press its case for a moratorium on customs duties on Internet commerce. But the high point of the trip will be Clinton's visits to Hanoi, the capital of a unified Vietnam, and to Ho Chi Minh City, formerly Saigon. The trip beginning Thursday is the first ever to a unified Vietnam by an American president. It comes 25 years after U.S.-backed South Vietnam surrendered to North Vietnam, leaving in doubt the fate of many Americans classified as missing in action. Clinton said he hoped his trip would open ``a new page in our relationship with Vietnam. And hopefully one that will put an end to the divisions between the Vietnamese people and the American people'' and within the United States and Vietnam.

As a critical round of negotiations on a treaty to combat global warming entered its third day here on Wednesday, the U.S. Department of Energy issued a study that addresses one of the main points of contention, whether the United States could do more to reduce its addiction to fossil fuels. In the study, analysts for the Department of Energy say that fairly simple, inexpensive changes in American energy policies _ some of which have already been embraced by both presidential aspirants _ could go a long way toward cutting the country's emissions of carbon dioxide, the dominant heat-trapping greenhouse gas. The analysis concludes that energy use, and thus emissions of carbon dioxide, could be substantially reduced _ with almost no harm to the economy _ by raising standards for energy and fuel efficiency, increasing spending on government and private energy research and adopting a national trading scheme for carbon dioxide cuts that gives a financial incentive to companies to go beyond required reductions. The payoff would come not only in cutting the country's contribution to potentially harmful global warming, but also in lower energy bills, less dependence on imported oil and a reduction in emissions from power plants and cars that contribute to smog and acid rain, said a chief author, Dr. Marilyn A. Brown, the deputy director of the energy efficiency and renewable energy program of the Oak Ridge National Laboratory. ``There are lots of low-cost and no-cost opportunities that are a great investment,'' said Brown. She was planning to make a presentation about the work on Thursday for negotiators gathered here to debate the fine print of a proposed international treaty to curtail global warming, but word of the study was already rippling around the sprawling conference center on Wednesday, partly because it presented a contrast to the negotiating position of the American delegation. Under the treaty, the Kyoto Protocol, industrialized countries would cut their combined emissions of greenhouse gases by 2012 more than five percent below emissions measured in 1990. So far, more than 100 countries have signed the treaty, but no industrialized countries have ratified it. One complaint of many countries and environmental groups so far has been that the United States has strongly resisted committing to achieving a particular amount of gas reductions on its home turf. Instead, American negotiators have been pressing for industrialized countries to get unlimited credit toward emissions targets for investments made wherever in the world the biggest reductions can be found for the least cost. There has been growing pressure on the United States to commit to reductions at home. With four percent of the world's population, the United States produces nearly 25 percent of all the world's emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases. ``This shows us that there are huge opportunities to achieve real domestic pollution reductions,'' said Dr. Daniel A. Lashof, a senior scientist for the Natural Resources Defense Council, a private group based in New York City. ``It shows us there's no reason for the United States to demand loopholes as part of these negotiations.'' He added that momentum was building to push ahead with a core component of the Energy Department proposal: a national system for requiring cuts in carbon dioxide and allowing companies that go beyond those targets to sell the excess credits. This is the same kind of trading system that has sharply _ and without great cost _ lowered emissions of sulfur pollution from power plants over the last decade. At a news conference here on Wednesday, American negotiators said they were all for aggressively cutting greenhouse emissions domestically. But any treaty that forced countries to achieve most of their cuts at home ``would only increase costs, reduce incentives for innovation, and substantially complicate efforts to move forward,'' said David B. Sandalow, an assistant secretary of state for environmental affairs representing the United States. Some American environmental groups defended the American stance. ``I can't imagine the U.S. Congress sending huge amounts of money to Russia or elsewhere to buy emission reductions when there are cost-effective reductions at home,'' said Eileen Claussen, the president of the Pew Center on Climate Change, based in Washington. ``It only makes sense do those things first.''

This is the World. I am Tony Kahn. At an international meeting in Brunei today President Clinton assured foreign leaders that there is nothing to worry about in the overtime contest to choose his successor. Then Mr. Clinton addressed the conference of the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation Forum. His subject: globalization. You have felt both its great benefits and its temporary but brutal sting. On balance, the global economy and more open markets clearly have been a positive force in Asia and indeed around the world. Tomorrow President Clinton will fly to a country he intends to cite as an example of the positive force of more open markets, Vietnam. Vietnamese leaders hope globalization will reverse the country's high-tech brain drain to the west. The World's Odlone Cussin reports from Hanoi. Almost everyone seems to be studying English and many preparing for foreign university entrance exams. Almost 1,600 Vietnamese studied in the US in the 1998-99 school year, 31% increase from the year before and that number continues to grow. Bill Clinton will not ignore Vietnam's students during his visit. He will give a speech at Hanoi's National University, a speech that is expected to be broadcast live. Young people in Vietnam are especially needed in the so-called knowledge economy. In the offices of FPT, a fast growing Internet service provider in Hanoi, the average age of the 700 employees is a mere 26. FPT's deputy director Chu Than Ha, herself 26 years old, says anyone with the money to go abroad does. I think for young people in Vietnam now, we want to learn to get experience from foreign country as a student. If they have the tradition, for example ,if the parents have money to support them to go to other country like Australia, US , after that come back to Vietnam and to work. Others don't feel the urgency to leave though. 22-year-old Wen Tu Cha who works at FPT as an e-commerce developer says government restrictions on the Internet and news make her job more difficult. She says many of her classmates simply chose to leave, mostly for the United States. But Wen says she is staying, at least for now. Many, many of my friends think that we should go abroad and then stay there because they have more liberty, they have more facilities and equipments to develop yourself, but I don't think so. Maybe you think that working conditions in Vietnam is not as good as in the United States, but if you can improve it yourself you'd feel more happy. According to a government plan announced this year, Vietnam needs to have 25,000 software engineers by 2005, but there are only about 1,500 today. Could explain low government investment for the problem, the universities just don't get enough money to keep up-to-date on information technology. Indeed, that is precisely why Wen's friends are leaving. At another hi-tech company CMC Computers the benefits of going abroad appear clear. Ha The Minh is the director of the company, which has 250 employees and an annual growth of 40%. You cannot prevent it. They are going to west and may be the environment in the west is much better. They may stay there for a few years, let's say 5 years, 10 years and in the nice day they should come back and that people will be like the key leaders to create the new business in Vietnam. But Ha concedes he could only start his company because he first spent 3 years working in a Vietnamese government ministry. He says infrastructure and educational problems still plague Vietnam and not many of the young people who go abroad now are coming back. For the sake of his business Ha says he hopes President Clinton's visit and increased US investment in Vietnam will help change that soon. For The World this is Odlon Cussin in Hanoi. President Clinton's visit probably won't change Vietnam's economy as much as a bilateral trade pact will. David Dapist, chief economist for the Vietnam project at Harvard University's Kennedy school of government, says that once that agreement is ratified, it will rectify what the Vietnamese currently consider an unfair trade relationship. Right now it is legal to trade but on manufactured goods particularly the US imposes very high tariffs. The result of the bilateral trade agreement would be to treat Vietnam like every other country, including China and allow their goods to come in on an equal basis. And after the Congress approves the pact, trade between the two countries will increase both ways but especially Vietnam will find it much easier to export their manufactured goods. What is the symbolic significance of the President of the United States going to Vietnam in terms of the impact it really is going to have in continuing relations and trade relations between the US and Vietnam? Is he there just to show up or is he actually going to be able to do some business? I don't think he will do business in the normal sense of negotiating more things. That part has been done. I think it is symbolic in the sense that he is saying we would like to start a new chapter, that we are no longer trying to undermine the government, as many fear. President Clinton's visit will be successful if he can lay to rest some of those fears and let them realize that the development of their economy and society will occur not because we are planning or plotting it but simply because of the natural processes that all countries go through. Give us, if you can, just a quick kind of picture of the economy of Vietnam. Is Vietnam in a sense a unified country now? Economically, politically, does it have one basic set of problems or are they regional? The South is the economic powerhouse. The competitive industries, most of the exports, the rice bowl, the oil all come from the south. The North has the political power, it has rather inefficient, import substituting heavy industries that need tariff subsidies and so on. I think one reason that they are going so slow on reform is that the North is afraid that further reform would further strengthen the South, and that upsets the political balance, such as it is, and that is one of several things that they are nervous about. What about the Vietnamese themselves? What is it about them that you find especially impressive? Well, aside from the fact that they often win prizes in the Math Olympics, and that is not true of every country, I think one little story will get the idea across of just how much promise the country has. If you go down to Ho Ching Ming City you will find a kind of French pastry restaurant shop that is kind of upscale and the owner that I know had hired a French pastry chef trained in Paris and he made excellent pastries. And after 4 or 5 months he found a Vietnamese woman, he decided to marry, move back to France and made the announcement rather suddenly. My friend was at a loss for what to do until the guard who watched the shop at night went to him and said, I will do the pastries. He had been watching the guy at 3 in the morning when he came in and had learned himself how to make pastries and without missing a beat they were able to turn out excellent French pastries because the Vietnamese guard had learned on his own how to do what takes months or years of training in many other situations. The country has immense promise and if the rules are set so that people are allowed to work it would do very, very well. David Dapist is Chief Economist at the Vietnam program at Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government. Thanks again. Thank you. It has been a pleasure.

Philippine President Joseph Estrada is facing an impeachment trial, probably in early December. And today the similarities and differences between the way things are done there and here were on full display. Estrada's chief rival pointed out what she hopes, at least, is a similarity. Gloria Macapagal Arroyo today compared Estrada with former President Richard Nixon, who had to resign because of political pressure. Now here's a difference. Arohio ,who is leading the campaign for president Estrada to step down, is the Vice President. Philippine journalist Maritas Vitug is covering the story in Manila. Maritas, let me start first with a comparison to President Nixon. He was forced out, as we know, because of the Watergate Burglary scandal. What is the scandal facing Mr. Estrada? There are insider allegation that Estrada received almost 11 million dollars in illegal gambling money and tobacco taxes. The revelation came from his former gambling body and it's a bombshell, but it's only the latest in a series of scandals. Earlier on in his administration, he intervened on behalf of a friend involved in stock manipulation. So it's this practice of cronyism, of giving favors to friends that brought Estrada into a deep problem. And there are no friends apparently for Mr. Estrada in his own administration, to the extent of this that his Vice President is leading the charge against him. Here in the Philippines, the President and the Vice President don't need to belong to one political party, so the Vice President belongs to the opposition and she is leading the campaign for the President to resign. Does that mean that she will replace him? Yes, according to the constitution, if Estrada is impeached she becomes the successor. What about the constitution as regards impeachment? What rules the procedure of being drawn up in the Senate to do that? This is really unprecedented, they, the Senate went over the US rules of impeachment, and I think they will adopt most of them, except that here in the Philippines, the Senators would like the President to appear directly and they would like to ask questions directly. Unlike in the US, where I remember President Clinton was televised and questions were not asked directly from him. Here they want to make it different in that sense. Will impeachment conviction come by a vote of two-thirds? That's right. They would need about 15 votes to convict the President. But this is only the beginning, it's very hard to say how the vote will go at this point. There is a lot of street protests and yesterday there was a huge transport strike, there were rallies, stock brokers walked out of the trading floors, also a first in Philippines history. Maritas, is this taking you back a little bit to 1986 when some very powerful forces in Philippines society, 'people power' it was called, ousted then President Marcos. To a large extent, it's a dj Vu, except I see two differences today. First, the main Parliament, the Senate and the Congress are working together. It's like a converging of forces. And number two is the use of technology. Here in the Philippines the rallies, letters, the pressure, Congressmen and Senator they are all down to e-mail, on the cellular phone. It's faster now to organize demonstrations because of the use of cyber speed, which we didn't have in 1986. When Mr. Estrada was first elected into office, it was on the back of enormous popular support. He was sort of seen as the scrappy guy who faced down the powerful elite. Does he still command any support from among the poor and the people on the street? Oh yes, he does. He still has the support of the great unwashed, so called, but even this support has eroded, as shown in surveys, and he has lost the support of institutions like the Catholic church, the house of representatives, the big business and medium size community. Journalist Maritas Vitud speaking to us from Manila about the developing situation with the impeachment of President Estrada.

The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, Nov. 16: The last U.S. president to visit Vietnam was Richard Nixon, who traveled to the South Vietnamese capital of Saigon in 1969, at the height of a war that eventually took 58,000 American and 3 million Vietnamese lives. Thursday, Bill Clinton begins a three-day trip to Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City, as Saigon is now called. Clinton's visit is striking evidence of how far the two countries have moved beyond the rancor of that conflict. But if a healthy new relationship is to be built, Hanoi must ease bureaucratic restrictions on foreign investment and show greater respect for the civil and religious liberties of its people. Clinton's itinerary inevitably looks back to war-related issues, like repatriating the remains of Americans lost in action and helping remove land mines still buried in Vietnamese soil. But he should also use his visit to press for a faster pace of political and economic reform. Much has changed in Vietnam over the past three decades. Most of its 79 million people have been born since the war ended, and younger Vietnamese, in particular, look admiringly upon American prosperity and personal freedoms. While the Communist Party still jealously monopolizes government power and public political debate, ordinary Vietnamese are no longer afraid to talk about politics in private. But anyone who speaks out for more accountable government or wider freedom faces stern repression. Hanoi continues to jail open critics, persecute religious believers, censor newspapers, restrict the Internet and otherwise suppress dissent. It routinely violates provisions of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to which it acceded in 1982, guaranteeing freedom of expression, association and religious belief and prohibiting arbitrary detentions. After a disastrous decade of trying to impose North Vietnam's austere and repressive communism on the more freewheeling South, the country's leaders reversed course in the late 1980s and began encouraging Southern style entrepreneurship. But over the past three years, Vietnam's program of market liberalization has stalled as the country's political leaders have grown concerned about decentralizing economic power. Foreign investors have become frustrated with the Vietnam's bureaucratic hurdles and have taken their investments to China and other Southeast Asian nations. When Clinton talks to university students in Hanoi on Friday he should speak plainly about the merits of human rights, democracy, free markets and the rule of law, as he did during his 1998 trip to China. He also needs to raise these issues in his discussions with government and Communist Party leaders as well. Establishing firm legal protections for Vietnamese-Americans who want to return home to do business should be an important part of his agenda. He would also do well to follow the advice of Sen. John McCain and others and seek to expand legal exchange programs to cover press and human rights issues as well as commercial law.

The 14-year-old Mir space station will be ditched in February in a controlled descent that will send it hurtling into a remote area of the Pacific Ocean, officials decided Thursday. The decision to abandon the ailing space station was taken at a meeting of the Russian Cabinet. Officials have wrestled for months over what to do with the Mir, which Moscow can no longer afford to maintain. The Cabinet approved a plan to crash the Mir into the Pacific east of Australia sometime around February.

President Clinton has no intention of apologizing in Vietnam for the war he bitterly opposed, with his ambassador to Hanoi saying the United States has already transformed relations with its onetime enemy ``from pretty awful to pretty good.'' ``I don't necessarily think anyone is looking for an apology,'' Ambassador Pete Peterson said Wednesday on the eve of Clinton's visit to Vietnam, the first by a U.S. president since the fall of Saigon and the communist takeover in 1975. Clinton's anti-war youth probably is well known in Vietnam, Peterson said, but ``it's never mentioned to me and I doubt seriously if there will be any reference to it at all during his visit.'' Not officially, but Clinton's personal history as a war protestor and in avoiding the Vietnam draft are an unavoidable backdrop to his historic visit. He is the third president to go to Vietnam _ the first ever to Hanoi and the first to a unified Vietnam. Lyndon B. Johnson and Richard M. Nixon made swift, undisclosed visits to what was then a war zone to rally American troops. A former POW, Peterson said, ``I don't think there's very much postwar animosity'' in Vietnam. Eighty percent of Vietnamese are under 40 years old, he said, and the average youngster knows as much about the war ``as one of our high school students somewhere in America _ which is probably almost nothing.'' Before setting out Thursday, Clinton and Pacific Rim leaders closed the 21-nation summit of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum by calling for a new round of World Trade Organization talks next year. Clinton, who had played golf until 2 a.m. at a lighted course, also was talking separately with Japanese Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori and Chinese President Jiang Zemin. Following their golf game, Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong and Clinton announced on Thursday that they have agreed to start negotiations on a bilateral free trade agreement. Clinton took time to sign a resolution authorizing federal government spending to continue through Dec. 5, the day the 106th Congress expects to return to work. The legislation was brought to Brunei for Clinton's signature by a White House aide on a commercial airline flight. Two months before he leaves office, the president also held farewell talks Wednesday with Russian President Vladimir Putin and South Korean President Kim Dae-jung. Clinton said summit leaders were interested in the unsettled election for the White House. He told Putin and others ``there's nothing to worry about.'' With Putin at his side in the lobby of a lavish Brunei guest house, Clinton said, ``I think other leaders should have the same reaction the American people have. ``I think they're pretty relaxed about it and we'll let the process play out.'' Putin, through a translator, said Moscow is anxious but is respectfully awaiting the outcome. He said Clinton has led a breakthrough in U.S.-Russian relations, ``and we expect this torch to be given to whoever will be the successor.'' The United States showed little interest in a proposal by Putin for deeper cuts in strategic arms than current U.S.-Russia arms accords would provide. Putin's offer ``generally does not contain many new elements,'' a senior U.S. official said, but there are a ``few new twists'' which the administration will study. In Clinton's talks with Kim, the South Korean leader said he ``clearly sees value'' in a Clinton visit to North Korea, but that the United States must decide if such a trip was in its national interest. Wendy Sherman, a top State Department official, said Clinton would decide soon whether to make the historic trip. Earlier, there had been talk that Clinton would visit Pyongyang at the end of his Asia trip, but the White House scrapped it. The president will spend three days in Vietnam. He will speak to students at Hanoi National University and his speech will be broadcast live by Vietnam Television. Clinton will visit a rice paddy near Hanoi where searchers are looking for remains at a site where it is believed Air Force Capt. Lawrence G. Evert, of Cody, Wyo., crashed in an F-105 jet on Nov. 8, 1967. At a briefing Thursday, White House press secretary Jake Siewert said the United States has provided more than 400,000 pages of documentation to help locate Vietnamese and American soldiers missing in action. ``We're prepared to provide more documentation that could help narrow the search for some of those who are missing,'' Siewert said. Peterson, in a telephone briefing from Hanoi, told reporters accompanying Clinton that the president would see a communist Vietnam that has achieved significant progress in political reforms, economic conditions and human rights. He said human rights are ``not near where we want it to be.'' However, he said, ``We could condemn the entire police force of Philadelphia or Los Angeles or St. Louis or whatever for an act that gets captured on TV or in the print but that doesn't say that the whole police force is without compassion. That's just not accurate. And the same is true for Vietnam.'' En route to Asia, Clinton was asked if the United States owes Vietnam an apology for the war. ``No, I don't,'' he replied. Picking up on that sentiment, Peterson said, ``To be honest with you, I don't think an apology is nearly as important as a constructive engagement.'' Clinton has undertaken a cautious re-engagement with Vietnam. He lifted a trade embargo in 1994; the U.S. Embassy in Hanoi opened in 1996. And last July, after four years of negotiations, the United States and Vietnam reached agreement on allowing generally unfettered commerce for the first time since the war. ``We have moved the relationship from pretty awful to pretty good,'' Peterson said.

The 14-year-old Mir space station, once a symbol of Soviet space glory, will be ditched in February in a controlled descent that will send it hurtling into a remote area of the Pacific Ocean, Russia's Cabinet decided Thursday. The decision came after months of wrestling over what to do with the Mir, which Moscow can no longer afford to maintain. The Mir is by far history's longest-serving space station, and Russians have been reluctant to let it go. ``Nothing can last for eternity, even the Mir,'' Russian space agency chief Yuri Koptev told reporters, warning that it would be unsafe to keep the rattling, corroding Mir aloft in its current state. The Cabinet approved a plan to crash the Mir into the Pacific 900 to 1,200 miles east of Australia on Feb. 28-29. The move comes after attempts to find private investors to fund it failed, Koptev said. Officials here said Russia should concentrate its funds on the new international space station instead of the Mir _ something NASA has been urging for years. NASA is leading the 16-nation international project, which has suffered repeated delays because of funding problems for Russian modules. The Russian government had decided to abandon the Mir earlier this year but extended its lifetime after the private Netherlands-based MirCorp leased time on Mir and paid for its operation. MirCorp has pledged to raise more money to keep the station aloft, but the government has grown increasingly skeptical about the company's ability to do so. American businessman Dennis Tito, who had hoped to travel to the Mir as a ``space tourist'' under a deal with MirCorp and has spent $1 million in training, will not be sent to the station, Koptev said. The Mir was hailed as revolutionary when it went up in 1986, and has far surpassed the three to five years it was expected to last. But critics say it has also outlived its usefulness. The inside is scarred by a 1997 fire and one module, Spektr, is sealed off after a collision that year with a small craft ferrying away the station's garbage. Abandoning the Mir was an excruciating decision for the Russian space program, a force that put the first satellite in the cosmos, as well as the first man and first woman _ and now has no cash and no new projects entirely its own. Prime Minister Mikhail Kasyanov told Thursday's Cabinet meeting that he considers safely discarding the Mir an international commitment undertaken by the Russian government. ``One of our obligations is to ensure the safety of the final stage of the Mir's flight,'' he said. Koptev said an unmanned cargo ship would be sent to Mir in January, and in February the cargo ship would fire its rockets to push the station quickly into the atmosphere. In calling for careful preparation for deorbiting the Mir, Koptev on Wednesday recalled a Soviet satellite that crashed into northern Canada in 1978, in a major embarrassment for the Soviet leadership. Nobody was hurt but radioactive fragments were scattered over the wilderness. The unoccupied U.S. Skylab space station fell to Earth in 1979 when its orbit deteriorated faster than anticipated, scattering debris over western Australia. No one was hurt.

President Bill Clinton has become the first US President to visit Vietnam in 31 years. A small number of Vietnamese officials, including Foreign Minister Nguyen Dy Nien, greeted Mr. Clinton and his daughter Chelsea as they stepped off the plane at Hanoi. Although the official welcoming ceremony will not occur until Friday morning, thousands of Vietnamese gathered on the road from the airport and thousands more jammed a square in front of Mr. Clinton's hotel. The President will stay in Vietnam for three days, culminating a process of normalizing relations that began early in Mr. Clinton's first term in office, eight years ago.

Mexico's outgoing ruling party has threatened to boycott the inauguration of the country's first opposition President if officials refuse to recount the votes of an unresolved state election. Last Sunday's election for Governor in the Central State of Alisko, pitted a candidate from the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party or PRI against the candidate from President-elect Vicente Fox's Center Right National Action party. The PRI candidate was trailing the National Action candidate by about 36000 votes when the partial tallies were announced with three-quarters of the ballots counted. Electoral officials have said there were some irregularities but they have not authorized a recount.

Even as the legal battles continue in the United States over the outcome of the presidential election, an election dispute in Mexico is threatening to mar the upcoming inauguration of President-elect Vicente Fox. As VOA's Greg Flakus reports from Mexico City, a nasty battle has erupted between leaders of the current ruling party and Mr. Fox's National Action Party known as the 'Pawn'. Senators from the Institutional Revolutionary party known as the 'PRI' say they will not attend the December 1st inauguration of Vicente Fox because of what they see as a Pawn effort to steal an election. PRI leaders had demanded a hand recount of votes cast in Sunday's gubernatorial election in Halisco because of alleged irregularities. The State Electoral Commission, however, denied this request. Halisco is currently under a Pawn government and Pawn candidate Francisco Remirez Acunia was ahead in the vote by only 2% after 75% of votes were counted. Vote counting was frozen after some mistakes were uncovered and election officials now say a final count will not be known until this coming Sunday. PRI National President Duse Marian Saori has called for a boycott of the Fox inauguration unless the Pawn controlled government in Halisco allows the recount. The PRI senators backed her call on Thursday. Pawn leaders meantime, are asking the PRI leaders to reconsider their position. Pawn President Louis Feli Bevravomena says the PRI will pay a political cost if it carries out the threat to boycott the ceremony. He says that this will be a national Mexican festival and that the PRI leaders will only hurt themselves by not attending. Some political observers say there is some irony in this dispute since the PRI has so often been accused of election fraud in the past. The PRI has been in power in Mexico for 71 years and had not lost a presidential election until Vicente Fox won this year's July 2nd election. Greg Flakus, VOA News, Mexico City.

President Clinton is in Hanoi, the first US leader to visit Vietnam since it was unified in 1975 under communist rule at the end of the Vietnam War. VOA's David Gallust has details from the Vietnamese capital. It was nearly midnight by the time Mr. Clinton arrived here from Brunei and the APEC summit, but tens of thousands of Vietnamese turned out along the motorcade route to get a glimpse of Mr. Clinton, even though the Vietnamese government had given scant mention of the President's visit in the state media. There was a red carpet, but little ceremony at the airport. Mr. Clinton will be given an official welcome at mid-morning Friday and will hold talks immediately thereafter with Vietnamese President Chon Duglon. The visit climaxes a process of normalization and reconciliation between the former enemies that began in earnest after Mr. Clinton took office in 1993. Accounting for the nearly 2000 US servicemen still missing from the war remains at the top of the US agenda, but the visit is otherwise intended to be forward looking with the President hopeful the trade agreement the two sides signed in July will help move communist Vietnam toward a freer society and economy.

Thank you Dave, I'm Tony Riggs along with Robert Burns bringing you this hour of VOA News now. The discovery of notes written by sailors trapped inside the Kursk raised new questions about the delayed and ultimately failed rescue mission after the Russian submarine went down in the Barents Sea, killing all 118 crew members. Today's Dateline explores the human tragedy surrounding the submarine crew trapped beneath the sea. Here is Judith Latham. The mission to recover the remains of crewmen who died aboard the sunken nuclear submarine Kursk has uncovered a log book and two notes written by Russian submariners; notes that have helped provide public criticism over the military's slow response to the August 12th disaster. VOA correspondent Eve Connett in St. Petersburg spoke with parents of the victims and with other Russians about these notes and about how the revelations have affected their views of the Kremlin and its pledge to carry out an honest investigation into the national tragedy. In their small apartment in St. Petersberg, Roman and Erena Kalashnikov pour over photographs of their 27-year-old son Dimitre, one of the 12 sailors whose bodies were recovered from the Kursk submarine before the salvage operation was called off. Roman, who also served in the country's navy, pulls out a piece of paper on which he copied the last words his son wrote before his death. It is too dark to write it now, but I will try to do it blindly. It looks like there is no chance 10-20%. Here is a list of personnel who are in the 9th section and trying to get out. Hello to everyone. Don't despair. His son's note disproved the Russian government's claim that all sailors died immediately in the Kursk tragedy. The idea that the crewmen could not have been saved deflected criticism from the Kremlin that it had acted too slowly and ineffectively to save the 118 men from being buried alive on the bottom of the Barents Sea. But Roman Kalashnikov says that although his son's note proves the officials were wrong, he has become a firm supporter of President Vladimir Putin, the man he believes is spearheading an honest and open investigation into the Kursk tragedy. In Russia everything depends on what a President says. And I can say that the promises he made are being fulfilled flawlessly from a legal point of view. I think this investigation will be brought to fruition. The highly publicized expensive salvage mission, as well as the generous State support for the families of the Kursk victims, is unprecedented. Beres Kuluada, survivor of the Soviet Kumsomolitz nuclear submarine which sank in 1989, says the government's response then was fundamentally different from what Russians are witnessing now. He says there was no help for the relatives like we are seeing now. Those of us who lived through the sinking of the Kumsomolitz were told, "You should be thankful that you survived. You cannot ask for anything more". Dimitre Kalashnikov's mother Erena sees the release of her son's note and the government's apparent concern for her family as an effort to do right, to make up for callous behavior in the past. even bury people in secret. The widows never knew what happened or how. Ten years later they might receive some certificate, but in the case of the Kursk everything has been done with great openness. But others are not so sure openness is the right way to describe the government's reaction and say it is too early to herald in a new era of official honesty. Alexander Golds, Military Analyst for Etogee, a weekly news magazine, believes Dimitre Kalashnikov's note which contradicted statements of both the Northern Fleet and the Kremlin was only released because there was no way to stop its publication. There are few theories, unfortunately we can only speculate. It looks like that it happened because of a few circumstances. First the weather was so bad that they cannot immediately take what is from Norwegian ship Regalla through the coast to save her at risk. That's why they had to make first examination of the boarders on board of Regalla. Second, there were two people on Regalla, the man from general military prosecutor office and medical expert, both of them have not to report directly to fleet command. If they tried to hide this note it can came to the surface immediately only because it had happened on a foreign ship and there can be theoretically some witnesses. But now there is more that just Dimitre Kalashnikov note. Russia's Deputy Prime Minister Eliac Ivanov, in charge of the commission investigating the cause of the sinking of the Kursk, says a second note was recovered from a dead crewman, which reads, "We are getting weaker from the effects of carbon monoxide following the fire. Pressure is rising. If we get out we won't stand the compression". The sailor who wrote the note said he doubted the men would survive for more than 24 hours, information which supports the government in the sense that it proves rescue team would not have had enough time to save any of the 23 sailors slowly suffocating in the Kursk's 9th compartment. In whatever way information will be revealed the fact that at least some of the men survived for at least a few hours brought the tragedy back into peoples' hearts once again. While it was not the first time Russian sailors died at sea, it was the first time that such a disaster was so publicized and the government's response so critically monitored both worldwide and at home. VOA's Eve Connett reporting from St. Petersburg. Naval Analyst Norman Palmer is the author of more than 30 books, many of them on submarine warfare. Mr. Palmer says the Kursk was actually equipped with one of the most modern escape systems in the world, including a capsule that was capable of carrying the entire crew to the surface. But it was damaged or perhaps destroyed in the explosion. But beyond that the surviving crewmen in the rear end of the submarine should have been able to use their own individual escape devices to reach the surface. Separate from that, there are several methods of people on the outside world coming to the submarine and rescuing any survivors out of the submarine. But that requires a escape hatch or escape compartment in the submarine that is still useful and if the explosion may have severely damaged that capability also. But also you have to have the rescue equipment from a surface ship in the area rapidly within a day, two or at most three days. We don't know the full details of the Russian response, at least we don't in the West at this time. When you deal with the Russians and their Soviet progenitors, of course you are also dealing with the massive security issue where they would not want outside help because of features both outside and inside of the submarine they would not want foreign intelligence to have access to. Because the damage to the Kursk was far more serious than any one realized at the time, Mr. Palmer says, neither the crew's own escape capability nor the Russian navy's rescue capability was able to deal with the problem and ultimately the failed rescue turned into a public relations disaster. The recovery of letters written by the trapped Russian submariners has made the situation even more poignant. But remember in the old days, the Soviet regime would never have released those letters. Right. The letters would never been seen by the press or the families and I think you have a situation where post Cold War Russian public relations has not caught up with the real world. Naval Analyst Norman Palmer, author of many books on submarine warfare. 'The crew trapped beneath the sea' was the subject of today's Dateline. I'm Judith Latham.

Delegates at the United Nations global climate change meeting in The Hague this week are discussing means to reduce global carbon emissions as outlined in the 1997 Kyoto protocol. The climate agreement mandates industrial nations to reduce their emissions by 5% below 1990 levels between 2008 and 2012. One of the most controversial issues at The Hague, is a move by the United States, Japan, Australia and Canada to factor in so-called carbon sinks, the oceans, forest and other natural environments that absorb carbon from the atmosphere as a way of reaching emissions reduction targets. Jimmy Samiento at Princeton University's Atmospheric and Ocean Sciences Department says research shows there are uncertainties in this approach. We are going to have to do much more than just consider forest uptake if we want to bring down the carbon dioxide to levels that would not lead to such dramatic warming as predicated by models. One study predicts that as the temperature rises, forests are likely to emit more carbon dioxide leading to more global warming. A second study says planting trees will not lead to a greater reduction of carbon emissions as previously thought. Both reports are published in the journal Nature.

The European Union is boosting economic aid to its southern Mediterranean neighbors. Douglas Backchin reports, EU ministers and their Mediterranean counterparts discussed the matter at a two-day meeting in Marseilles, France. The so-called Euro-Med group brings together the European Union along with 12 mostly Arab partners and Israel. European institutions have pledged some 11 billion dollars to the Southern Mediterranean region through the year 2006. The EU has approved about four and half billion dollars in aid and the European Investment Bank has pledged the rest in loans. The European Commission spokesman for external affairs, Goda Weigen says steps are being taken to insure that the money is used efficiently. In Brussels we are streamlining the procedures in order to get early quick approval of member states on the country strategies to be pursued and not on individual projects. Secondly, we increase the number of staff available for this exercise considerably and we create an office of the commission, which will be called Europe Aid, very much like US Aid. Mr. Weigen says, there are also plans to strengthen EU offices in the countries of the Southern Mediterranean region to have aid programs implemented by people who know the area. In addition there is a new time pressure, the commission plans to set a three-year time limit for contracting every program after which the money will be halted. As part of its development strategy, the EU has already signed Association Accords with Tunisia, Israel, Morocco, Jordan and the Palestinian Authority. In addition, agreements with Algeria, Syria and Lebanon are also being negotiated. Talks have been concluded with Egypt, but no agreement has been signed. Cyprus, Malta and Turkey are also part of the program. Mr. Weigen speaking from Marseilles says the commission wants to have the accords running by 2005. The agreements would establish cooperation in trade and other matters, and this would lead the way to creating a Euro-Med free trade zone by 2010. We want to open our markets more. We want to have their markets opened more. We want to have more security for individual businessmen going across and investing in the countries with a huge potential market. Mr. Weigen says that by developing economically, the Southern Mediterranean region will be better able to advance socially and politically. In addition to trade with Europe, the EU seeks to promote trade among Southern Mediterranean nations. Right now Mr. Weigen says, only six percent of their trade is among themselves. He says they should take a lesson from Europe where a large share of the prosperity comes from a successful internal market. Douglas Backchen for VOA News, Luxembourg.

President Clinton stood Friday beneath a huge bust of the legendary Ho Chi Minh, architect of the communist victory over U.S.-backed forces 25 years ago, and said that he was ``looking forward to building toward the future'' with Vietnam, America's one-time enemy. In a red-carpet ceremony, Clinton became the first U.S. president to visit Hanoi, the capital once bombed by American warplanes. He was welcomed by a military band and honor guard in the courtyard of the French-built presidential palace on Ba Dinh Square near the mausoleum honoring the late leader reverently known as Uncle Ho. ``I'm glad to be here,'' said Clinton, who led anti-war protests as a young man and resisted the draft. ``I'm looking forward to building toward the future. It was very moving this morning, this welcoming ceremony.'' The president posed for pictures with Vietnamese President Tran Duc Luong in a palace meeting room, sitting under a larger-than-life stone bust of Ho. The president's wife, Hillary, and daughter, Chelsea, joined him. Crowds of curious onlookers, some of them waving, stood three and four deep on the streets as Clinton's motorcade rode to the palace. A military band played the national anthems of the United States and Vietnam as Clinton and Luong stood under a canopied platform in the warm morning sun. ``I know that you have come a long way to Vietnam,'' Luong told his American guest. ``I hope that you are not very tired after the long trip and I hope the weather is suitable to you. I wish you all the best during this trip. I hope this trip will be very interesting for both countries.'' Clinton thanked him and said, ``I've been very moved by the friendliness of the people on the streets. It is a very good omen.'' Luong also congratulated Mrs. Clinton on her election to the Senate. ``We are all very happy,'' he said. Vietnamese officials told Clinton they were prepared to sign an international labor convention aimed at banning the worst forms of child labor abuse, White House spokesman Jake Siewert said. Clinton and Luong also were witnessing the signing of a scientific and technology pact covering issues such as flood-control management, marine research control and disease prevention. Another agreement dealt with labor issues such as skills training, worker safety and working with the disabled. On a visit stirring painful memories back home of America's long and most unpopular war, Clinton promised ``to build a different future'' with its former enemy. After meeting with Luong, Clinton toured the Temple of Literature, a 1,000-year-old memorial to what was once an institution of higher learning. He walked out of the walled compound and began shaking hands, campaign style, with a crowd lined 10-people deep along a side street. He shopped in a crafts store and, before getting into his limousine to leave, marveled to a Secret Service agent: ``Look at the children.'' The Vietnamese government seemed accepting of Clinton's embrace. ``The Vietnamese people have built and developed relations with the U.S. that look forward to the future, not to repeat the painful pages of the war,'' said an editorial in Friday's state-run People's Army newspaper. Clinton arrived in the communist capital late Thursday, the first U.S. president ever in Hanoi, a city once bombed by American warplanes. Thousands and thousands of Vietnamese were on the streets at midnight for a glimpse of Clinton's limousine and jammed the square in front of his hotel. ``This only happens once in a thousand years,'' said homemaker Tran Thi Lan, 50. Reaching out to a generation of students born after the war, Clinton planned to speak at Hanoi National University to describe his vision for a new chapter in U.S.-Vietnamese relations. State-run television, in an unprecedented move, was to broadcast the address live. More than 50 U.S. corporations sent executives to Vietnam during Clinton's visit in hopes of gaining a foothold in what they believe is a vast untapped market of 78 million people. As a young man, Clinton ``opposed and despised'' the Vietnam War, organized protest marches and avoided the military draft. As commander in chief three decades later, Clinton acknowledged that ``A lot of people still bear the wounds of war'' in both countries. The war cost 58,000 American lives and tore the nation with suffering and turmoil. The U.S. military buildup began in 1961, growing to 60,000 combat troops within four years and to 543,000 by 1969. U.S. forces in 1973 made a humiliating withdrawal that still haunts the Pentagon. North Vietnam's army captured Saigon in 1975, leading to the unification of the country under communist control. The losses to the Vietnamese people were staggering: 3 million dead and thousands missing. ``The best thing that we can do to honor the sacrifice and service of those who believed on both sides that what they were doing is right, is to find a way to build a different future, and that's what we're trying to do,'' Clinton said in an interview with The Associated Press. In a cautious rapprochement, Clinton lifted a trade embargo against Vietnam in 1994 and the next year restored diplomatic relations. He opened the U.S. Embassy in Hanoi in 1996 and in 1998 issued his first waiver of a law that bars trade relations with communist nations that deny citizens the right to emigrate. In July, the United States and Vietnam signed a sweeping trade agreement. ``I think it's a new chapter,'' Clinton said. ``The thing that makes America work over time is our ability to visualize new futures and achieve them.'' Even as Washington and Hanoi look to the future, the United States still searches for missing servicemen and pursues rumors of Americans left behind when the last known POWs went home. Clinton said that ``so far all the rumors and all the leads have turned up dead ends.'' The United States lists 1,992 Americans unaccounted for from the war. The Pentagon has stopped pursuing 646 of the cases, and the rest remain open. Clinton on Saturday will go to a rice paddy outside Hanoi where experts are trying to recover remains at a site where it is believed Air Force Capt. Lawrence G. Evert, of Cody, Wyo., crashed in an F-105 jet on Nov. 8, 1967. Clinton is the third U.S. president to visit Vietnam. Lyndon B. Johnson went to Vietnam twice as president and Richard M. Nixon once, in 1969. --- On the Net: CIA World Factbook http://www.odci.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/vm.html

Vietnam Airlines signed a letter of intent Friday to purchase three 777-200 ER aircraft from Seattle-based Boeing Co., one of several U.S. deals made in connection with President Clinton's visit. Ray Bracy, vice president of Boeing's commercial airplanes group, said the sale likely will be worth around $480 million. He said he expects the national carrier to take delivery of the aircraft by the end of 2002 or in 2003. Bracy said Friday's letter of intent is ``not a binding contract,'' but ``a clear indication to move in that direction.'' Bracy added that Vietnam Airlines has ``shown real commitment'' to buy the three aircraft, which he said will be used to fly nonstop between Hanoi and Paris. The aircraft may also be used to fly directly between Vietnam and the United States when the two countries sign a civil aviation agreement, the subject of protracted negotiations. Separately, the U.S. Trade and Development Agency signed an agreement granting Vietnam Airlines $475,000 to help the national carrier develop information technology-related services. In ceremonies tied to Clinton's visit, memorandums of understanding also were signed by Oracle Corp.; V-Trac Holdings, a unit of Caterpillar Inc.; and Corning International Corp.

An explosion in the Saudi capital Friday afternoon killed two people, believed to be Americans, sources said. The Saudi sources said two people were killed when a bomb was tossed into their car window. The sources declined to be identified further. At the U.S. Embassy, spokesman Rick Roberts confirmed that there had been an explosion in the center of the city but said he had no information about what happened and was unsure whether Americans were involved. A Pakistani construction worker said the blast came at about 1 p.m. local time, right after Friday prayers. The man, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said he saw an explosion in a four-wheel-drive vehicle. He said he saw two people who ``appeared to be Westerners'' and that one of the bodies had been cut in half by the blast. Security officials initially closed off two main thoroughfares in the commercial district where the blast took place and police were keeping people well away from the scene. Within a few hours, the streets were cleared and reopened and rain was rinsing the blood away. The attack comes a month after suspected suicide bombers blew a hole in the side of the USS Cole, killing 17 American sailors as the ship refueled in Aden, Yemen, another Persian Gulf country. U.S. investigators have said the Oct. 12 attack on the Cole bears the earmarks of followers of Osama bin Laden, the exiled Saudi millionaire who officials say ordered the deadly 1998 bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. Bin Laden is hiding out in Afghanistan as the guest of its Islamic rulers, the Taliban. On June 25, 1996, a truck bomb exploded outside the Khobar Towers housing complex near Dharan, Saudi Arabia, killing 19 U.S. Air Force personnel and injuring more than 500 Americans and Saudis. The previous year, on Nov. 13, a car bomb blew up at a U.S. military headquarters in Riyadh, killing five Americans.

An explosion in a possibly booby-trapped vehicle killed a British man and injured his wife in the Saudi capital on Friday afternoon. In a statement, Riyadh Police Chief Abdullah al-Shahrani said the couple were British and that their car, suspected to be booby-trapped, exploded while the husband was driving it at 1:23 p.m. The man died from his injuries and his wife, slightly injured, was treated and released from King Faisal Hospital, he said. In a statement from the British Embassy in Saudi Arabia, Consul Ian Wilson confirmed that the man had died. He said the couple were British civilians, but he declined to give their names or provide any other information about them. Britain's Press Association said both victims were in their 40s and had lived for eight years in Saudi Arabia, where the husband worked for a private company. The police chief's statement came after conflicting accounts of what had happened. Saudi sources initially said two people, believed to be Americans, were killed when an explosive device was thrown into their vehicle. But at the U.S. Embassy, spokesman Rick Roberts said Saudi authorities told the embassy no Americans were involved. The explosion, in a central Riyadh commercial district of two- and three-story buildings, happened in front of a barbershop, just down the street from a supermarket and a pharmacy. Many such businesses are closed on Fridays, the Muslim holy day, and all would have been closed at the time of the blast, which occurred just after midday prayers. None of the stores' windows was broken _ an indication that the blast was not very powerful. A Pakistani construction worker, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said he saw an explosion go off in a four-wheel-drive vehicle. He said he saw two people who ``appeared to be Westerners'' and that one of them had been cut in half by the blast. Another witness, a cook who refused to give his name, said he saw a blond-haired man removed from a GMC vehicle whose leg was nearly severed and a woman who did not appear severely injured. Security officials initially closed off two main thoroughfares in the commercial district, where the blast took place. Within a few hours, the streets were cleared and rain rinsed away the blood. The blast comes a month after suspected suicide bombers blew a hole in the side of the USS Cole, killing 17 American sailors as the ship refueled in Aden, Yemen, another Persian Gulf country. U.S. investigators have said the Oct. 12 attack on the Cole bears the earmarks of followers of Osama bin Laden, the exiled Saudi millionaire who officials say ordered the deadly 1998 bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.

In a historic speech, President Clinton has addressed the people of Vietnam, urging them to work with Americans to heal the wounds of war. The President also spoke of the staggering sacrifice of the 3 million Vietnamese soldiers and civilians who died during the conflict. Let us continue to help each other heal the wounds of war, not by forgetting the bravery shown and the tragedy suffered by all sides, but by embracing the spirit of reconciliation and the courage to build better tomorrows for our children. President Clinton also raised the issue of human rights but went on to stress the US was not trying to impose its own ideals. You have already shown the world he said that Vietnam takes it's own decisions

President Clinton continues his landmark trip to Vietnam Saturday, with a visit to Ho Chi Minh City, know as Saigon, when it was the capital of US backed South Vietnam. The Associated Press says residents of the city renamed after the communists takeover in 1975, were showered on the eve of the Clinton visit with pro-democracy pamphlets dropped by air. They were apparently delivered by a one-time South Vietnamese Airforce pilot, who managed to buzz the city undetected in a small plane. Mr. Clinton said in Hanoi Friday, the shared suffering of war has given Americans and Vietnamese a relationship like no other. He also met with Vietnamese leaders who said they have a different interpretation of human rights.

With their dispute over investigative procedures receding, Yemenis and the FBI have made so much progress probing the attack on the USS Cole that the bureau is bringing home more agents and its on-scene commander, a senior FBI official said Friday. The announcement by Assistant FBI Director Dale Watson, head of the bureau's counterterrorism division, did not detail that progress. However, Yemeni Prime Minister Abdul-Karim al-Iryani said in an interview that the two men who carried out the suicide bombing last month have been identified as Yemeni veterans of the U.S.-backed guerrilla war to drive Soviet forces from Afghanistan. Al-Iryani also told The Washington Post that one of the men who steered the small boat carrying plastic explosives into the U.S. ship was a Yemeni born in the eastern province of Hadramaut. Although U.S. officials declined to comment on the Yemeni official's remarks, Watson said, ``Investigation by Yemeni authorities and sustained cooperation with U.S. efforts continue to result in more than satisfactory progress.'' ``The pace of progress has enabled the FBI to further reduce in-country presence, having completed many aspects of the investigation,'' Watson added in a statement released here. ``Because of the investigative achievements to date, the FBI will soon be able to bring home the FBI's senior onsite commander, John O'Neill.'' O'Neill is chief of the national security division of the FBI's New York office, which is in charge of the Cole investigation. The FBI presence in Yemen, which once involved more than 150 agents and evidence technicians, had dropped by late October to fewer than 40. The previous withdrawals came after most of the physical evidence was retrieved from the ship and from several houses in the port of Aden where the attackers apparently prepared their boat. FBI officials said some agents would remain in Yemen after O'Neill returns but they would not predict how many. U.S. officials said Friday they are near signing an agreement with the Yemenis on a resolution of the dispute between the FBI and Yemeni investigators over whether U.S. agents could interview witnesses and suspects in custody there. A formal written agreement has not yet been signed, but it appeared FBI agents would be able to observe interviews and submit questions, while not participating directly in questioning, they said. That resolution would preserve Yemeni sovereignty while letting the FBI gather evidence that could be admitted to U.S. courts. If FBI agents observe the questioning, they would be able to testify in any U.S. court that torture was not employed to obtain statements from defendants and witnesses. The FBI's goal throughout has been to charge the culprits in U.S. courts. The Yemeni prime minister would not discuss other details learned in the investigation of the Oct. 12 attack that killed 17 U.S. sailors as the ship refueled in Aden. But he told the Post that authorities have solid leads to the identity of the second man, also thought to have been a native of Yemen. Al-Iryani said the identity of the first man was established by false identification discovered in one of the rented houses around Aden, where the attack was planned. The name on the ID forms, which included a boating license, was false, but the photo was genuine. The prime minister also told the Post that Yemeni investigators have learned a lot from the man's relatives. ``The picture inside the country should be very clear very soon. The question is outside. Who was involved outside the country?'' he said. Investigators have focused on Muslim extremists angered by the U.S. military presence in the Arabian Peninsula, especially Saudi Arabia. U.S. investigators have said the attack bears the earmarks of followers of Osama bin Laden, the exiled Saudi millionaire and Afghanistan veteran who officials say ordered the 1998 bombing of U.S. embassies in Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. The prime minister said Yemeni investigators have not linked the Aden bombing to bin Laden, who has Yemeni citizenship by his father's birth in the Hadramaut region. But al-Iryani said a wider conspiracy seems obvious to Yemeni officials, who believe the Cole attack displayed technical savvy unknown in their country.

President Clinton arrived early Sunday in this city, the former Saigon, 25 years after America's final evacuation in the face of victorious communist forces. Despite the late hour of his arrival, thousands of people lined the president's route for the 15-minute drive from the airport. After a day of poignant reminders of the losses America suffered in the war, Clinton flew here from Hanoi, where he attend a silent ceremony at Noi Bai airport for the formal repatriation of remains believed to be those of three U.S. servicemen. Earlier, Clinton also met with Vietnam's Communist Party chief, Le Kha Phieu, who, a senior American official said, spoke the language of ``old socialism'' in a meeting with Clinton and did not respond when he suggested that the country would benefit from more political freedom. ``It was the more traditional side of Vietnamese politics,'' the official said. ``He did talk about openness. He did talk about private entrepreneurship, but more clearly in the context of what you would have heard here 10 years ago or 15 years ago.'' A senior administration official said of the Vietnamese, ``They know they won the war, but they are wondering what went wrong with the peace.''

Rescuers pulled a survivor from the snow and found another person dead after an avalanche buried an unknown number of people Sunday on a ski slope in the western province of Tyrol, media reported. The survivor, who was not identified, was flown by helicopter to the University Hospital in Innsbruck, the Austria Press Agency and state television said. As many as five people were believed to have been buried under the snow mass, but no exact figure was immediately known. Hours later, a second avalanche roared down a mountainside just miles from the first slide. Rescue workers were on their way, but there was no immediate report of missing. Police from the small community of Obergurgl, 215 miles west of Vienna, mounted a search for survivors from the first slide, concentrating on the Rosskar ski area, where eyewitnesses said skiers had ventured onto slopes that had been closed because of the danger of avalanches. The tiny resort is very isolated and situated nearly 10,000 feet above sea level, almost on the Austrian border with Italy, south of Innsbruck. Around 60 people from the regional mountain rescue service, together with specially trained mountain dogs were involved in the search. Tourists and skiers were reported to be helping in the effort. The avalanche comes a little over a week after Austria's biggest ski disaster, when 155 people were killed in a fire inside a tunnel in the Kitzsteinhorn Mountain at the resort of Kaprun in the province of Salzburg.

The announcement came amid a growing corruption scandal revolving around Fujimori's fugitive ex-intelligence chief, Vladimiro Montesinos. It was Montesinos' appearance in a leaked video apparently bribing an opposition congressman that forced Fujimori's decision in September to step down next July after new elections _ ending a decade of iron-fisted rule. Normally under the constitution, First Vice President Francisco Tudela would assume the presidency. But Tudela presented his resignation hours after Montesinos returned to Peru on Oct. 23 after a failed asylum bid in Panama. Tudela complained that Fujimori was not in control of Montesinos and his allies. Second Vice President Ricardo Marquez said last week that he, too, would resign if Congress took measures to remove Fujimori. On Thursday, opposition lawmakers took control of Congress for the first time since 1992 with the election of Valentin Paniagua to the post of Congress president _ opening the way for lawmakers to remove Fujimori on grounds of ``moral incapacity'' _ as permitted by the Constitution. That would open the way for Paniagua, a political moderate, to assume the presidency until new elections are held April 8. Paniagua is the next in line for the presidency after the second vice president.

Fujimori was widely criticized at home for leaving Peru to attend the Nov. 15-16 Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum summit. He then made an unannounced detour to Japan, canceling a planned trip to Panama this weekend where Spanish-speaking and Portuguese-speaking leaders held an Ibero-American summit. Then on Saturday, the government announced that Fujimori planned to remain in Tokyo until Wednesday to negotiate loans to ease Peru's financial problems. The reason for Fujimori's prolonged stay in Japan prompted speculation that Fujimori was planning to quit the presidency and possibly stay in his ancestral homeland.

An Egyptian military court convicted 15 members of the outlawed Muslim Brotherhood, the movement that has become the biggest opposition faction in parliament, sentencing them to three to five years in prison. Five other defendants were acquitted, according to the rulings handed down by the military court Sunday. The Brotherhood, which aims to implement Islamic law in Egypt, won 17 parliament seats, more than any other opposition group, in elections that ended last week. The Brotherhood candidates ran as independents because the group is banned. President Hosni Mubarak's ruling party still dominates the 444-seat body. The 20 defendants were charged with being members of a banned group, harming national peace, trying to take control of trade unions and distributing pamphlets to spread their ideas. Mohammed Badi Sami, Saad Zaghloul el-Ashmawi and Ahmed Ibrahim el-Halwani _ a veterinarian, doctor and teacher, respectively _ received five years imprisonment and 12 others got three years. Mukhtar Nouh, a leading lawyer who defends Muslim fundamentalists, was among those who received three years. Nouh is also the treasurer of the Egyptian Lawyers' Union, a member of the Brotherhood's consultative council and a former member of Parliament. ``We knew from the start that this was a political case and we prepared ourselves accordingly. However, we didn't expect the sentences to be this harsh,'' said defense attorney Mohamed Touson. Maj. Gen. Ahmed el-Anwar, the presiding judge of the three-judge tribunal, said the Brotherhood works ``to impede (Egypt's) progress and flourishing and to harm the country's supreme interests.'' The 20 were arrested in October last year and the trial began in December. The military courts were set up to try terrorists but have also tried other members of the Muslim Brotherhood. Human rights organizations and opposition parties have repeatedly criticized the trials of government opponents in military courts, which operate under emergency laws imposed in 1981 by Mubarak's government. The courts' verdicts cannot be appealed, and only the president can pardon those found guilty. The Muslim Brotherhood, founded in 1928, was banned in 1954. It was tolerated by the government until 1995, when it was accused of supporting an armed Islamic insurgency that had begun three years earlier. The group says it has renounced violence, yet hundreds of its members have been put on trial and scores imprisoned. The Brotherhood, which had only one seat in the departing parliament, had long claimed election fraud kept it from showing its true influence in Egypt. During the recent balloting, there were charges that police turned away would-be voters expected to support Brotherhood members. The vote was also marred by violence and charges of vote buying and meddling with voter lists. The government arrested more than 1,000 Brotherhood sympathizers shortly before the election. They have all been released since.

Signaling the apparent demise of one of Latin America's most authoritarian rulers, two top government officials announced on Sunday that President Alberto Fujimori is planning to resign by Tuesday, ending a tumultuous decade in power that saw him do battle with terrorists, drug traffickers and hyperinflation before succumbing to a series of scandals. Second Vice President Ricardo Marquez, who until recently was a political unknown, said he was ready to take power until a new president can be elected in April and inaugurated on July 28. ``President Alberto Fujimori will present his resignation to Congress on Monday or Tuesday at the latest,'' Prime Minister Federico Salas said on a national radio network on Sunday morning. Salas stopped short of explaining why Fujimori, Latin America's second-longest surviving leader, after Fidel Castro of Cuba, was resigning so suddenly, but he added, ``What I know is that he does not want to be an obstacle to the process of democratization so that the next elections can be absolutely transparent.'' There was no immediate word from Fujimori, who is visiting Japan, but Sunda's announcements capped nine weeks in which the president's stature, once near invincible, has been in a free fall. Fijimori, 62, had gradually lost his grip on power since winning a third five-year term in May in an election that was widely perceived as tainted. The fall began in mid-September when a videotape leaked to a cable television channel showed Fujimori's right-hand man, the intelligence chief Vladimiro Montesinos, apparently offering a $15,000 bribe to a congressman to switch parties. The tape was the opening act in a gripping political drama: Fujimori tried to save himself by dumping Montesinos, even over the opposition of military commanders, and promising that a new president would take office next July. Next, Montesinos resigned and flew to Panama seeking asylum, but returned and went into hiding last month. Fujimori ordered the arrest of Montesinos, who is considered to know all Peru's best-kept secrets, and even led the manhunt. But the intelligence chief remains at large, as reports emerge of several foreign bank accounts in which Montesinos is said to have at least $58 million. Fujimori, a son of Japanese immigrants, has frequently sought help from Japan in times of trouble, and is currently reported to be seeking financial aid to close his government's growing deficit. It was not immediately clear whether Fujimori would return to Peru or remain in Japan or some other Asian country to seek asylum. In Fujimori's absence, various opposition parties took control of Congress last week and elected a centrist congressman, Valentin Paniagua, as the leader of Congress. Should the opposition decide to remove the little known Marquez from power before the elections, scheduled for April 8, Paniagua could take over as president. But he is not considered a strong contender against the front-runner, Alejandro Toledo, another centrist who ran closely behind Fujimori in the first round of this year's election before dropping out of the second round, saying the vote was unfair. Salas telephoned the U.S. ambassador, John R. Hamilton, on Sunday to say Fujimori would not be returning to Peru anytime soon, a senior Clinton administration official said. Should Fujimori come back to Lima, he could face an inquiry into his financial dealings from government prosecutors already investigating Montesinos. Peruvian prosecutors are looking into charges that Montesinos was involved in running guns to Colombian guerrillas, laundering money and directing death squads. Fujimori, a former college professor, emerged from obscurity in 1990 to defeat the writer Mario Vargas Llosa and win the presidency. Facing a growing security threat from two terrorist groups and unable to persuade Congress to enact his program, he suspended the legislature and the Supreme Court in 1992. He defied the United States and the Organization of American States by taking nearly dictatorial powers, but his move was broadly endorsed by the Peruvian people, who handed him a landslide election victory in 1995. Even critics say Fujimori has accomplished much as president, virtually defeating the two terrorist groups, reducing inflation to single digits, making peace with Ecuador after several wars and significantly reducing both coca cultivation and trafficking in cocaine. But his often high-handed style undercut the independence of the courts and Congress, and landed hundreds if not thousands of innocent people in prison. He used much of his second term maneuvering to make way for a third term, which seemed not to be allowed by the Constitution. Controlling the new Congress and courts, Fujimori was able to get around this roadblock but a recession has eroded his popularity. This year he relied on Montesinos to defeat a growing opposition, but many Peruvians found the manipulation of the television media and the electoral apparatus difficult to accept. Salas said Fujimori had not ruled out running for Congress, which could give him immunity from prosecution. Fujimori has hinted that he would like to make a comeback and win back the presidency in the future. Salas also said Fujimori would resign from Japan, sending his resignation letter to Congress from there. Marquez, who replaced First Vice President Francisco Tudela after he resigned last month, said Fujimori had asked him to take power once his resignation took effect. The Japanese news media has speculated that Fujimori would remain in Japan for treatment of an unspecified disease. He has repeatedly refused to make any comments to reporters since he arrived in Japan late last week from a Pacific Rim leadership conference in Brunei. Fujimori had been scheduled to leave Tokyo for Panama on Saturday to attend a Latin summit meeting before returning to Lima, but he changed his plans at the last minute.

the current president concluded a historic visit to vietnam today. his final stop? the city formerly known as saigon, scene of a mass u.s. evacuation 25 years ago, when this country decided to withdraw from vietnam. nbc's fred francis is traveling with the president. no one works a crowd like william jefferson clinton. it does not matter that this is vietnam. he loved it, and the people here seemed to love him, if only because the americans were back, briefly. that is not to say the communist government was overjoyed with his visit. thousands of people were chased off the streets for his midnight arrival. "the government," said one vietnamese, "did not want to be embarrassed by an american president sparking such enthusiasm." you should be very praddo oh in his first speech of the day, the president took a poke at the old-style leaders here, saying the rewards of a free market economy "should be embraced, not feared." the years of animosity are past. today, we have a shared interest in your well-being and prosperity. we have a stake in your future and wish to be your partners. but silent partners if the communists have their way. in fact, they did little in advance publicity for this historic visit. the little official blurb that i saw in the english-language vietnamese newspaper on the way over, was a one-inch -- one column, one inch saying that mr. clinton and his wife will be here. for the vast majority of vietnamese, mr. clinton's visit is little more than a curiosity. but here in the south, in the former saigon, they sense that it's something special. here, the u.s. is still number one. fred francis, nbc news, ho chi minh city.

President Alberto Fujimori, whose 10-year authoritarian rule has crumbled in recent months over corruption scandals, said in Tokyo early Monday that he would resign within 48 hours. Fujimori issued a brief written statement confirming announcements made hours earlier in Peru by his prime minister and his second vice president. Second Vice President Ricardo Marquez said Fujimori, who has been in his ancestral homeland Japan since Friday, had asked him to step in as president until special elections are held in April and a new leader takes office in July. The statement issued by Fujimori did not explain why he was stepping down. Prime Minister Federico Salas said the president would give his reasons when he presents his resignation to Congress on Monday or Tuesday. ``What I know is that he does not want to be an obstacle to the process of democratization so that the next elections can be elections absolutely transparent for the Peruvian people,'' Salas told radio station Radioprogramas. Fujimori refused to meet with a crowd of reporters who had gathered at his Tokyo hotel. A Peruvian embassy official, who refused to give his name, handed out a brief statement in Spanish confirming that the president would resign. ``President Alberto Fujimori confirmed ... that he is resigning as president,'' the statement said. ``In the course of 48 hours, he is going to formalize the decision with the newly elected president of the Congress.'' It was not immediately clear if Fujimori intended to go back to Peru to hand in his resignation. In Washington, White House spokeswoman Mary Ellen Countryman said the United States would work with the Organization of American States to insure a smooth transition. ``What's important for Peru is that the transition to the April 8 elections proceeds smoothly and peacefully. And we will continue to work with the OAS on that process.'' Fujimori's announcement came amid a growing corruption scandal around the president's fugitive ex-intelligence chief, Vladimiro Montesinos. The scandal forced the 62-year-old Fujimori to announce in September that he would step down in July after new elections _ ending a decade of iron-fisted rule. Normally under the constitution, First Vice President Francisco Tudela would assume the presidency. But Tudela presented his resignation hours after Montesinos returned to Peru on Oct. 23 after a failed asylum bid in Panama. Tudela complained that Fujimori was not in control of Montesinos and his allies. Marquez, the second vice president, had said that he, too, would resign if Congress _ which last week came under opposition control for the first time since 1992 _ took measures to remove Fujimori. But he said Sunday that Fujimori asked him not to quit. ``I've just spoken with him and he has said he would like me to assume the position and I told the president that ... I am going to take the post,'' Marquez told radio station CPN. But there were signs that a power struggle may develop. Former presidential candidate Alejandro Toledo _ who boycotted a May runoff against Fujimori, alleging fraud _ said in a radio interview from France that Marquez's association with Fujimori's ``illegitimate'' government should rule him out as a transition leader. Peru's human rights ombudsman Jorge Santistevan said Tudela, the first vice president, had the right to the post because Congress had not yet accepted his resignation. ``I am sure Tudela is up to the circumstances of administering the executive branch until the end and guaranteeing that Paniagua plays the role that corresponds to his democratic credentials in Congress,'' Santistevan said. Next in line for succession after the second vice president is the Congress president, Valentin Paniagua, a political moderate who was installed last week by opposition legislators. Fujimori's trip abroad prompted a wave of rumors that he would step down and seek asylum. He was criticized for leaving Peru to attend the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum summit in Brunei on Wednesday and Thursday. On Friday, he made an unannounced detour to Japan, canceling a planned trip to Panama this weekend where Spanish-speaking and Portuguese-speaking leaders held an Ibero-American summit. At first Japanese officials had said he was in the country only for a layover to change planes, then Japan's Foreign Ministry said Fujimori would stay longer than planned because he had a cold. But later Saturday, the Peruvian government announced that Fujimori planned to remain in Tokyo until Wednesday to negotiate loans to ease Peru's financial problems. Fujimori, who first came to power in 1990, was born to Japanese immigrant parents who picked cotton in Peru until they opened a tailor's shop in downtown Lima. The president has maintained strong ties to Japan. His son, Hiro, lives there, as do his sister and brother-in-law, Victor Aritomi, Peru's ambassador to the country. Fujimori's grip on power began to fall apart after Montesinos, his longtime top aide was seen apparently bribing an opposition lawmaker to support the government. A videotape of the meeting between Montesinos and the lawmaker was leaked to the media. Montesinos fled to Panama but was denied asylum and returned to Peru. Since then, Fujimori has led an unsuccessful manhunt for Montesinos, who is wanted for alleged money-laundering after Swiss authorities froze $48 million in accounts linked to the former spymaster. The amount under investigation swelled to $58 million after other accounts were discovered, authorities said. Montesinos faces criminal complaints in Peru ranging from directing state-sponsored death squads and torture to skimming profits from narcotics trades during his 10 years as Fujimori's top aide. Despite Montesinos' dark reputation, Fujimori for years defended their close relationship, insisting that Montesinos had proved highly effective in helping to defeat leftist rebels and undercut narcotics trafficking. Fujimori won a third five-year term last May in an election marred by irregularities and boycotted by international observers. His foes said Montesinos masterminded an illegal campaign of intimidation, fraud and dirty tricks to ensure Fujimori's victory. ``Fujimori's resignation under these circumstances does nothing but confirm his responsibility for 10 years of control of Peru by a mafia,'' said opposition Congressman Fernando Olivera. ``Fujimori is mistaken if he thinks that this resignation will be enough to obtain complete impunity. The slate should not be wiped clean.''

After decades of development as Europe's year-round playground, the Alps may be suffering from overload. Mudslides, avalanches and last weekend's fire in the Kitzsteinhorn mountain tunnel that killed 155 people have led some environmentalists to question whether it's time to scale back on the construction of resorts, hiking trails and ski runs that expanded as Europe's economy has grown. ``We cannot continue to treat the mountains as we have in the past and maintain this pace into the future,'' said Daniela Grabher of the Austrian Ecological Institute in Bregrenz. The recent record points to increasing risks. In the past three years, about 50 people have been killed in avalanches in the Austrian Alps _ including four who were caught in a pair of avalanches Sunday at ski resorts in western Austria. And in the worst accident suffered by the Austrian skiing industry, 155 people died earlier this month when a fire broke out in a cable car going through a mountain tunnel. For centuries, however, the now posh Alpine regions of Austria, eastern France, Switzerland and northern Italy were destitute. The steep slopes and high mountain pastures were good for little else but subsistence-farming and small-scale cattle raising. Isolated in villages strung along narrow valleys, mountain people struggled to survive in harsh winters with few educational or economic opportunities. Massive ranges prevented easy access to markets in the outside world. All that changed in the 19th century, when Europe's newly rich industrialists could afford the luxury of clean air and pristine scenery. Adolf Hitler encouraged Germans to visit the Alps, believing they would connect with their Teutonic past. After Europe began to recover from World War II, the Austrian government, seeing a way to bring much-needed income to its backward areas, promoted tourism, subsidizing an industry that now accounts for more than 20 percent of the nation's gross domestic product. About a half million of Austria's 8 million people earn their living directly from the Alpine tourism industry. In Kaprun, scene of the tunnel disaster, 80 percent of the village's 3,200 people live off tourism. Between Christmas and Easter, an average of 450,000 skiers and snowboarders stay in Kaprun, bringing in some $92 million. Thousands more visit in warmer months to hike in the hills and enjoy the town's breathtaking scenery. Less than a week after the disaster, tourism officials have already begun thinking up new advertising campaigns to prevent the region from losing its image and to try to attract visitors, without being disrespectful to those who died. ``We want to let people know that to come skiing here is totally harmless,'' said Hans Wallner, chief of the Kaprun tourism bureau. Reinhold Messner, a member of the European Parliament, disagrees. Messner, an experienced mountaineer from western Austria, maintains that the Alps and other mountain ranges are inherently dangerous. Sudden storms, avalanches and other mountain risks are not new, Messner says. But now, these natural phenomena threaten hotels, vacation homes and ski trails in potentially risky areas. He is drafting legislation in the European Parliament to place limits on mass, unregulated Alpine tourism. ``We attract tourists to these regions where we can't guarantee their security,'' Messner said in an interview with the Austria Press Agency. ``Over time, our only chance at safety will depend on whether the mountains are not turned into Disneyland.'' Austria is not alone. In October, more than 30 people were killed in northern Italy and southern Switzerland in flooding that sent mudslides gushing down on Alpine villages. In Switzerland, 21 people drowned in the Alps in July, 1999, while canyoning, which involves sliding, jumping and rappelling down ravines and into rivers without a raft. In July, 20 people were killed in the French Alps in a gondola accident. Massive avalanches last February killed 12 people near the ski resort of Chamonix. A month later, a fire that broke out on a truck in the Mont Blanc tunnel, killing 45 people. In Sunday's incident, two skiers were buried alive in the western Austrian province of Tyrol, and a third died en route to the hospital after being dug out of the snow. Hours later, a second avalanche roared down a mountainside in nearby Goelbner, killing one man.

President Alberto Fujimori, whose 10-year authoritarian rule has crumbled in recent months over corruption scandals, said in Tokyo early Monday that he would resign within 48 hours. Fujimori issued a brief written statement confirming announcements made hours earlier in Peru by his prime minister and his second vice president. Second Vice President Ricardo Marquez said Fujimori, who has been in his ancestral homeland Japan since Friday, had asked him to step in as president until special elections are held in April and a new leader takes office in July. The statement issued by Fujimori did not explain why he was stepping down. Prime Minister Federico Salas said the president would give his reasons when he presents his resignation to Congress on Monday or Tuesday. ``What I know is that he does not want to be an obstacle to the process of democratization so that the next elections can be elections absolutely transparent for the Peruvian people,'' Salas told radio station Radioprogramas. Fujimori refused to meet with a crowd of reporters who had gathered at his Tokyo hotel. A Peruvian embassy official, who refused to give his name, handed out a brief statement in Spanish confirming that the president would resign. ``President Alberto Fujimori confirmed ... that he is resigning as president,'' the statement said. ``In the course of 48 hours, he is going to formalize the decision with the newly elected president of the Congress.'' It was not immediately clear if Fujimori intended to go back to Peru to hand in his resignation. Fujimori's ministers said they had decided to resign but would continue on until it was clear who was taking over the government. In a written statement, the ministers expressed their ``indignation'' that Fujimori's announcement was ``made outside the country in the context of a grave crisis and uncertainty about his return.'' In Washington, White House spokeswoman Mary Ellen Countryman said the United States would work with the Organization of American States to insure a smooth transition. ``What's important for Peru is that the transition to the April 8 elections proceeds smoothly and peacefully. And we will continue to work with the OAS on that process.'' Fujimori's announcement came amid a growing corruption scandal around the president's fugitive ex-intelligence chief, Vladimiro Montesinos. The scandal forced the 62-year-old Fujimori to announce in September that he would step down in July after new elections _ ending a decade of iron-fisted rule. Normally under the constitution, First Vice President Francisco Tudela would assume the presidency. But Tudela presented his resignation hours after Montesinos returned to Peru on Oct. 23 after a failed asylum bid in Panama. Tudela complained that Fujimori was not in control of Montesinos and his allies. Marquez, the second vice president, had said that he, too, would resign if Congress _ which last week came under opposition control for the first time since 1992 _ took measures to remove Fujimori. But he said Sunday that Fujimori asked him not to quit. ``I've just spoken with him and he has said he would like me to assume the position and I told the president that ... I am going to take the post,'' Marquez told radio station CPN. But there were signs that a power struggle may develop. Former presidential candidate Alejandro Toledo _ who boycotted a May runoff against Fujimori, alleging fraud _ said in a radio interview from France that Marquez's association with Fujimori's ``illegitimate'' government should rule him out as a transition leader. Peru's human rights ombudsman Jorge Santistevan said Tudela, the first vice president, had the right to the post because Congress had not yet accepted his resignation. ``I am sure Tudela is up to the circumstances of administering the executive branch until the end and guaranteeing that Paniagua plays the role that corresponds to his democratic credentials in Congress,'' Santistevan said. Next in line for succession after the second vice president is the Congress president, Valentin Paniagua, a political moderate who was installed last week by opposition legislators. Fujimori's trip abroad prompted a wave of rumors that he would step down and seek asylum. He was criticized for leaving Peru to attend the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum summit in Brunei on Wednesday and Thursday. On Friday, he made an unannounced detour to Japan, canceling a planned trip to Panama this weekend where Spanish-speaking and Portuguese-speaking leaders held an Ibero-American summit. At first Japanese officials had said he was in the country only for a layover to change planes, then Japan's Foreign Ministry said Fujimori would stay longer than planned because he had a cold. But later Saturday, the Peruvian government announced that Fujimori planned to remain in Tokyo until Wednesday to negotiate loans to ease Peru's financial problems. Fujimori, who first came to power in 1990, was born to Japanese immigrant parents who picked cotton in Peru until they opened a tailor's shop in downtown Lima. The president has maintained strong ties to Japan. His son, Hiro, lives there, as do his sister and brother-in-law, Victor Aritomi, Peru's ambassador to the country. Fujimori's grip on power began to fall apart after Montesinos, his longtime top aide was seen apparently bribing an opposition lawmaker to support the government. A videotape of the meeting between Montesinos and the lawmaker was leaked to the media. Montesinos fled to Panama but was denied asylum and returned to Peru. Since then, Fujimori has led an unsuccessful manhunt for Montesinos, who is wanted for alleged money-laundering after Swiss authorities froze $48 million in accounts linked to the former spymaster. The amount under investigation swelled to $58 million after other accounts were discovered, authorities said. Montesinos faces criminal complaints in Peru ranging from directing state-sponsored death squads and torture to skimming profits from narcotics trades during his 10 years as Fujimori's top aide. Despite Montesinos' dark reputation, Fujimori for years defended their close relationship, insisting that Montesinos had proved highly effective in helping to defeat leftist rebels and undercut narcotics trafficking. Fujimori won a third five-year term last May in an election marred by irregularities and boycotted by international observers. His foes said Montesinos masterminded an illegal campaign of intimidation, fraud and dirty tricks to ensure Fujimori's victory. ``Fujimori's resignation under these circumstances does nothing but confirm his responsibility for 10 years of control of Peru by a mafia,'' said opposition Congressman Fernando Olivera. ``Fujimori is mistaken if he thinks that this resignation will be enough to obtain complete impunity. The slate should not be wiped clean.''

President Clinton's historic three-day visit to communist-ruled Vietnam was partly aimed at invigorating economic cooperation between the two former enemies. Asian News center, the slow pace of economic reform in Vietnam continues to be a huge obstacle to closer business ties and more trade. As the first serving US President to visit post war Vietnam, Mr. Clinton can take credit for smoothing the path to reconciliation. In 1994, he lifted a punitive trade embargo that had been in place since the war ended in 1975 in a communist victory. President Clinton then oversaw the establishment of diplomatic relations in 1995. Earlier this year, he persuaded both countries to sign a bilateral trade agreement. The deal calls for Vietnam to continue economic reform and open its markets to foreign goods. The United States is required to provide Vietnam with investments, training, as well as business and technical assistance. Neither side has yet to ratify the trade pact but the Vice Chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in Hanoi, Tony Foster says the agreement is sorely needed. He notes many US firms that had rushed in to invest six years ago, have left, frustrated by Vietnam's complex bureaucracy, high costs and corruption. I think there still substantial skepticism about whether the reward that you can obtain from investing in the country, or worse, the evident risks of coming here. I think the general enthusiasm of the early to mid 90's certainly don't exist. Despite a reasonable recovery from the 1997 Asian financial crisis, Mr. Foster says foreign investments in Vietnam are not expected to top more than $780 million this year, a 10-year low. International donors have criticized Vietnam for stalling on previous pledges to reform its creaking economy. Nearly half of the country's economic output still comes from state-owned firms, severely limiting competition. That could potentially make it difficult for Vietnam to fully comply with extensive market opening provisions contained in the trade pact. Still the agreement does hold some promise for increased bilateral trade. The deal, once passed, would see import tariffs drop significantly. Hanoi is projecting its exports to the United States, mainly footwear, garments and seafood, to grow by at least 30 percent in the first three years after ratification. Meanwhile, Vietnam's economy is showing signs of recovering from a thee-year slump. The government says the economy grew almost seven percent this year, up from less than five percent in 1999. Foreign companies currently operating in Vietnam like Ford Motors are posting better second half earnings. The company's General Director Debra Erinson says business confidence appears to have reemerged with the signing of the trade agreement. The business environment is much better. I think that the Vietnamese community feels much better about the economy and they are starting to spend the money that they have been saving. This is a very young country, with 79 and half million people, 80 percent of the population is 30 years old or younger. With the trade agreement and more investments in this country, the income levels are going to go up, the employment levels will continue to go up. You can chart what's going to happen in the future. US trade officials say representatives of more than 40 US companies will be in Vietnam with Mr. Clinton to study investment opportunities. They will also likely watch to see if the presidential trip can spur Vietnam's reform process ahead of the trade agreement ratification expected to happen by mid next year.

Bill Clinton went to extraordinary lengths 30 years ago to avoid showing up here for the United States' first conflict with Vietnam. But in the final days of his presidency, with crowds cheering him on in Hanoi, and on Sunday in the city that Americans will always call Saigon, Clinton threw himself into the middle of Vietnam's most immediate conflict: the battle within a divided government over how fast and how far to open the country to the capitalist, democratic forces that Vietnam's Communist leaders thought they had defeated. The players, the passions and the geopolitics are entirely different, of course, and America's stake in the outcome is vastly diminished. Yet throughout the president's visit _ as he plunged into crowds, debated Vietnam's conservative elite, and talked on Sunday morning with young entrepreneurs for whom the Ho Chi Minh Trail is a highway project _ everyone involved understood exactly what was going on. Clinton was here chiefly to celebrate reconciliation. But it was reconciliation with an edge, because at every turn he argued that the Communist government in Hanoi could not overcome the forces of global economic integration the way it overcame the United States and its allies over a quarter-century ago. Vietnam's plans to flourish economically, he insisted, will work only if the country builds a fair legal system, allows free travel, embraces the Internet, and gradually opens its political system. Clearly, many in the streets seemed to get the message, and some who disagreed came out to wave and cheer anyway. But Clinton left the country's leaders exactly where he found them: bickering, conflicted and wondering how they had won the war and lost the peace. In a remarkable moment at the Communist Party headquarters in Hanoi late Saturday afternoon, Clinton plunged into a spirited exchange with the country's leading hard-liner, Le Kha Phieu, the Communist Party chief and the most influential member of the Vietnamese leadership. Phieu had watched Clinton's nationally broadcast speech to students and seen the reception the president was getting on the streets, and clearly he was fed up. ``We have seen the collapse of the USSR,'' Phieu said of his country's former patron. And yet, he told the president, according to two American participants in the meeting, ``we are still on our feet, we have reaffirmed socialism.'' He went on to describe how Vietnam had begun to produce enough rice to feed itself and how it was determined to find its own way without surrendering its socialist principles. He argued that the economy could grow, even if it is divided into state sectors, private sectors and foreign sectors, with politically sensitive technologies still controlled by the government. One of Clinton's top advisers, who witnessed the encounter, said his sense was that the Communist Party chief was saying in effect: ``There is a line. We kicked you guys out. And now we are going to be friendly, but there is only so far we will go.'' The two leaders argued, politely, over whether the United States had ``imperialist'' intentions here. Clinton told CNN on Sunday, ``I stoutly disputed that we were an imperialist country'' during the war, insisting that the conflict had been ``over what self-determination for the Vietnamese people really meant.'' They were talking about days long past. But the subtext of the discussion was very much about today, about Phieu's reluctance to let Vietnam plunge into a world and a marketplace dominated by American power. Contrast that conversation with the one Clinton held Sunday afternoon with Vo Viet Thahn, the closest thing Ho Chi Minh City has to a mayor, who came here as a North Vietnamese battalion commander helping to seize Saigon in 1975. ``It was like night and day,'' said Sandy Berger, Clinton's national security adviser. ``We could have been talking to any big-city mayor in the United States.'' Thahn talked proudly about all the private-sector jobs that had been created in this teeming city of motor scooters and smog, and how a 10 percent growth rate had brought the city's poverty level down. Clinton asked what the United States might do to help. ``Low-income housing projects,'' Thahn immediately suggested. That is a long way from Thahn's objective here 25 years ago, which was to wipe out any vestiges of American influence. Indeed, the visceral attraction to the United States was the big surprise of this trip, reminiscent of Japan's fascination with all things American after World War II (the difference, of course, being that the United States won that war.) While many Americans watching snippets of the visit on television were undoubtedly thinking about Clinton's effort to sidestep the draft, the Vietnamese saw a man who had lifted the economic embargo against their country, normalized diplomatic relations, and arrived here with a backup plane full of potential investors. ``The last American president we liked was Kennedy,'' said Do Thi La, a 47-year-old shopkeeper, as she watched Clinton's motorcade speed past. ``But Clinton may have done more good things for Vietnam.'' There is an inevitable tendency during trips like this to overstate American influence, and to assume that just because the crowds were cheering, the outcome of the newest Vietnam conflict is preordained. That would be dangerous. The debate in Vietnam closely parallels the one under way in China today. There, too, leaders are caught between the necessity of attracting global capital and the reality that openness will inevitably undercut their power. In both places, it is increasingly easy to find great restaurants, and increasingly hard to find committed Communists. But it is also true that hard-liners like Phieu appear to be on the rise in Hanoi, at least for now. For all the talk about the power of globalization, most of Vietnam's 78 million people cannot afford a telephone and have never wandered into one of Saigon's chic Internet cafes. So at moments the optimistic talk among Clinton's aides about the inevitability of economic and political reform in Vietnam seemed like an eerie echo of the days when Robert McNamara, Kennedy's defense secretary, declared that ``every quantitative measurement we have shows we are winning the war.'' Maybe this time, the leaders in Hanoi have no real choice. They don't have many dominoes to play, they don't have allies willing to prop them up, and to the rest of the world it makes far less difference whether they succeed or fail. But as the author Ward Just wrote in a new foreword this year to his 1967 book, ``To What End,'' during the war ``No one knew the truth of things, whether the tide was in or out or where on the shore we stood.'' He could have been writing about Vietnam today.

Italy swept the giant slalom Sunday at the snowboarding World Cup, with Walter Feichter and Carmen Ranigler winning the men's and women's divisions. Stefan Kaltschuetz of Austria was second and Daniel Biveson of Sweden finished third in the men's division. Marlon Posch of Italy came in second and Heidi Renoth of Germany was third in the women's race. The event was dominated last season by Austria and France. On Saturday, Stine Kjeldaas of Norway won the women's half-pipe event, with Gian Simmen of Switzerland the men's champion. Joni Vastamaki of Finland won the men's snowboard cross event in poor visibility Friday. Olympic champion Karine Ruby of France was the top woman. At Tignes, the competitors have begun the qualifying process leading to the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City. World Cup snowboarding was to take place next in Kaprun, Austria. But organizers canceled the races because of the fire that killed more than 150 people riding a cable car in a mountain tunnel.

President Clinton flew home from Vietnam early Monday, ending his historic mission by telling the communist foe of a generation past that Americans ``wish to be your partners.'' ``I am going home determined to continue the partnership we have, for a better future for the people of Vietnam, for the people of the United States,'' Clinton told the Chamber of Commerce in Ho Chi Minh City. After a week abroad, the president headed back to the White House still uncertain who will succeed him there in just two months, Vice President Al Gore, his candidate, or Republican George W. Bush. ``This is not a crisis in the American system because it will come to an end,'' he told CNN. ``It will come to an end in plenty of time for the new president to take the oath of office.'' Clinton also said he doesn't think ``we should have all this hand-wringing, dire predictions'' that the election dispute over the 25 Florida electoral voters will leave the new president handicapped as a leader. Air Force One stopped to refuel at this base after Clinton spent a long day in Ho Chi Minh City, formerly Saigon, that had him speaking, touring and traveling more than around the clock. He lingered over Sunday evening dinner at an elegant restaurant before taking off for home. All told, his week's journey covered 22,192 miles, 44 hours of flying. There could be at least one more foreign trip before the president leaves office Jan 20. He said it is conceivable he could still go to North Korea, a possibility ruled out on this Asian trip for lack of firm progress toward an agreement by the North to stop building and exporting long-range missiles. Clinton, ever the campaigner, shook hands, shopped and waved at the scene of U.S. surrender and withdrawal in 1975. He said his reception, by thousands upon thousands of Vietnamese who lined the streets of Hanoi and then Ho Chi Minh City, was nothing short of amazing. He called it ``a big welcome for America, for the United States.'' ``I think it says a lot about what the people of Vietnam would like their relationship to America to be,'' he told reporters in the sweltering sun at a container port in Ho Chi Minh City, where he had hailed the spirit, skills and ingenuity of the new Vietnam. ``Your best days clearly lie ahead,'' he told about 2,000 business leaders and port workers, most of them in white baseball-style caps against the sun, listening through translation headphones Sunday afternoon. ``The years of animosity are past,'' said Clinton, who avoided the draft to a war he said in 1969 he hated and detested. ``Today we have a shared interest in your well-being and your prosperity. We have a stake in your future and we wish to be your partners.'' In the noon heat of Ho Chi Minh City, the president strolled with daughter Chelsea along a crowded street of open-front shops, stopping in at a half-dozen of them, buying a memento at one. He paid with a $10 bill. Clinton's journey took him first to Brunei, for the Asia Pacific Economic Forum. Then he became the first American president ever to go to Hanoi, the first to visit Vietnam since the fall of Saigon and the withdrawal of the last U.S. forces here in 1975. The Vietnam war cost 58,000 American lives, and an estimated 3 million Vietnamese. Clinton saw no display of bitterness, and said that had not surprised him. ``I think these years that we spent working together on the MIA issue and on other things'' have created the foundation of a new friendship, he said. ``I believe that America and Vietnam are linked not just by a shared and often tragic past that must be honored and remembered, but that we have a bright future that we can build together to liberate our people and their potential,'' Clinton told the audience at the container port. One of his last meetings was a 10-minute encounter with the Roman Catholic archbishop of Vietnam, Jean Baptiste Pham Minh Man, a token of his call for religious freedom and human rights.

For a week, the experts and bureaucrats argued and haggled. Now, the politicians have arrived to fill in the blanks of a 1997 agreement to stem global warming. By next weekend, participants at the U.N. climate conference hope to have a detailed agreement on how to cut emissions of the greenhouse gases that are gradually warming the planet and changing its weather. The conference is supposed to set down rules and procedures for implementation of the emissions cuts laid out three years ago in the Kyoto Protocol. Conference chairman Jan Pronk said he wants an agreement that will be both ``environmentally credible'' and politically acceptable to budget-conscious governments. It's by no means a sure thing. ``There is a real chance but the chance is not big,'' Pronk said Sunday. He said last week's preliminary talks brought some progress but no conclusion on any of the key issues. The 1997 Kyoto Protocol calls for the reduction of emissions of carbon dioxide _ primarily from fossil fuels _ and other heat-trapping gases by an average 5.2 percent from their 1990 levels. The main burden falls on the industrialized countries: Europe must cut emissions by 8 percent, the United States by 7 percent and Japan by 6 percent. The target date is 2012. The United States has been criticized for what environmentalists and some governments say is an effort to wriggle out of its commitments. The U.S. delegation supports a variety of trading mechanisms that would enable countries to meet their requirements in part by buying or earning ``credits'' from countries that exceed their reduction quotas. ``What we want is a way that makes it work without penalizing the economies of the world and our economy,'' said Sen. Larry Craig, a Republican from Idaho. Most nations at the talks want each country to meet its target by moving away from petroleum-fueled economies and by imposing greater efficiency. Craig and Sen. Chuck Hagel, a Republican from Nebraska, were sent to observe the negotiations, which are being conducted for the United States by State Department officials led by Undersecretary of State Frank Loy. U.S. officials said Sunday that they felt the Europeans had not reciprocated what they called their efforts to find common ground and show flexibility. If the conference ends in agreement, any treaty enforcing a new global emissions behavior would have to be ratified by most of the industrial countries. Without a U.S. endorsement, it would be difficult for such a treaty to come into force. The U.S. Senate already has passed a resolution making its ratification conditional on assurances that the U.S. competitiveness on world markets will not be harmed. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a board of 2,000 leading scientists, projects average temperatures may increase by up to 10.8 degrees over the next century, raising sea levels enough to sink low-lying islands, change weather patterns and kill some animal species. On Saturday, thousands of activists from around the world erected a sandbag dike around the Dutch conference venue to symbolize the threat of global warming.

A defense lawyer for U.S. businessman Edmond Pope demanded on Monday that a prosecutor in the espionage case be dismissed because his son was on the security team that investigated the American. The conflict of interest made the entire evidence presented in the trial invalid, said Pope's lawyer, Pavel Astakhov. Astakhov said that a son of state prosecutor Oleg Plotnikov was an officer of the Federal Security Service and on the team of investigators that brought the case to court. Astakhov said the law obliged Plotnikov to step down and urged the court to dismiss him. ``For four weeks, we have taken part in a trial in which the state prosecutor was biased,'' Astakhov told reporters. Pope is being tried in a closed court on charges he sought to obtain classified plans for a high-speed Russian submarine torpedo. Pope denies the charges, and relatives and supporters have said the plans were already sold abroad and weren't secret. One of Pope's key accusers has recanted a statement that implicated him in espionage. But a government commission concluded that the plans, parts of which Pope received before his arrest, were in fact classified. However, another group of experts ruled that the materials weren't classified when Pope requested them. Plotnikov did not show up at the trial on Monday, citing high blood pressure. A different prosecutor, Yuri Volgin, refused to comment on Astakhov's allegations, and the court said it would make a decision concerning Plotnikov on Tuesday. The U.S. government has urged Russia to release Pope, saying authorities have failed to show he did anything illegal, and because he is in poor health. Pope has suffered from bone cancer, which was in remission when he came to Moscow. His supporters fear the cancer may have returned. Pope, 54, of State College, Pa., is a retired U.S. Navy officer and founder of CERF Technologies International, a company specializing in studying foreign maritime equipment.

President Alberto Fujimori, who tamed Peru's leftist guerrillas but also bullied the country's democracy to fit his iron-fisted rule, is calling it quits after 10 years in office, unable to control a growing corruption scandal and a clamor for more freedom. Fujimori, on a visit to his ancestral homeland Japan, announced in a written statement early Monday that he would resign within 48 hours. It was not clear when _ or if _ he would return to Peru. Japanese officials said Monday that Fujimori had not requested political asylum. His decision took into account the fact that opposition lawmakers won control of Congress last week, the statement said. It did not elaborate, but a motion was before the 120-seat legislature to remove Fujimori as president on constitutional grounds of ``moral incapacity.'' Fujimori was initially popular for defeating the powerful Marxist Shining Path and Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement guerrillas _ which controlled much of Peru's countryside and shantytowns, and ending annual inflation that topped 7,000 percent when he took office in 1990. The signature moment of his autocratic, hands-on leadership style came in 1996 when he personally directed the rescue of 74 hostages held by Tupac Amaru rebels in the Japanese ambassador's residence in Lima. The siege ended with commandoes storming the building, killing all 14 rebels. But his popular support was eroded by lingering poverty, weariness with his autocratic ways and his close ties to his shadowy spymaster Vladimiro Montesinos, who critics charge with corruption and human rights abuses. Many Peruvians felt relief that Fujimori was finally leaving. ``I have been praying to God for Fujimori to go. He has gone but he left behind a country in ruins with people who are hungry, impoverished and without jobs,'' said Patricia Cerna Egoavil, 36, an activist with women's groups. Fujimori and Montesinos had controlled almost all aspects of Peruvian society _ from congress to the courts to television stations _ and his resignation has set off a power struggle to fill the vacuum he leaves. It was the release in September of a videotape apparently showing Montesinos bribing an opposition congressman that launched the scandal that prompted Fujimori's downfall. Fujimori's statement in Japan confirmed announcements made hours earlier in Peru by Prime Minister Federico Salas and Second Vice President Ricardo Marquez. Marquez said Sunday that he was ready to assume the presidency and lead Peru to special elections on April 8, but the issue of succession was already clouded by controversy. Under the constitution, the first vice president takes over when the president resigns. But First Vice President Francisco Tudela resigned after Montesinos returned to Peru on Oct. 23 following a failed asylum bid in Panama. Tudela, who was out of the country and not expected back until later in the week, had complained that Fujimori was not in control of Montesinos and his allies. ``The Constitution dictates that if the president has resigned, and if the first vice president has resigned, then the second vice president assumes the office,'' Marquez said, adding that the Government Palace had told him Fujimori planned to send his resignation by e-mail on Monday. But analysts pointed out that the legislature has yet to accept Tudela's resignation. Meanwhile, other opposition lawmakers questioned Marquez's democratic credentials. ``Marquez is a person linked to Fujimori's inner circle,'' said Congresswoman Milagros Huaman. ``We are going to ask for Marquez's resignation.'' Congress has no constitutional authority to expel either vice president. Legislators were expected to take up the issue of a Fujimori successor on Monday. Arriving in Madrid on Sunday on his way back to Peru, opposition leader Alejandro Toledo called on recently elected Congress President Valentin Paniagua to take over running the country and rejected calls for immediate elections. ``We need the most stable conditions for transition possible,'' Toledo told a brief news conference. ``We need time to deactivate the intelligence services of Montesinos.'' Paniagua, a political moderate who was installed last week by opposition legislators, would be constitutionally next in line after the first and second vice presidents. Leading opposition lawmakers left an emergency meeting early Monday morning saying they planned to reject Fujimori's resignation and instead vote to throw him out of office. Fujimori, 62, has seen his authoritarian rule crumble since the September release of the Montesinos's videotape. It prompted him to announce two months ago that he would step down next July after new elections in April. Fujimori tried to distance himself from Montesinos and launched a highly visible but unsuccessful manhunt for the fugitive, believed to be in hiding in Peru. But in the ensuing scandal, critics said Fujimori's disregard for democratic checks and balances provided fertile ground for Montesinos to create a network of alleged extortion, drug trafficking and arms dealing. Investigators said they discovered foreign bank accounts containing at least $58 million in illicit funds allegedly laundered by the ex-spy chief. Montesinos faces criminal complaints in Peru ranging from directing state-sponsored death squads and torture to skimming profits from the narcotics trade during his 10 years as Fujimori's top aide. Fujimori won a third five-year term last May in a vote marred by irregularities and boycotted by international observers. His foes said Montesinos masterminded an illegal campaign that used intimidation, fraud and dirty tricks to ensure the win.

Until Gao Xingjian exhibited his ink paintings at a local cultural center this spring, his working-class neighbors in the Paris suburb of Bagnolet had no idea they had an artist in their midst. He was simply the polite Chinese immigrant who lived on the 18th floor of their run-down housing project. Only after the show did he become something of a celebrity, at least to those riding the elevator with him. What his neighbors still did not know was that Gao was also a writer. Until Oct. 12, that is, when their building was invaded by reporters and television crews, Gao's face appeared on the nightly news and his name circled the world. He had won the 2000 Nobel prize in literature, and his neighbors were thrilled. They put up a sign in the building's drab lobby proclaiming it home to a Nobel laureate and began organizing a party to celebrate. Elsewhere in France and beyond, however, a more common response to his selection was, who? Gao has 18 plays, four works of literary criticism and five books of fiction to his name, but his entire oeuvre has been banned on the Chinese mainland since 1985, while his best-known novel, ``Soul Mountain,'' a lyrical account of a long journey through the Chinese backlands, has so far been published only in Taiwan, Sweden, France and Australia. Little wonder that Gao (whose name is pronounced gow shing-jen), a slightly built man with a wry sense of humor who looks a decade younger than his 60 years, was himself taken aback by his award (which carries a prize of just over $900,000). Since taking up exile here in 1987, he has lived off paintings, not writing. ``My only reaction was, `Can this be true?''' he said, recalling the telephone call from the secretary of the Swedish Academy. ``He said: `Yes, it's true. And you have to make a speech, with a written text, for 45 minutes.' `That's very long,' I said. Then almost immediately the doorbell rang, and there was a crowd of journalists. Since then it has been a storm. You can't imagine. If I plug in the phone, it rings. It's like a dripping tap you can't turn off.'' Still, the Nobel effect on his publishing career was immediate. French sales of ``Soul Mountain,'' just 6,000 in the five years preceding his Nobel Prize, have now reached 45,000. HarperCollins, which had published the book in Australia, is bringing it out in the United States next week in a translation by Mabel Lee. Foreign rights for this and his second novel, ``One Man's Bible,'' an often bitter semi-autobiographical account of China's Cultural Revolution, have been sold in several countries. Of more immediate concern to Gao, though, is his address to the Swedish Academy on Dec. 7, three days before the Nobel awards ceremony. ``It's very important,'' he said, ``more important than the prize itself, because I have the chance to make a speech to the entire world. I have to give a message as a writer. The title will be: `The Raison d'Etre of Literature.''' That he has chosen not to talk about politics should please China's cultural authorities, who were angered that the country's first Nobel literature laureate should be a political exile. Yet Gao is not fleeing political controversy. Politics may have disrupted his life, but he was never an activist: His battles in China were always about literature; the ``crime'' that drove him out in 1987 was that his work reflected, not socialist realism, but Western literary freedom. Gao's interest in Western culture dates back to his childhood in Nanjing in eastern China. His mother, a member of a YMCA theater troupe before the Communist Revolution, was an avid reader of Western literature. ``Thanks to her, we had lots of books everywhere, translations of classics, Balzac, Zola, Steinbeck,'' Gao recalled during a recent interview in French at a friend's home in Paris. ``That's why I began to read at a very early age.'' ``I always had the dream of being a writer or painter or actor or playwright,'' he went on. ``My mother and I would do little theater pieces at home. Sometimes my father was the only audience. I wrote my first novel when I was 10. It was an adventure story. At the same time, I painted. Early on, I was doing oils, water colors, calligraphy _ all sorts of things.'' His mother discouraged him from entering the National Academy of Fine Arts, so instead he studied French in Beijing. And once fluent in the language, he had access to more experimental Western literature, including plays by Ionesco, Beckett, Genet and Artaud. To his astonishment, he also found that political documents banned in China were often available in French, among them Khrushchev's famous _ and secret _ denunciation of Stalin in 1956. Chinese politics, however, posed a more direct problem. During the disastrous economic program known as the Great Leap Forward in the early 1960s, Gao's mother was sent to the countryside, where she drowned in an accident. He, too, was forced into farm labor, although by now he was also writing prolifically, albeit for himself. ``Don't send this to a publisher or a review,'' an older writer friend warned him. ``You're too young. You don't know the dangers of writing.'' Even research into literary form, he learned, could be a political crime. ``Every written text in China had to include a eulogy to the Communist Party,'' he remembered, ``even if you were writing children's short stories or teen-age things about sadness or growing up. Everything was politicized.'' Then, when the Cultural Revolution began in 1966, fearing imprisonment, Gao destroyed everything he had written. More than a decade passed before China's intellectuals dared stir anew. Gao tested the waters in 1981 with a book of essays, ``A Preliminary Discussion of the Art of Modern Fiction,'' which set off a debate about modernism and realism. He also resumed writing plays and joined the People's Art Theater in Beijing. ``The first play I wrote after the Cultural Revolution was `Bus Stop,' but the theater said it was too avant-garde to put on at the time,'' he said of a play strongly evocative of Beckett's ``Waiting for Godot.'' ``So I wrote another play, `Warning Signal,' which was presented first in 1982. It caused a polemic, but was not banned. Then `Bus Stop' was presented in 1983, and I was attacked for spiritual pollution. I was ordered to make a public self-criticism and refused. Instead, I disappeared.'' The voyage through southwestern China that followed eventually provided much of the material for ``Soul Mountain,'' although he had begun the book before fleeing Beijing. ``I said to myself, `I have already subjected myself to self-censorship, and still I was attacked,''' he recalled. ``So I started writing a novel just for myself without thinking of having it published.'' Five months later he returned to Beijing. He presented a new play, ``Wild Man,'' at the People's Art Theater in 1985, but then the political mood changed again, and he could no longer be published. ``The fight against spiritual pollution was not really against me, but against reformists in the Communist Party,'' he explained. ``The writer was simply a symbol for warning others.'' Gao began thinking of leaving China. He made one trip to Europe with a group of writers in 1985, then two years later, although on the blacklist as a writer, he was allowed to travel abroad as a painter. Convinced that the situation in China would deteriorate, he settled in Paris. Then, after the killing of demonstrators in Tiananmen Square in 1989, he resigned from the Chinese Communist Party and obtained refugee status in France. (He acquired French citizenship in 1998.) His first task as an exile was to complete ``Soul Mountain,'' which was published in Taiwan in 1990. The novel, which the Swedish Academy called ``an odyssey in time and space through the Chinese countryside,'' is remarkable not only for its magical tales, folkloric roots and eroticism but also for its patchwork of narrative styles, from poems and monologues to ballads and conversations. ``A writer has to find his own language,'' he said. ``But my language is not a style for me. In `Soul Mountain' you find all genres of literary writing. It is a research into style. But it is the language that counts, the joy of plunging into a language and finding a thread. It's what I call the flow of language. You have to respect this linear journey. Even if you change the pronouns _ I, you, he _ a novel is still like a long monologue.'' Even before ``Soul Mountain'' Gao's work had been noticed in Europe. Noel Dutrait, a French scholar, sought out Gao in Beijing in the early 1980s and began studying his plays. When ``Soul Mountain'' was completed, Dutrait and his wife, Liliane, set about translating it. Considered too long by major French publishers, it was brought out in its full 670 pages by a smaller French house, Editions L'Aube, in 1995. ``The Other Shore,'' a collection of five of his plays, was published in English last year by the Chinese University Press of Hong Kong. It is distributed in the United States by the University of Michigan Press. It was an admirer from Sweden who paved the way for the Nobel Prize. Goran Malmqvist, a China expert at the University of Stockholm, had also traveled to Beijing in the mid-'80s to meet Gao. As it happens, Gao could not be found, but he later sent several of his plays to Malmqvist, who translated them and had them produced in Stockholm. Only in 1987 did Gao finally meet his Swedish champion, who has continued to translate his works, including ``Soul Mountain.'' Thanks to Malmqvist, then, Swedish readers and theatergoers (as well as members of the Swedish Academy) can read Gao in their own language. And it could only have helped Gao's candidacy that Malmqvist is one of 18 academy members who make the final selection of Nobel laureates. Since Oct. 12, Gao's fortuitous connection to the academy has prompted some Swedish newspapers to raise questions about conflict of interest, although Malmqvist has indignantly waved away any suggestion of impropriety. Gao himself seems unperturbed. He said he felt lucky to have had friends around the world willing to promote his work when he was unknown. In 1997, for instance, Chinese friends in New York arranged for his play ``Between Life and Death'' to be presented in English at the Theater of the New City and his paintings to be shown at the Schimmel Center for the Arts. But he feels even luckier to be living outside China. ``I am not sad to be in exile,'' he said. ``It has been a renaissance for me. I have been able to live off my paintings, and I have the luxury of writing what I want. I have many friends. Writing is a solitary business, but I am not alone.''

President Alberto Fujimori submitted his resignation to Congress in a letter Monday, making good on his pledge to end 10 years of iron-fisted rule that reshaped Peru. ``I submit to you, Mr. President of Congress, my formal resignation as president of the republic,'' Fujimori wrote in a two-page letter to Congress President Valentin Paniagua. A copy was faxed to The Associated Press by the Government Palace. ``I am the first to recognize that there is a new political scenario in the country,'' said Fujimori in the letter. Fujimori's letter spoke of a ``new correlation of forces.'' It was an apparent reference to the fact that opposition lawmakers won control of Congress last week. The letter did not elaborate, but a motion had been placed before the 120-seat legislature to remove Fujimori as president on constitutional grounds of ``moral incapacity.'' Fujimori, the iron-fisted leader who won enormous popular support by smashing leftist insurgencies and rampant hyperinflation in the 1990s, found himself pilloried by those who once hailed him as Peru's savior. Fujimori acknowledged ``errors'' during his 10 years of rule but insisted he had always acted in Peru's best interests. He said he was stepping aside for the good of the country. Fujimori, on a visit to his ancestral homeland Japan, had announced in a written statement earlier Monday that he would resign within 48 hours. It was not clear when _ or if _ he would return to Peru. Japanese officials said Monday that Fujimori had not requested political asylum. But Mary Ellen Countryman, a spokeswoman for the U.S. National Security Council, said Monday that Peruvian officials have informed the U.S. government that Fujimori would stay in Japan indefinitely. Fujimori was initially popular for defeating the powerful Marxist Shining Path and Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement guerrillas _ which controlled much of Peru's countryside and shantytowns, and ending annual inflation that topped 7,000 percent when he took office in 1990. The signature moment of his autocratic, hands-on leadership style came in 1996 when he personally directed the rescue of 74 hostages held by Tupac Amaru rebels in the Japanese ambassador's residence in Lima. The siege ended with commandoes storming the building, killing all 14 rebels. But his popular support was eroded by lingering poverty, weariness with his autocratic ways and his close ties to his shadowy spymaster Vladimiro Montesinos, who critics charge with corruption and human rights abuses. Many Peruvians felt relief that Fujimori was finally leaving. ``I have been praying to God for Fujimori to go. He has gone but he left behind a country in ruins with people who are hungry, impoverished and without jobs,'' said Patricia Cerna Egoavil, 36, an activist with women's groups. Fujimori and Montesinos had controlled almost all aspects of Peruvian society _ from congress to the courts to television stations _ and his resignation has set off a power struggle to fill the vacuum he leaves. It was the release in September of a videotape apparently showing Montesinos bribing an opposition congressman that launched the scandal that prompted Fujimori's downfall. Fujimori's trip abroad had fueled speculation at home that he would go into exile in Asia.

Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori resigned today. Fujimori ended his ten years of rule in a letter to the Peruvian Congress, saying that he had made mistakes but always acted in Peru's best interests. Fujimori's resignation comes in the middle of a government corruption scandal, in which a top aide was accused of bribing members of Congress for their votes. Fujimori, who is 62, is credited with crushing the two part Kamarau guerilla movement, and helping to reduce Peru's runaway inflation.

This is The World, I am Tony Kahn. It is official, Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori resigned today. The man, who ruled Peru with an iron fist for the last ten years, faxed his resignation from Japan where he had been visiting. Fujimori's surprise decision to step down immediately is the combination of months of political intrigue in Lima. First, Fujimori declared himself the winner in presidential elections last May, then he announced there would be new elections next year and that he would not be a candidate. Now the beleaguered Peruvian strong man is calling it quits. The World's Jennifer Glass reports. Alberto Fujimori's latest announcement further confuses the Peruvian political landscape, already in turmoil. He used a constitutional loophole to run an election eight months ago, winning his third consecutive five-year term. His victory was tainted by allegations of cheating, borne out when a close advisor was caught on video tape, apparently bribing an opposition lawyer to support Fujimori. The Peruvian opposition leader Alejandro Toledo hailed Fujimori's decision to resign immediately. I believe it is the victory for the Democratic forces. It has been a long hard path. Democratic perseverance has prevailed. We have suffered a great deal and there have been moments of solitude, but we have arrived. And now I believe we need to have the political maturity to begin to build a future from today onwards. For now Fujimori remains in Japan, where he is entitled to residency because both his parents were born there. It's unclear whether he will return to Peru, but today the White House said Fujimori will remain in Tokyo indefinitely, according to the Japanese government. Martha Chavez, who has served in Fujimori's governing coalition since 1992, believes Fujimori will return because he is an asset. I have talked with him, he will be back in the moment that it is needed and he will continue to defend all what has been done in these ten years. When Fujimori was elected in 1990, he offered great hope for Peru. He was untainted by political scandal, presided over economic recovery, and stopped the guerilla war waged by the Marxist Shining Path group. But in recent years, Fujimori became increasingly autocratic and his popularity slipped says Colin Harding who edits the Latin American newsletter here in London. Any good he did has at least in part been undone. And many people say that if he had decided not to stand for a third successive term earlier this year, and had just retired into private life, he would have been hailed as one of the greatest Presidents the country has ever had. As it is he is now notorious and regarded as being somebody who overstayed their welcome by a long way. He just couldn't really quit power until it was prized from his grasp. But Harding says Fujimori is an astute politician, who should not be written off. He can always rescue something from however disastrous the situation appears to be, he can always rescue something from it. I wouldn't be surprised that in few months time he is a Senator, you know, back in Peru and in an influential position. At the moment it's hard to see because he is so disgraced and discredited. But it's not impossible and he's done it before, you know, watched his pace. Washington is watching the Peruvian situation closely. It has called for a peaceful, orderly and constitutional transition. A US delegation arrived in Peru today to meet with representatives of the government and the opposition in a nation seen as key to stability in Latin America. For The World, I am Jennifer Glass.

And now a political story that spans two countries and the Pacific Ocean. Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori has resigned, ending a 10-year hold on power. His resignation came in a letter to the Congress from Japan, where he is presently visiting and may remain. During his autocratic rule, Mr. Fujimori scored some successes, but also undermined the country's democracy. From Lima, VOA's Bill Rogers reports on the man vilified by some and revered by others. Born of Japanese immigrants 62 years ago, Mr. Fujimori was a political unknown when he first won the presidency in 1990. A university rector and former mathematics teacher, the man known to his supporters as "El Chino" or the "China man" inherited a bankrupt nation under siege from terrorist attacks by two leftist insurgencies. But it was in these two areas, reviving the economy and combating terrorism, that Mr. Fujimori achieved his greatest successes. In his first five-year term, he enacted reforms that ended rampant inflation and restored economic growth. With a beefed up intelligence service, his government also succeeded in crushing the two guerilla groups that had destabilized the Andean nation. Along the way, however, Mr. Fujimori's autocratic methods began to generate criticism, beginning with his 1992 decision to temporarily dissolve the congress and the courts as a means to combat terrorism. These institutions were reinstated under a revised constitution, but the damage to Mr. Fujimori's democratic credentials had been done. At the same time, there was growing concern over the activities of his intelligence service lead by his shadowy security advisor Vladimiro Montesinos. Under Mr. Montesinos, intelligence agents began undermining the Peruvian leaders political rivals and manipulating the press. Some in the opposition accused Mr. Fujimori of becoming a dictator. British author Sally Bowen who has written a book about the Fujimori government, does not dispute this, but said in a recent interview Mr. Fujimori was a new kind of dictator. I hate to go quite so far that he is dictator, but he is certainly not a democrat. Here they use the expression 'adiksa blanda' instead of 'adiksa dooda', so changing the words dooda hard for blanda soft. So, it's like it's sort of a soft dictatorship. But it was Mr. Fujimori's manipulation of the congress to obtain approval for seeking a third term that began to generate the growing discontent that set the stage for what became a controversial election. Mr. Fujimori won re-election in May, and a vote marred by irregularities, boycotted by the opposition, and condemned by the international community. But despite the disapproval and constant protests, it looked like El Chino would some how manage to serve out his controversial third five year term. But in mid September, a political uproar over a bribery scandal involving Security Chief Montesinos forced Mr. Fujimori to fire his trusted aide and call new elections in which he would not run. His announcement stunned the country and lead to speculation about how much he might have known about the activities of his disgraced spy chief. Author Sally Bowen believes Mr. Fujimori did know quite a bit, and felt he had no choice but to cut short his term. It's clear that he had known all these years, most if not all of what the intelligence service had been up to. I think, the Japanese side comes out in the sense that when it becomes public, when you can't paper over the cracks anymore, when you can't barefacedly deny it any longer, your honor is blown as it were, I suppose the Japanese Samurai would run on his sword and commit hara-kiri, and I mean in the sense that's what Fujimori has done politically. But Mr. Fujimori's hopes of remaining in office until handing over power to an elected successor next July, faded fast as the political opposition gained increasing strength. His power incredibility weakened when Mr. Montesinos return to Peru in October after failing to obtain political asylum in Panama. Mr. Fujimori personally lead the manhunt to capture Mr. Montesinos, but his efforts failed and the ex spy chief's whereabouts are still unknown. Mr. Fujimori's days were numbered when the opposition gained control of the congress last week, and sponsored a resolution to depose the Peruvian leader for moral incapacity. Mr. Fujimori then left Lima for a trip to Asia and announced his decision to resign, from Japan. Again Mr. Fujimori surprised his countrymen, but the move also created indignation even among his closest allies who say he should have returned to Peru to make the announcement. The government's Human Rights ombudsman, Horsches Santi Stevan is among those who believes Mr. Fujimori should not have resigned from abroad. He said Mr. Fujimori is being criticized for not resigning, but for the way he resigned, because it gives the impression he has something to hide by not returning to Peru. In a statement Monday, Mr. Fujimori acknowledged his decision was based on an assessment of the new configuration of political forces in his nation. But he said he is not leaving the presidency to satisfy the demands of any particular person that he resigned, saying instead, he took the decision for the good of the country.

The chancellors of Germany and Austria met Tuesday for the first time since the far-right Freedom Party entered the Austrian government, formally ending a political rift that intensified when Germany backed sanctions against its neighbor. The official meeting between Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder and Austrian Chancellor Wolfgang Schuessel has been touted as a sign of normalizing relations between neighbors with traditionally strong ties. Relations were strained when Germany joined sanctions imposed by European Union countries after the Freedom Party joined Schuessel's centrist Austrian People's Party in government. Joerg Haider, the Freedom Party's best-known figure and its former leader, had long been criticized for remarks made years ago sympathetic toward aspects of the Nazi regime. On Tuesday, Schroeder said his meeting with Schuessel at the sidelines of a business conference was normal, even anti-climatic. ``Since the EU sanctions are over there is not the slightest reason to refuse a meeting,'' Schroeder said during a speech to business leaders. The EU lifted its sanctions after an investigating committee concluded the measures had stoked the very nationalistic fervor they were designed to punish. The two leaders met informally last week at a memorial service in Salzburg, Austria for the 155 people, including 37 Germans, who died in a fire that engulfed a cable car traveling through a mountain tunnel. The meeting in Berlin was arranged at Schuessel's initiative, and Dieter Hundt, the head of Germany's largest employer federation that sponsored the event where the leaders met, said he hoped it would lead to improved relations.

A disgraced President Alberto Fujimori said Tuesday that he would stay in Japan ``for a long time,'' while the leader of Peru's opposition-controlled Congress emerged as his likely successor. After Fujimori's resignation, two of his former allies in line to succeed him stepped aside. That opened the way Tuesday for Valentin Paniagua, a political moderate aligned with the opposition, to become interim president until a new president is sworn in July 28 after April elections. While many Peruvians celebrated at home, Fujimori said he was talking to Japan's Foreign Ministry about staying in his ancestral homeland, though he said he was not seeking political asylum. ``I want to go back (to Peru) someday, but I don't know when,'' Fujimori said Tuesday at a news conference at the Tokyo hotel where he has been holed up. ``I should be here for a long time.'' Fujimori, 62, the Peruvian-born son of Japanese immigrants, had little to say about why he had resigned, saying the reasons would be made public someday. But he insisted his decision to stay in Japan had ``nothing to do with the scandal'' that led to the collapse of his rule. He also denied having bank accounts abroad _ apparently referring to suspicions he was connected to the millions of dollars his former spymaster, Vladimiro Montesinos, allegedly stole from state coffers. Fujimori soared into office 10 years ago in a stunning election upset. He subdued leftist insurgencies and brought economic chaos to heel while imposing an authoritarian rule. His popularity in his third term was eroded by corruption scandals surrounding Montesinos. After he submitted his resignation Monday, Fujimori's jubilant foes cavorted in public fountains or raised signs declaring: ``The people have triumphed, the dictatorship has fallen!'' Congress on Tuesday voted to accept the resignation of First Vice President Francisco Tudela, removing him from the line of succession and opening the way for a vote, expected later in the day, to confirm Paniagua as interim president. Second Vice President Ricardo Marquez _ who would be next in line under the constitution _ resigned several hours after Fujimori, in a bitter statement following opposition pressure. ``Thinking of Peru, and finding myself with dignity in the country where I will remain, I have made the decision to present my irrevocable resignation,'' he said Monday night. Tudela had submitted his resignation Oct. 23 in a protest amid the Montesinos affair, but Congress had not yet formally accepted it. At the Congress session Tuesday, Tudela told lawmakers he was not interested in serving as interim president or running in the special April 8 presidential vote as many had expected he would. ``Paniagua has my vote,'' he said. ``I am not interested in the presidency of the Republic, nor do I suffer from presidential fever.'' Congress then voted to accept his resignation. Peter Romero, U.S. acting assistant secretary of state for western hemisphere affairs, called for an orderly transition after traveling here with a high-level U.S. delegation Monday. ``Our support is for the process and not for any particular person or party,'' he said. It was Montesinos' mid-September appearance in a videotape leaked to the media apparently bribing a newly elected opposition congressman that prompted Fujimori to announce he would step down next July after new elections. In the ensuing scandal, Fujimori _ who won a questionable third five-year term in May, marred by irregularities and fraud allegations _ could not hang on through the transition. ``I have again asked myself about my presence and participation in this transition process and I have come to the conclusion that I should formally resign,'' he wrote in his resignation letter Monday. Lingering poverty, weariness with his autocratic ways and his inability to convince Peruvians that he was knew nothing about Montesinos' reputedly vast network of corruption _ including alleged money laundering, narcotics trafficking and arms dealing _ caught up with Fujimori. ``Let us build a government based on decent institutions, respect for democratic dignity. This is the dream of the Peruvian people,'' said main opposition leader Alejandro Toledo. Opposition lawmakers gained control of Peru's legislature last week for the first time in eight years after Paniagua was successfully voted Congress president. Some said they planned to reject Fujimori's resignation and argue to vote him out of office on constitutional grounds of ``moral incapacity.'' Fujimori had traveled to Japan several times during his presidency and has close ties with the Tokyo government. His son, Hiro, lives in Japan, as do his sister and brother-in-law, who is Peru's ambassador to Tokyo. But Fujimori is not a Japanese citizen. According to Japanese immigration lawyer Naoya Wada, children who are born abroad to Japanese parents retain the right to citizenship automatically only until they turn 22. But Fujimori would likely get favorable treatment if he chose to apply for naturalization, Wada said.

Members of Congress in Peru are debating who should stand in as interim President, that's after Alberto Fujimori resigned over the weekend. Fujimori, who is of Japanese origin, confirmed his decision to resign in a letter sent from Tokyo. He apologized to Peruvians for not declaring his intentions in Peru. I feel very much that my resignation as the President of the Republic of Peru handed down here in Japan, and I feel sorry because of the confusion, uncertainty and indignation caused to the Peruvian population. The man most likely to succeed Fujimori is the speaker of congress Valentine Paniagua. Analysts say he a moderate with wide appeal.

Congress cleared the way Tuesday for its leader, Valentin Paniagua, to succeed Alberto K. Fujimori as president of Peru, vaulting the political opposition to the threshold of power for the first time in more than a decade. It also prepared to vote on whether to accept Fujimori's resignation, submitted earlier this week. Fujimori, his administration upset by corruption scandals in recent months, told reporters in Tokyo on Tuesday that he did not expect to return to Peru ``for a long time.'' In the congressional chamber, with its elegant mahogany balconies, grand arches and huge stained-glass ceiling celebrating republican rule, it was a day of catcalls, boos and emotional speeches. But by Tuesday night the last vestiges of Fujimori's presidency had crumbled and there were some signs that the often fractious political establishment would try to come together to hold new presidential and congressional elections next April. Paniagua, the soft-spoken leader of a small centrist party, seemed unlikely to emerge as anything more than a caretaker president to administer the state until a popularly elected president is inaugurated next July 28. But his sudden rise to replace South America's most authoritarian leader in the next day or so without a bullet being fired marked a new democratic opportunity for a country that has seen far more military coups than successful civilian governments. The 64-year-old Paniagua came to work Tuesday in a gray suit, gray shirt and gray tie, as if to signal that he had no interest in stealing the spotlight from more prominent politicians who will be competing for a full presidential term in the coming months. As president of the Congress, a post he assumed only a week ago, he banged his gavel with equanimity, ensuring that members of Fujimori's party had equal time to speak on the floor. One day after Fujimori tendered his resignation in a letter faxed from Tokyo, members of Congress debated throughout the day whether to accept it or to remove him from office forcibly for ``moral incapacity,'' a move that would open the way for an investigation and possible prosecution. Either way, under Peru's constitution, Fujimori's formal departure, after the resignations of his two vice presidents, places Paniagua next in line to become president. The vote on Fujimori was expected during the night, and Paniagua was expected to be sworn in on Wednesday, congressional leaders said. ``This authoritarian system ends today,'' Manuel Masias Oyanguren of the centrist Somos Peru party told his congressional colleagues. ``Now is the time for dialogue and consensus and a new form of respectful politics.'' Paniagua's emergence as a transitional leader marks at least a pause in six months of political turbulence set off by elections last April and May that were roundly criticized by international observers as tainted by dirty campaign tricks and vote fraud. Within two months of his inauguration to a third five-year term, Fujimori was besieged by a series of scandals involving his intelligence chief, Vladimiro Montesinos. An experienced political juggler who had survived at least one attempted coup, two terrorist rebellions and a war with Ecuador, even Fujimori could not manage to keep his government from unraveling once a videotape was broadcast two months ago showing Montesinos bribing an opposition legislator to switch parties. The broadcast of the tape prompted Fujimori to call new presidential elections and Montesinos fled to Panama in an unsuccessful bid for political asylum. Last month Montesinos returned to Peru, setting off a Keystone Cops-style manhunt led by Fujimori himself. Montesinos remains at large, although there is growing speculation that he has either fled Peru or been killed by former allies afraid he could implicate them in drug dealing or money laundering. Tuesday morning's newspaper headlines were already heralding Paniagua as the new president. The only thing standing in his way was a declaration by First Vice President Francisco Tudela, whose resignation last month had not yet been formally accepted by Congress, that he would be ready to serve as president if Congress wished. But without debate, Congress voted 103-3 Tuesday to accept Tudela's resignation, eliminating him from the running. Because Second Vice President Ricardo Marquez had resigned on Monday, that left Paniagua next in line to succeed Fujimori. As Peruvian television broadcast the congressional proceedings Tuesday, legislators debated the Fujimori legacy. In recent days, many of Fujimori's allies in the Congress had quit his coalition. Many remained silent, angry that he had left the country for an Asia-Pacific summit meeting in Brunei only to resign during what was supposed to be just a stopover in Japan on his return without giving his cabinet more than a few hours notice. But a few legislators reviewed his accomplishments _ the defeat of two brutal terrorist groups, the negotiation of peace with Ecuador, the building of roads and schools in the far reaches of the Andean highlands _ as those of a man who would be remembered favorably by historians. ``Let's not seek revenge,'' said Manuel Vara Ochoa of the Peru 2000 party. ``He was not a criminal. He traveled to the poorest villages to serve the neediest and now he has recognized his errors.'' Many more opposition party members went on the attack, accusing Fujimori and his government of various acts of corruption, gunrunning, torture, manipulation of the courts and running death squads. ``He broke the morality of the country,'' said Daniel Estrada Perez of the Union por El Peru, a center-left party. ``He needs to explain how he could ally himself with a criminal like Montesinos. It is time to recover our ethics.''

An outraged opposition in Congress pushed Tuesday to dismiss President Alberto Fujimori, calling on colleagues to reject his resignation and instead declare him morally unfit for office. Falling into disgrace since his flight last week for Japan, Fujimori said in Tokyo that he planned to stay in his ancestral homeland ``for a long time.'' As the debate raged Tuesday, Congress President Valentin Paniagua, a political moderate with opposition backing, emerged as the likely successor to Fujimori. His appointment was expected to ease the political turmoil set off by a corruption scandal. Fujimori submitted his resignation in a letter sent Monday from Japan. ``The president acknowledges in his letter that he committed errors, but he is not a criminal!'' shouted congressman Manuel Vara Ochoa, a Fujimori loyalist. ``The president ... tirelessly traveled to the most far-flung communities of the country, and those communities _ we should acknowledge _ continue to love the president.'' Most of the lawmakers attacked Fujimori for his conduct. Congress was not contemplating impeachment, a more complex and time consuming process. But Peru's constitution allows lawmakers to dismiss the president for ``moral incapacity'' with a simple majority of the 120-member Congress. A vote was expected later Tuesday. Fujimori, known as ``The Emperor'' for his bulldozer style of government, has even lost the support of some members of his own congressional coalition over his decision to leave the country. ``The country has to say 'enough!' We have to say, here there is clearly moral incapacity and lies,'' said opposition congressman Henry Pease. ``We have struggled against Fujimori for 10 years. We know his successes, but I have to declare as morally unfit someone who lies to the country, who doesn't dare show his face.'' Opposition lawmakers gained control of Peru's legislature last week for the first time in eight years when Paniagua was successfully voted Congress president. Paniagua, 63, was virtually guaranteed to succeed Fujimori because both of Peru's vice presidents had offered their resignations. Under the constitution, the head of Congress is third in line to succeed a president. Fujimori apologized for the ``confusion'' he caused by his resignation, but had little to say about why he decided to step down. ``I want to go back (to Peru) someday, but I don't know when,'' Fujimori told reporters at the Tokyo hotel where he has been holed up. He insisted his decision to stay in Japan had ``nothing to do with the scandal'' that led to the collapse of his rule. The 62-year-old Fujimori, who had declared a war on corruption when he took office in 1990, also denied having bank accounts abroad. He apparently was referring to suspicions he was connected to the millions of dollars his former spymaster, Vladimiro Montesinos, allegedly acquired through money laundering and other illicit activities. Fujimori swept into office 10 years ago in a stunning election upset. A son of Japanese immigrants, he brought a can-do philosophy to the presidency, winning high marks as he defeated leftist insurgencies, eliminated 7,000 percent inflation, brought electricity and water to dirt-poor villages and achieved peace after a brief 1995 border war with Ecuador. But lingering poverty, weariness with his autocratic ways and his inability to persuade Peruvians that he knew nothing about Montesinos' reputedly vast network of corruption _ including alleged money laundering, narcotics trafficking and arms dealing _ finally brought him down.

Outraged lawmakers dismissed President Alberto Fujimori in a raucous session of Congress late Tuesday night, refusing to accept his resignation and declaring him morally unfit for office. Though a political humiliation for the once-powerful leader, the move did nothing to alter the course of presidential succession with Congress President Valentin Paniagua, a political moderate with opposition backing, still expected to replace Fujimori. Paniagua's appointment was expected to ease the political turmoil set off by a corruption scandal that hastened Fujimori's departure. After more than 12 hours of debate, lawmakers voted 62 to nine, with nine abstentions to oust Fujimori on grounds of ``moral incapacity'' as permitted by Peru's constitution. The result in the 120-seat Congress capped an emotional debate in which Fujimori loyalists walked out en masse moments before the vote began. ``The dictatorship has fallen!'' Fujimori critics chanted in Congress, unfurling the red-and-white Peruvian flag from a balcony above the chamber soon after the vote total flashed. Falling into disgrace since his flight last week for Japan, Fujimori said in Tokyo that he planned to stay in his ancestral homeland ``for a long time.'' Fujimori submitted his resignation in a letter sent Monday from Japan. ``The president acknowledges in his letter that he committed errors, but he is not a criminal!'' shouted congressman Manuel Vara Ochoa, a Fujimori loyalist, during the lengthy debate. ``The president ... tirelessly traveled to the most far-flung communities of the country, and those communities _ we should acknowledge _ continue to love the president.''

JERUSALEM (AP) _ U.S. Secretary of Defense William Cohen carried a message to Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak on Wednesday that it's time to end the violence with Palestinians and get back to the bargaining table, Before beginning a private meeting with Cohen, the prime minister thanked the United States for its ``long-term support for the cause of peace and stability'' in the Middle East and for Israel. Cohen responded that he has been meeting with leaders of the Arab world and ``I think all concerned want a secure and lasting peace.'' ``There's a general concern that the violence can spin out of control and we have to get to bargaining and the negotiating table,'' said Cohen. He added that Clinton, in his remaining days in office, has vowed to devote ``all of his energy and support'' to getting the Israelis and the Palestinians back to the negotiating table. ``The United States remains committed to the peace process,'' he said. Cohen was returning to the United States after his meeting with Barak. Barak said U.S. support has made ``a strong, self-confident Israel that can stand here and as a result of being strong enough, be able to be restrained at the same time.'' He thanked Cohen in particular for support Israel missile defense system intended to protect the country's northern region. Cohen flew directly to Israel after meeting in Cario earlier Wednesday with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and reporting that Egypt would consider returning its ambassador to Israel if the violence stops between the Palestinians and Israelis. Even as Cohen was meeting with Mubarak, then Barak, violence continued in the region. Four Palestinians were killed by Israeli troops near a Jewish settlement, with each side blaming the other for provoking a confrontation. Cohen said Mubarak told him Egypt wants to remain part of the peace process, but that he needs time to consult with the ambassador. ``He indicated that he needed to call him back for consultations and that the period has not set when he would go back,'' said Cohen. ``The conditions had to be such that he could return. He hoped that could take place in the future, but there has to be a cessation of the violence.'' The Egyptian president recalled his ambassador from Tel Aviv earlier this week for an unspecified period of consultation in Cairo. The ambassador, Mohammed Bassiouny, left the Egyptian Embassy in Tel Aviv on Wednesday morning, saying farewell to the staff, and then headed to the Israeli-Egyptian border by car, embassy officials said. Cohen said Mubarak told him ``he hopes the message could be very clear that both sides have to stop the riots'' and that he hoped the ambassador could return ``as soon as possible,'' but emphasized that that the violence must cease before that happens. ``He was willing to continue his efforts'' to work for peace, but is worried that violence could spread around the Middle East, Cohen said. ``He believes it is imperative that both side stop the violence and that they have to get back to the bargaining table,'' Cohen said. Interviewed Tuesday by the Egyptian television show ``Good Morning Egypt,'' Cohen said that, notwithstanding the concerns of Arab countries, the United States has a balanced policy that seeks to stop the violence on both sides. Cohen, on a tour of the Middle East and Persian Gulf, was responding to a question on whether the United States believes that Israeli lives are more important than Palestinian and whether the United States is more conscious in warning Israel to stop the violence. ``All lives are precious in the eyes of the United States,'' Cohen said. ``We want to stop the violence on both sides.'' ``We want a just and lasting and fair peace. We want to see the killing stopped on both sides.'' Cohen said Israel is a ``strong country that needs to be strong for its own security,'' but noted that the United States also provides Egypt with some $1.3 billion in military assistance each year and the Clinton administration has proposed $225 million in additional funds in a supplemental appropriations bill. ``Egypt has been a very strong partner for peace,'' Cohen said. Cohen, asked whether he would accept another Cabinet position no matter who wins the presidency, said he would not but instead wants to complete a novel on international intrigue that he began writing six years ago. Meanwhile, Pentagon chief spokesman Kevin Bacon, said the USS Hawes, a fast frigate, will be passing through the Suez Canal, the first U.S. warship to go through the waterway since the Oct. 12 bombing of the USS Cole in Yemen.

Little known outside his country, new President Valentin Paniagua has drafted some high-powered help in the daunting task of erasing the vestiges of 10 years of autocratic rule. Former U.N. Secretary-general Javier Perez de Cuellar, Peru's most illustrious son, was tapped Wednesday to be the country's prime minister and to help heal the wounds left by the ouster of Alberto Fujimori. Tarred by a mounting corruption scandal that plunged Peru into a deep political crisis, Fujimori fled the country last week, disgraced and dismissed by lawmakers who declared him morally unfit for office. Fujimori, the son of Japanese immigrants, fled to Japan, where he says he plans to stay indefinitely. But analysts say the 64-year-old Perez de Cuellar's impeccable democratic credentials lend credibility to an interim government whose mandate is to deliver free and fair elections April 8 and turn power over to a new president next July. There was a general sense of optimism here Wednesday as Paniagua, a congressman and leader of a small centrist party, was sworn in to replace Fujimori. ``Democracy undoubtedly has a future here,'' said Luis Pezzoriti, 42, an architect. ``Democracy in Peru over the past decade had been distorted. There basically was a civilian dictatorship.'' The teaming of Paniagua, known in Peruvian political circles as an honest consensus builder, with Perez de Cuellar, an internationally lauded diplomat who personally negotiated the 1987 cease-fire in the Iran-Iraq war, drew a positive response from many Peruvians. ``The economic situation, the lack of work, has left us sad and basically abandoned,'' said Roberto Tello, a 64-year-old salesman. ``We have hope with this new government, even though it's transitional, that things will get better.'' In a radio interview from France, where he lives most of the year, Perez de Cuellar said he had accepted Paniagua's offer to be Peru's prime minister hours before Paniagua took the oath of office in Congress. The 80-year-old career diplomat, who lost a presidential bid against Fujimori in 1995, said he would be back in Peru by Friday to begin working with Paniagua on a new Cabinet. The challenge, he said, would be finding the most capable people, ``with total independence to avoid as much as possible interference of political interests.'' Analysts said Perez de Cuellar's appointment would help open doors in the international community, as well as bridge the bitter political divide between former government loyalists and opposition leaders at home. Fujimori, who won a third five-year term in May elections marred by fraud allegations, saw his iron grip on power broken by a corruption scandal involving his top aide and spy chief, Vladimiro Montesinos. It was the security adviser's appearance in a videotape apparently bribing an opposition congressman that prompted Fujimori's announcement in September that he would call new elections and step down next year. But as the scandal grew, Fujimori submitted his resignation in a letter sent Monday from Japan. Lawmakers refused to accept his resignation, instead opting to dismiss him in a raucous session of Congress late Tuesday night. Still in hiding, Montesinos leaves behind a network of alleged money laundering, narcotics trafficking and influence peddling that investigators say stretches deep into all of Peru's democratic institutions. Paniagua has the mandate of those who vaulted him into the presidency to root out Montesinos' deep-seated influence. But perhaps his greatest challenge will be restoring credibility to the country's tattered democracy. ``Paniagua is honest. He doesn't have any scandals on his political record,'' said Luis Jochamowitz, a historian and author of a biography of Fujimori. ``The election of Paniagua is a prize for his loyalty to the party system after a 10-year period in which the past administration vilified professional politicians, whether they were good or bad.''

One of the suicide bombers believed to have carried out last month's attack on the USS Cole is linked to the 1998 bombings of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, a Yemeni source close to the investigation said Thursday. The connection was made after a composite sketch of one of the two suspected suicide bombers appeared to match that of a man wanted for questioning in connection with the bombings of the embassies in Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, the source said. The bombings killed 224 people. A senior U.S. law enforcement official in the United States declined to comment on the reported resemblance, but did say that since the beginning of the Cole investigation there have been a number of threads that appear to link the Cole case to the earlier bombings in East Africa. After months of careful planning, two suicide bombers on Oct. 12 brought a small boat laden with explosives alongside the Cole and detonated it while the ship was refueling in the Yemeni port of Aden. The explosion killed 17 U.S. sailors and injured 39. Over the past couple of days, U.S. investigators in Aden have attended some of the interrogations of the six main suspects, said the Yemeni source, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The United States is pressing Yemeni authorities to allow U.S. agents a greater role in the investigation. They have already been allowed to question eyewitnesses. Investigators have focused on Muslim extremists angered by the U.S. military presence in the Arabian Peninsula, especially Saudi Arabia. U.S. investigators have said the attack bears the earmarks of followers of Osama bin Laden, the exiled Saudi millionaire and Afghanistan war veteran whom officials say ordered the East Africa bombings.

American businessman Edmond Pope got a brief break from his Moscow espionage trial Thursday when the judge cut short hearings so that he could observe Thanksgiving. Pope, accused of seeking classified plans for a high-speed torpedo, spent the morning in the suspects' cage in a Moscow courtroom, as he has throughout the monthlong, closed-door trial. ``He wasn't in a holiday mood,'' defense attorney Pavel Astakhov said. After he returned to Lefortovo prison in the afternoon, a U.S. consular officer was to bring him some turkey, Astakhov said. But the officer was refused access to Pope, a U.S. Embassy official said. Consular officials have been allowed to meet with Pope only on a few occasions since his April arrest. The defense marked a small victory Thursday morning when Judge Nina Barkina threw out one volume of documents of the eight-volume indictment. Astakhov said the documents were related to witnesses who have not been called to testify in court. Barkina has turned down most of the defense's motions, and a defense effort to have her removed from the case Wednesday was rejected. Among the witnesses whose testimony was thrown out was U.S. researcher Daniel H. Kiely, who was arrested along with Pope. Kiely, head of energy and power systems at Pennsylvania State University's Applied Research Laboratory, was released after being questioned by Russian authorities and says he knows nothing about the alleged purchase of secret data. Pope's supporters say the plans he was seeking were already sold abroad and weren't classified. One of Pope's key accusers has recanted a statement that implicated him in espionage. But a government commission concluded that the plans, parts of which Pope received before his arrest, were in fact classified. Pope, 54, of State College, Pa., is a retired U.S. Navy officer and founder of CERF Technologies International, a company specializing in studying foreign maritime equipment. The U.S. government has urged Russia to release Pope, saying Russian authorities have failed to show he did anything illegal, and because of his health. His family fears that Pope's bone cancer, which was in remission when he came to Moscow, may have returned.

Peru has a new President whom you've probably never heard of. Valentin Paniagua and a new Prime Minister who is more familiar, former UN Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar . The two leaders, who took office this week, face a daunting task to erase the wastages of Alberto Fujimori's 10 years of autocratic rule. Fujimori fled Peru and the mounting corruption scandal last week. He is now in Japan where he says he plans to stay indefinitely. But the Japanese, as the BBC's Charles Scandlin reports, have mixed feelings about hosting the former Peruvian President. After spending five days under tight security at a Tokyo hotel, Alberto Fujimori is on the move once again. Embassy officials would only say that he had gone to stay with friends. His long-term plans remain unclear. But he said he does want to remain in Japan for the time being. The Japanese media have been following Mr. Fujimori's movements closely. He is very well known in Japan. His election as President of Peru ten years ago caused a sensation here and he has made at least one trip a year to the country since then. Mr. Fujimori arrived in Tokyo last Friday in what seemed to be a stopover from a summit meeting in Brunei. Officials first said he was here to negotiate a loan and then said he was staying on because of illness. But Mr. Fujimori's true intentions became known at the weekend when he announced his resignation. "I have my reasons for taking this action and they might be difficult to understand," he told reporters, "but I am no longer a President, just an ordinary citizen". Mr. Fujimori's decision to stay in Japan puts the government in an embarrassing position. Officials say they will consider a request to extend his stay, but Japan has no provision for political asylum. And not all Japanese would agree with the decision to let him settle here. The reason, I cannot understand his reasons why he stayed in Japan because I think he should go back, I think. So that is my point. He has some responsibilities to say something to Peruvian people, I think. Yes, I think he can stay here because he is Japanese, he has Japanese ancestor and I think he has a right. Much of the debate hinges on the true nature of Mr. Fujimori's links with Japan. His parents immigrated from the Southern island of Kyushu in the 1930s, but they still registered his birth at the Japanese Embassy in Lima. That could entitle him to Japanese citizenship and would certainly make it easier for the authorities to grant him residency. Japan will be anxious not to offend the new administration in Lima, but it maintained extremely close ties with the Fujimori governments, lavishing economic aid on Peru after his election. But it may feel it owes him a debt of gratitude for his efforts to end the siege of the Japanese Embassy in 1996 when it was taken over by left wing guerillas. The BBC's Charles Scandlin reporting from Tokyo, Japan.

This is The World, the co-production of the BBC World service, PRI and WGBH in Boston. I am Tony Kahn. It has been more than two weeks since our presidential election and we still don't have a winner. Don't look for any such confusion over the outcome of this Sunday's election though in Haiti. Jean-Bertrand Aristide is almost certain to return to the Presidency. The former firebrand Roman Catholic priest was a populist hero when he first rose to power ten years ago but he is no hero in Washington as The World's Jeb Sharp reports. Haiti started out as one of President Clinton's foreign policy successes. It was Clinton who in 1994 sent US troops to restore Jean-Bertrand Aristide to power after Haiti's first democratically elected President was overthrown in a military coup. Once he was reinstated, Arestied governed until 1996 when he had to step down again because Haiti's constitution does not allow its President to serve consecutive terms. Since then he has been running the country from behind the scenes and waiting to make his comeback but the nature of that comeback is problematic, according to Don Steinberg the State Department's special Haiti coordinator. Arestied by all accounts is the single most popular figure in Haiti, but that's not enough. There has to be a clean free and fair democratic election. Under the current circumstances we doubt that, that can take place. Those circumstances stem from flawed legislative election last May. According to Rachel Neil, a Haiti expert at the Washington office on Latin America. Turn up actually was very good and most observers agree that Arestied's party Sami Lavela has won overwhelmingly. Unfortunately you know a clear win wasn't enough for them, they wanted everything uncheated on the vote count. The United States and international organizations refused to recognize the compromise results of that election and demanded that Arestied's party and the opposition resolve their differences before going ahead with Sunday's presidential election. But negotiations have failed to produce an agreement and the Arestied controlled election board is pressing ahead. Rachel Neil says rushing the election will leave Arestied with a shaky mandate if he becomes President. On the one hand I think Arestied being back in the presidency is actually in many ways a good thing. It is better for him to be clearly responsible and accountable for his actions rather than this sort of shadowy figure behind the scenes. On the other hand, he is going to be ruling with very questionable legitimacy and I think is going to be in a very delicate position, vis a vis both his own people in Haiti who I doubt will give him a tremendously long honeymoon period. And vis a vis the international community. Arestied has certainly complicated his relationship with the United States by thumbing his nose at the international community. Without free and fair elections, the United States cannot give aid to Areistid's government. It must channel all its assistance through the private sector and cannot officially recognize the new Parliament. But the State Department's Don Steinberg says US officials have no intention of abandoning Haiti. We are in a situation where democratic principles need to be established, where human rights need to be respected, where the crushing poverty, the worst in the western hemisphere needs to be alleviated in terms of improving health care, education, housing. US officials are also worried Haiti's political and economic troubles will generate a fresh wave of refugees on US shores and they are keenly aware that an estimated 14 percent of the cocaine reaching the United States transits through Haiti. But fixing Haiti's problems won't be easy. Observers describe a strongman political culture that Arestied has so far failed to change. Johny McCallah of the National Center for Haitian Rights in New York says Haiti's future looks bleak. I, like many other people, had great hopes. We struggled for democracy and human rights. We tried to help shape and fashion a judicial system that would be worthy of the name, but our efforts seem to have been in vain. No one has much optimism about Haiti these days. If Arestied is elected as expected on Sunday he will have much to prove. The country is impoverished, its infrastructure is in tatters and political violence and drug trafficking are on the rise. If Arestied fails to rein in these problems, Haiti risks becoming a periled state. If he begins to tackle them he may win back the outside help he so surely needs. For The World I am Jeb Sharp.

The Voice of America presents differing points of view on a wide variety of issues. Next, an editorial expressing the policies of the United States government. The years of animosity are past. That was President Bill Clinton's message to the people of Vietnam during his recent visit. "Today we have a shared interest in your prosperity", said Mr. Clinton. "We have a stake in your future and we wish to be your partners. We wish you success". President Clinton's visit represents a watershed in US-Vietnam relations. In the 1960's and early 1970's, the US fought a protracted war, aimed at preventing South Vietnam from being absorbed by communist North Vietnam. Some 58,000 Americans died in this effort which ultimately proved unsuccessful. In addition to those killed in Vietnam, many other Americans were held as prisoners of war or listed as missing in action. Improvement in US-Vietnam relations has depended on progress in accounting for those Americans listed as missing. Based on such progress, the US in 1994 lifted its trade embargo on Vietnam. A year later the US and Vietnam established normal diplomatic relations. The value of open markets and respect for human rights were the principle themes of President Clinton's talks with the Vietnamese Communist Party General Secretary Lay Kaffu and others, including Roman Catholic Archbishop Joan Baptist Fa Mei Man. Mr. Clinton recognized the progress that Vietnam has made in some areas. But he said that greater openness and greater freedom would speed the country's development. Vietnam has taken steps to open its economy and trade with the US has grown as a result. An agreement signed in September is expected to expand trade further. But success will depend on the extent to which Vietnam embraces entrepreneurship, innovation and competition. "We have a bright future", said President Clinton, "that we can build together to liberate our people and their potential".

Negotiators met behind guarded doors late Friday night, trying to reach a consensus on a global warming treaty before their meeting breaks up on Saturday. ``For the environment, it doesn't get any bigger than this,'' said Jennifer Morgan, the climate-change specialist for the World Wildlife Fund, as she caught delegates on the way into the negotiating room for a last bit of arm twisting. On Thursday, Jan Pronk, the overseer of the two-week meeting and the Dutch environment minister, had lowered expectations a notch, saying there would doubtless be issues that would be delayed and text that would remain unwritten. The next meetings are already scheduled, for May in Germany and for October in Morocco. But he and many participants said there was a decent chance that a general declaration of success was within reach by Saturday morning. The proposed treaty, the Kyoto Protocol, was drafted by more than 170 countries in 1997, and the session here was intended to flesh out the details. If enacted, the treaty would commit three dozen industrial countries to cut their greenhouse-gas emissions by 2012 at least 5 percent below the levels in 1990. So far, no industrial countries have ratified the pact. An agreement, according to many delegates and scientists gathered here, could be a first tentative step away from an age built on combustion of fossil fuels, which has flooded the atmosphere with heat-trapping greenhouse gases, and toward economies that are more in balance with global ecology. Any success would inevitably be a result of big compromises on dozens of fronts, given the competing and contradictory situations of many countries that are taking part in the discussions. Cloistered in the Van Gogh hall at the Netherlands Congress Center were representatives of tiny low-lying countries vulnerable to the rising seas that would be expected in a warmer world; of some countries where crops might flourish in a warmer world and others whose crops might wilt; of countries cloaked in forests that can absorb carbon dioxide and help them cut emissions; and of countries whose fortunes are derived from coal or oil, fuels that would lose favor and cost more should the treaty take force. As a result of this diversity, private environmental groups saw two possible outcomes. One would be a landmark success, in the form of effective, enforceable rules for cutting emissions of warming greenhouse gases. The other would be a wrenching failure, should the treaty lack clear language calling for strategies that cut emissions without creating other ecological trouble. On Friday, countries and alliances that had been giving daily news conferences canceled all such sessions, with the action moving into cubicles and offices. No one seemed satisfied with the latest treaty summary. Frank E. Loy, the chief U.S. negotiator, communicated only by a printed statement, in which he said he was ``deeply disappointed'' with the document, but added that ``the situation is fluid'' and that negotiations would press ahead. And within the environmental movement, there were passionate divisions. Some people said the treaty, as proposed, failed to give credit for preserving tropical forests as a ``sink'' for carbon dioxide. Others objected to that idea, saying any credit for forest projects would take away the incentive for cutting the emissions that caused the problem. Morgan said success would lie in the strength of the consensus and its power to motivate action now to start curtailing the human impact on the atmosphere. ``What we're looking for is a signal to businesses and countries that they need to start changing,'' Morgan said. In the end, the prospect of a climate treaty was creating unlikely alliances, with some businesses that had long been seen as enemies of the environment aligning themselves with conservation groups. Among those at the sessions calling for clear rules and strong penalties was Dale E. Heydlauff, senior vice president for environmental affairs of American Electric Power, a $12-billion-a-year energy company that has for decades wrestled with environmentalists over clean-air laws. ``Environmental groups and industry both need strong, effective compliance mechanisms, because otherwise this treaty is a fraud,'' he said. Tooker Gomberg, an environmental campaigner from Ontario, blasted a shrill note on a pocket trumpet in the press room, resulting in a stampede of television crews and reporters. He took out his passport and a cigarette lighter. ``Tonight I am ashamed to be Canadian,'' Gomberg said. ``My country is the worst country here at The Hague.'' With a flick of his thumb, the passport blossomed into flames. ``Some people think this conference is an exercise in politics, diplomacy and compromise,'' he said. ``The only thing being compromised here is the integrity of the biosphere.'' Eventually the halls grew quiet as aides and advisers retreated to hotels. They were useless until dawn, because their bosses were locked away with Pronk. One young man played a harmonica in a corner.

High-stakes negotiations aimed at finishing a treaty to curb global warming broke down Saturday after a tense all-night bargaining session that foundered on last-minute disputes between European and U.S. negotiators. The breakdown, after two weeks of intensive talks here, stunned many participants and observers, even though they had recognized from the start the enormity of trying to find common ground on ways to cut the greenhouse gases emitted by every smokestack and tailpipe from Boston to Brisbane. ``I'm gutted,'' said John Prescott, Britain's deputy prime minister, as he left the hall Saturday morning after failing to negotiate a compromise between the United States _ by far the world's largest producer of greenhouse gases _ and some of its allies and the European Union. But Jan Pronk, the conference president and Dutch environment minister, did not concede defeat, and instead proposed that the meeting be suspended, with another session perhaps as soon as May. The top U.S. negotiator, Frank E. Loy, visibly tired and rubbing his forehead and eyes, agreed the effort should continue, even if he and the Clinton administration would be handing over the task to a new administration. ``We will not give up,'' Loy said. ``The stakes are too high, the science too decisive, and our planet and our children too precious.'' From the outset the talks were riven by conflicting agendas. Poor countries sought billions of dollars in payments to help them adapt to climate change. Rich countries sought to blunt the impact of emission reductions on their economies by finding the least costly ways to cut warming gases, including planting forests as ``sinks'' to absorb carbon dioxide, the dominant greenhouse gas. But on this day it came down to the disputes between industrial powers on opposite sides of the Atlantic, and a persistent disagreement over the role of trees and properly managed farmland in absorbing carbon dioxide. The lack of understanding on that issue was a key to the breakdown Saturday, negotiators on both sides said, with European negotiators rejecting a compromise proposal as too harmful to the environment and too favorable to the United States. The treaty they had been hoping to finish, called the Kyoto Protocol, was drafted by more than 170 countries in 1997 in Japan, and this session was intended to flesh out the details. If enacted, it would commit three dozen industrialized countries to cut their greenhouse-gas emissions by 2012 to at least 5 percent below what emissions were in 1990. So far, no industrialized country has ratified the pact. When the treaty was drafted three years ago, the United States, Canada and other large countries said they would seek credit toward their emission targets for forested areas, but those talks never settled on an amount. Negotiators at the current conference had hoped to arrive at one. But no agreement could be reached. A British official, who declined to be identified, said that many European countries realized the significance of these sinks only at this meeting _ and that was far too late. Part of the problem was also a cultural rift, negotiators on both sides said. The European Union, where Green Party politics is a driving force, never found a way to compromise with the United States, where the environmental movement is increasingly working with industries to influence change, instead of fighting for strict top-down regulations. ``It's extremely difficult to negotiate between groups where political cultures are so different,'' Dominique Voynet, the French environment minister and a Green Party member, told the plenary sessions. Around 3 a.m., Prescott, from Britain, and representatives of two other European countries met with the U.S. team over a proposal. Members of both delegations said agreement was reached in that room, but when that set of proposals was brought back to the rest of the European delegation, they rejected it. ``We had a hard and fast political deal,'' said a member of the British delegation, who spoke on condition of anonymity. But that deal could not hold up to the subsequent analysis before dawn by other countries in the European Union. There was plenty of blame to go around. Moments after word escaped of the impasse, representatives of competing factions of private environmental groups held briefings for the press, shouting to be heard over the din and confusion. Within moments, their representatives sprinted around the halls, decrying the failure and saying simply ``It's over,'' as they handed out hastily printed press releases. ``The United States pushed too hard and too far,'' said Jennifer Morgan, climate campaign director for the World Wildlife Fund, which joined a mostly European cluster of organizations. ``They didn't leave the time or trust to get a deal in the end.'' Other environmental groups that tend to work with industry expressed just as much dismay at the outcome but defended the U.S. position, which focused on building a political consensus back in the United States by making sure the agreement satisfied industry and farming groups. ``In the long-term fight against global warming we need every tool at our disposal,'' said Eileen Claussen, president of the Pew Center on Global Climate Change, a Washington group. Claussen previously was part of a Clinton administration team that negotiated agreements leading up to the Kyoto Protocol. ``If we take carbon sequestration and market mechanisms out of the equation, or bog them down with such overly restrictive rules that nobody uses them,'' she said, ``then we are limiting our ability to meet our environmental objectives.'' A pair of staff members for two senators, one a Democrat and one a Republican, said that all was not lost, despite the substantial setback. The Senate had strong reservations about the Kyoto Protocol even before it was negotiated in 1997. But there was now the prospect of a new push in Washington on action to curb greenhouse gases, they said. ``Regardless of the outcome here, the stage is set in Congress next year to consider addressing this issue in a way that makes economic and environmental sense in a coordinated fashion,'' one of the staff members said. Late in the afternoon, the leaders of the conference returned to the red chairs on the main podium and swiftly found agreement on one thing: the venue and schedule for the next official session, in Marrakesh, Morocco, next October.

Broken promises made in fading industrial cities like this are causing both the left and right to surge in Romanian politics. In the presidential election on Sunday, Ion Iliescu, the 70-year-old former Communist who was president from 1990 to 1996, is expected to make a comeback with about 40 percent of the vote, then face a runoff on Dec. 10. More surprising to political analysts, polls show Corneliu Vadim Tudor, whose brand of nationalism is just beginning to go out of style in neighboring Yugoslavia, headed for second place. Tudor is shoving aside the coalition of centrists who have run this devastated country since 1996 but failed to fix the economy because of bickering and now cannot unite behind one candidate. Tudor is a senator, poet and magazine owner who has written anti-Hungarian, anti-Semitic and anti-Gypsy tracts, and talked of ending corruption ``with a Kalashnikov'' and of uniting ``Greater Romania.'' There is little suggestion that voters endorse such right-wing ideas. But Romanians are monumentally frustrated. Eleven years after the collapse of communism and the personality cult of Nicolae Ceausescu, they live in the second biggest country in Eastern Europe after Poland, but are virtually last in line to join the European Union. Living standards are edging toward those of India or Africa: 40 percent of the population lives on less than $35 a month. The lei, which was 21 to the dollar when Ceausescu was executed, is now 25,000 to the dollar. In a population of 23 million, there are 6 million retirees and only 4.3 million registered workers supporting them. Between 25 and 40 percent of the economy goes untaxed. The young flee west. In Craiova, the Heavy Machine Tool Factory has laid off 6,200 of the 7,000 who used to work inside. Other factories making train engines, agricultural vehicles and Daewoo cars are suffering similar fates. The afternoon shift change disgorged a trickle of workers. ``It has become very tough,'' said Dumitru Popa, 40. ``We don't have much work to do, and we're doing more starving than eating.'' From the politicians, he said, ``it's all lies.'' ``But Iliescu,'' he said, ``is probably the most popular because he's more charismatic.'' Iliescu, cheerful and sometimes teased by his nickname ``Granny,'' still draws crowds of elderly women who kiss his car and workers who like his pledges of better pensions and no more layoffs. He was a popular first-term president, the head of the National Salvation Front, which assumed power during the confused street fighting that toppled Ceausescu. But he could never bring himself to close the dying state-owned factories or sell failing banks. A center-right coalition led by Emil Constantinescu, a university professor, ousted him, promising to do just that and push for European Union integration. But the coalition fell apart, amid constant bickering. Corruption, a perennial problem, appears to have been the main undoing of Constantinescu. In July, he refused to seek a second term, saying he was disgusted at the greed that blocked his reforms. The week before last, he got specific: 30,000 tons of fuel oil was illegally shipped to neighboring Yugoslavia in breach of the international embargo with the connivance of the border police and transport ministry, he said. Embezzlement of public funds was as routine as cigarette and coffee smuggling. ``If we continue to break laws and if theft, crime and lies continue to proliferate, then any investments or support through international programs are in vain,'' he said. Haphazard privatizations have hurt consumers: phone bills soared after a Greek telephone company bought Romania's telephone company and a private monopoly replaced a public one. Ensuing anger has opened the way for Tudor. His older ideas about taking back lands that now lie outside Romania's borders _ Moldavia and Bessarabia _ excite few, and only lunatics want war with Hungary over Transylvania, which for centuries was part of the Hungarian empire and still houses a substantial Hungarian minority. But Tudor's plans to recentralize the economy, establish price controls and ``liquidate the business Mafia'' do strike chords. He is also quick-witted _ in the last presidential debate, his arguments with a pompous moderator stole the show. A showman with a sense of history, he dismissed Sweden's $3 billion unpaid-loan claim, a debate point, by saying Romania fed a lost Swedish army for five years after it was trounced by Russia in 1729, which should cancel the debt. Iliescu skipped the last debate, as if he had already won. The centrist candidates, Prime Minister Mugur Isarescu, Foreign Minister Petre Roman, former Prime Minister Theodor Stolojan, and former Foreign Minister Teodor Melescanu, are all respected _ but indistinguishable _ political leaders. Dorel Sandor, a political analyst, said that Roman, for example, is respected by intellectuals and the young; his fluency in English, French and Spanish help make him Romania's best-known political face abroad. But like the other centrist technocrats, Sandor said, ``he appears not to be credible in his concern about poor people _ and they are the majority.'' Iliescu appeals to 15 million struggling voters because he is still a populist, Tudor because he is a nationalist who has tempered his anti-NATO, anti-Europe stance. ``It's an anti-democratic trend, but the poor have to live,'' Sandor said. The top issues in the election, said Alin Teodorescu, a market survey specialist, are inflation, sinking standards of living, corruption, and health and education. The issues on the mind of the West _ polluted rivers and European Union standards _ are well down the list. Transitions Online, a web magazine covering Eastern Europe, predicted a comeback by Iliescu the week before last and used as a title the response a schoolboy once had to give to each stroke of the cane: ``Thank you, sir. May I have another?''

A U.N. climate conference collapsed without an agreement Saturday, the conference chairman announced after a failed all-night negotiating session on how to cut the pollution that is warming the planet. ``We have not reached agreement,'' Dutch Environment Minister Jan Pronk said. ``I am very disappointed.'' Pronk's announcement came after an unsuccessful marathon session behind closed doors with delegation leaders representing 180 countries. When that failed, Pronk held a last-minute meeting in his office with government ministers to try to salvage the talks _ to no avail. Pronk said he was not closing the conference but would resume it at a later stage. ``We cannot go home just by stating, by confessing, that we did not reach an agreement,'' he said. ``We should be aware that we have been watched by the outside world,'' he told the delegates in a closing plenary. ``There were extremely high expectations of us.'' Some lobbyists from environmental groups broke into tears as they watched Pronk speak. The negotiators broke off talks nearly 12 hours after going into seclusion to try to nail down details on the extent to which countries may meet their targets for reductions of greenhouse gas emissions without actually burning less fossil fuel. A key issue blocking agreement was that of ``sinks'' _ whether to let countries count the carbon absorbed by their forests against their greenhouse gas emissions. U.S. officials say nations should get credit for existing farmland and forests because they absorb carbon dioxide and offset some emissions. Opponents say such programs would reward certain countries for doing nothing. ``Governments have spent two weeks essentially arguing about how they can do as little as possible to reduce the threat of global climate change,'' said Tony Juniper, vice chairman of Friends of the Earth. The environmental group Greenpeace said the meeting ``will be remembered as the moment when governments abandoned the promise of global cooperation to protect the planet Earth.'' A U.S. official said an accord between U.S. negotiators and a delegation representing the 15-nation European Union had wrapped up an accord on the ``sinks'' issue early Saturday. But other European delegations rejected the accord, and the agreement went ``into limbo,'' the official said on condition of anonymity. French Environment Minister Dominique Voynet said the positions of the United States and the Europeans were ``radically antagonistic,'' and even after lengthy negotiations, the stands were ``a repetition in various forms of the original positions.'' She said the European Union would submit a proposal to break the deadlock within two months. Undersecretary of State Frank Loy, the chief U.S. negotiator, pledged to continue later where the talks left off. ``An agreement on key issues was close at hand, and maybe can be pursued to completion,'' he said in a speech to the plenary. ``Failure is not an option. The stakes are too high.'' Nigerian delegate Sani Zangon Daura, speaking for the developing countries, said the talks broke down over arguments among the wealthier nations. ``We are really disappointed by the non-agreement purely based on really selfishness and lack of political will in particular from the north,'' he said. The U.S. official said the provisional agreement reached early in the morning included measures on enforcing reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, counting sinks to offset emissions targets, and on what portion of a country's target may be met by international emissions trading. The French-led delegation agreed in principle to let the United States, Canada and Japan subtract the tons of carbon soaked up in their forests against the emissions quota, after the U.S. negotiators agreed to a lower figure. But that agreement was vetoed by the German delegation when the EU countries discussed the accord among themselves. ``This is likely to have been the European nations' best opportunity to achieve a strong climate treaty, and they decided to pass it up,'' said the National Environment Trust, a U.S.-based lobby. But business groups which had opposed emissions controls applauded the breakdown, which they said ``signals the need for a new approach to address concerns about the climate.'' Under the Kyoto Protocol, worldwide emissions of heat-trapping gases must decline to 5.2 percent below their 1990 levels by 2012. Much of the controversy at the conference surrounded the U.S.-sponsored proposals under which countries could earn credit toward their emissions-reduction targets without directly scaling back the burning of fossil fuels. In addition to the sinks issue, the U.S. delegation proposed an open-ended market system of credit trading between countries that reduce emissions over and above targets and those that cannot meet their targets _ a system that worked well in reducing acid rain in the United States.

Surrounded by heavily armed police, Jean-Bertrand Aristide got out of a car, knelt, clasped his hands in prayer and kissed the ground where a young boy was killed by a pipe bomb. Then his guards hustled him back into the car, settling him behind its black tinted windows. Aristide's first public appearance since registering to run Oct. 9 took less than a minute on Friday, two days before Haiti's Sunday presidential election. And few people saw the man set to return to power in Haiti break his reclusive habit. The several hundred supporters who were on hand were showered by hundreds of leaflets dropped from a passing plane, each one showing Aristide with arms outstretched like a savior. In an atmosphere of fear and terror as palpable as the pervasive dust here, Haitians are expected to vote back into office their first freely elected president, the populist and charismatic former priest toppled in a 1991 military coup and returned by a U.S. invasion in 1994. Because the constitution does not allow consecutive terms in office, Aristide stepped down in 1996, making way for this troubled Caribbean nation's first democratic handover of power in its 200-year history. His promises this time around include a far-fetched pledge to create half a million jobs in Haiti, where only one in three workers is employed and most people are preoccupied with the daily struggle to find food. ``After 200 years of political and economic violence, we have decided to choose peace,'' Aristide said in a radio message urging Haitians to vote. ``Too much misery, too much insecurity, too much bloodshed. Enough is enough.'' But the joy and hope that accompanied Aristide's first election are markedly absent this time. All the major opposition parties are boycotting, charging that this year's legislative elections were rigged to favor Aristide's candidates and that Haiti is sliding back into dictatorship. In what some critics call a farce of democracy, Aristide is running against six unknowns who, fearful of attacks, have not campaigned. Nine senators also will be elected. Aristide's Lavalas Family party is expected to make a clean sweep. In May, it won 17 of the remaining 18 Senate seats and 80 percent of the House of Assembly. International calls for runoff elections have gone unheeded, as have warnings of aid cutoffs. ``We won't participate in an election masquerade. ... People who vote will vote for the death of democracy,'' opposition parties said in a message broadcast on radio. Miriam Jean, who sells rice and corn meal from a basket, called it her duty to vote. ``We believe in Aristide. We believe he will keep his promises,'' she said. But not many others were expected to cast ballots Sunday. More than 4 million voters are registered but, in an indication of the apathy, of an estimated 800,000 Haitians who turned 18 in recent months, only 125,000 have registered. ``The best thing people can do Sunday will be to stay in bed,'' said Jean's friend, Ghislaine Jean-Baptiste. ``People who vote will have to overcome fear _ if they vote.'' Nine pipe bombs exploded in the capital Wednesday and Thursday, killing two children. Schools have stayed closed since then, shops remain shuttered and the usually bustling streets are quiet. Early Saturday, only the throbbing of voodoo drums in the hills above the capital broke the silence. Aristide blamed the bombings on opponents trying to ``block the elections.'' Opposition leaders claim they were orchestrated by the government of President Rene Preval, Aristide's hand-picked successor, to provide an excuse for low voter turnout.

Peru's new interim President Valentine Paniagua has named his new cabinet. The sixteen new ministers are mostly moderate figures who can expect backing across the political spectrum. Congress appointed Mr. Paniagua as interim President Wednesday after dismissing the previous leader Alberto Fujimori. The Paniagua presidency brings an end to 10 years of autocratic rule by ex-President Fujimori. As VOA's Bill Rogers reports, people hope Peru's new interim President can make democratic reforms and end years of corruption and abuse of power. Hours after Wednesday's inauguration, people were still gathered in front of the presidential palace, watching dignitaries going in and out of the building to pay their respects to Peru's new President. The crowds were small as darkness fell, but their presence was symbolic. For months, the area around the place had been the scene of protest as people marched to demand the resignation of Mr. Fujimori. Clashes occasionally broke out between riot police and protestors and blue clouds of choking teargas would fill the square in front of the building. But on Wednesday evening all was peaceful. A new climate could be felt according to onlooker Roy Pumahambo who described himself as an Indian from the Andean highlands. He said ex-President Fujimori left many negative things, shadows of ambition for power, shadows of desperation and all this has been swept away. Others view the change that had taken place in more practical terms. Van Oscar says he hopes the new interim government can begin to turn the country around economically. Yes, he said, there have to be economic changes, simply because there will be more openness. Too many things were hidden under the old government. Too much money was stolen. Mr. Oscar was referring to reports that billions of dollars earned from the sale of state companies during the Fujimori administration apparently cannot be fully accounted for. Mr. Fujimori, who is of Japanese descent, was a political unknown when he was elected President in 1990. His success in stabilizing the economy and putting down two violent leftist insurgencies gained him widespread support during his first five-year term. But Mr. Fujimori also had an authoritarian streak. He temporarily abolished the Congress in 1992 and the notorious Spy Chief Vladamiro Montecinos undermined Peru's political opposition. It was the broadcast of a video tape in mid September showing Mr. Montecinos apparently bribing a politician that triggered the political firestorm that eventually brought down Mr. Fujimori and lead to his letter of resignation sent earlier this week from Japan. In the wake of Mr. Fujimori's departure, President Valentine Paniagua's main task will be to organize new elections for next April, after which he will hand over power to his elected successor in July. Mr. Fujimori's re-election this past May to a third term in office was marred by irregularities and charges of vote fraud. In his inauguration speech Wednesday, Mr. Paniagua pledged to enact reforms that will make next year's elections free and fair. Bill Rogers, VOA News, Lima.

A fire in a garment factory left at least 45 people dead, most of them killed in the crush as panicked workers tried to flee the four-story building in an industrial town near the capital, police and doctors said Sunday. Most of the dead were women and children. More than 100 others were hospitalized with injuries after the fire and stampede Saturday night at Chowdhury Knitwear Garments factory in Shibpur, 25 miles east of Dhaka. Some of the injured were in critical condition, and the death toll could rise, a police official supervising the rescue work said. At least 900 workers, many of them women, were at the factory when a fire broke out on the its fourth floor, where towels and knitwear are ironed. Workers scrambled to flee the factory along narrow stairwells and many of them fell on each other, officials said. Nearly all the victims died in the stampede, and many of the injured had jumped out windows trying to escape, Sitish Ranjan, the area's chief government administrator, said in a telephone interview. He said a probe had been ordered. Witnesses told newspapers workers were trapped because the only exit door on the ground floor was locked for security reasons and had to be broken open by firefighters. The factory owner, Sagar Chowdhury, disputed those accounts. He said the fire was caused by a short circuit on the fourth floor. Bangladesh has nearly 2,000 garment factories that employ at least 1.5 million workers, most of them young women. Children also work in the factories. Garment exports, mainly to the United States and Europe, account for nearly 70 percent of Bangladesh's total annual export revenue of $5 billion.

Former President Ion Iliescu seemed headed for victory in the presidential election Sunday, but he will face a runoff in two weeks against a nationalist extremist who has soared in opinion polls in the last month. Iliescu, who was president from 1990 to 1996, had 37 percent of the vote in exit polls. But the far right Greater Romania Party, led by Corneliu Vadim Tudor, stunned analysts and the country by going from 3.6 percent of the vote in 1996 to 27 percent in exit polls this time. In recent months he dropped the anti-Hungarian and anti-Semitic oratory he was noted for, as well as the quest for the Greater Romania that his party champions, and concentrated on one message: if elected, he would ``liquidate the mafia'' that has sapped the wealth of this country, which he has said ``can only be governed with a machine gun.'' The centrist coalition that governed for the last four years essentially destroyed itself in the campaign just as it did in office: by constant bickering. Five centrist candidates ran, each getting between 2 and 13 percent. All vote-counting in Romania is by hand, and final results will not be in for two days, but exit polls in the last local vote were accurate. Iliescu and Tudor will face each other in a Dec. 10 runoff, and political analysts confidently predicted Sunday night that Iliescu would pick up almost all the centrist votes and win easily. ``If Romanians are obliged to choose between those two, they'll make Iliescu the great winner,'' predicted Ilie Serbanescu, an economist who was briefly Minister of Reform three years ago. Bogdan Chirieac, chief editorial writer for the Adevarul newspaper, called the 70-year-old Iliescu ``the Gorbachev of Romania'' and said ``it's ridiculous that he's going to be president again, but we are in the childhood of democracy.'' Serbanescu noted wryly that ``the disastrous failure of the last four years transformed Iliescu into the savior of the nation _ which forgot the failure of his first six years.'' Iliescu, a former communist party official who became president when he formed the National Salvation Front during the 1989 riots that overthrew the rule of Nicolae Ceausescu but who was unable to turn the economy around, said Sunday night that he won because people were ``disappointed in economic decline, poverty and unemployment.'' He blamed the centrist coalition for Tudor's strong showing, saying its failures ``revolted the people and opened them to this vigilante language.'' ``One cannot run a country with slogans,'' he added in a slap at Tudor. Tudor, by contrast, said that beating Iliescu in the runoff would be ``difficult but not impossible.'' ``I'm 20 years younger,'' he said. ``When he was in Moscow, I was being born. When he was studying communist history, I was studying in Vienna.'' Disclaiming his communist past is part of Tudor's new persona. He was once known as the ``court poet'' of the Ceausescus, who ruled the country for 30 years and boasted that they would bring Romania beyond mere socialism into ``perfect communism.'' Both candidates did well because Romanians are so desperate. The average wage is $100 a month and 40 percent of the population lives on $1 a day or less, while winter is coming. Tudor's gains in the polls all came in the last three weeks, catching the rest of the field napping. Iliescu barnstormed fading factory towns but relaxed at the end and even ignored one televised debate because of a feud with the TV network. Tudor did well on talk shows with his quick wit and talk of a ``Robin Hood approach'' to the economy _ robbing the rich to feed the poor. Tudor is a complicated figure _ he is considered both an extremist and a clown. After his Ceausescu patrons were executed, he recast himself as a virulent nationalist, promoting Christianity and the army and insisting that Romania should take back Moldavia and parts of the Ukraine while warning that Hungary sought Transylvania back. His new platform favors ``the dictatorship of law,'' including deporting people for ``anti-Romanian activities,'' a referendum on restoring the death penalty for pedophiles and child-murderers, and creating ``national construction sites'' for wayward youth. ``Gypsy criminality must be eradicated by education and jobs,'' his platform says. Economically, he wants to renationalize all commodities from iron mines to oil wells, subsidize agriculture and create 500,000 jobs by ``reopening profitable industries artificially closed down.'' He argues that many fading Romanian factories that had layoffs after privatization were actually closed to stifle competition _ a French cement company, for example, bought and closed several Romanian plants. Until recently, his two weekly magazines routinely attacked people with epithets like ``dirty Jew'' or ``Hungarian terrorist'' and he has published lists of ``traitors who should be liquidated.'' The vigorous and omnipresent American ambassador here, James Rosapepe, shuns him because of such statements and Chirieac said Tudor's second-place finish ``will put Romania in an awful position _ it might turn the West's face away from us.'' Valeria Dorneanu, a sociologist who writes political commentary, said Tudor ``is not a political person, but a character _ one that the voters turned into a political man.'' ``Unlike all the others, he had never governed,'' Tudor said, ``so the voters saw him as clean. He had only one message: `There will be justice.' And Romanians understood that if there was justice, they would also have food. And that was enough.''

The hardest fought contests the morning of Sunday's presidential election were on the barricaded streets of the capital and not inside the polls. Throughout many parts of the city, eager groups of youngsters played soccer while a mere trickle of voters went to the cast ballots in an election that many assumed would be won by Jean-Bertrand Aristide, who faced no serious challengers after the opposition announced a boycott. Aristide, a former Catholic priest, became this Caribbean nation's first democratically elected president in 1990. He was on the cusp of returning to power in an election that has brought an international quandary among those who have expressed grave reservations about the legitimacy of Sunday's vote and the fairness of last May's legislative election that gave Aristide's Lavalas Party a near-majority in the Parliament. After he was ousted in a military coup in 1991, Aristide returned victoriously from exile three years later behind a 20,000-strong American-led invasion force to serve out his truncated term. While the outside donor countries have grown frustrated and impatient with the political deadlock here between Lavalas and the opposition, Aristide's supporters have endowed him with an almost mythic, messianic resonance and have waited for this day to return him to the Presidential Palace. ``Everything is going to be all right,'' said Reginald Colon, a poll worker in the Saint Martin neighborhood, where polls at a local hospital were nearly deserted at midday. ``We are here to do one job for one person, Aristide. He is the hope after God. He is the one we believe in after God. He is the one who can do something.'' Aristide wordlessly cast his ballot Sunday afternoon at a school not too far from his walled residence in the suburb of Tabarre, while armed private guards and police patrolled on the roof. While electoral officials said voter turnout started slowly but increased by midday and domestic observer groups estimated that turnout could reach 60 percent, the same figure as in last May's legislative elections, polling places Sunday seemed empty in comparison. Almost no independent estimate of voter turnout was available, because none of the international and domestic observers from the previous election participated in this election because of serious reservations over the vote counting method used in the last vote. Radio reports estimated that turnout was below 10 percent, and visits to several polling places that last May had lines of people snaking outside indicated a similarly small turnout by late morning. The International Coalition of Electoral Observers, a group of 24 American observers from religious and solidarity groups, said they had seen at least 15 percent turnout in most neighborhoods and as many as 50 percent in the poor areas that are Aristide's strongholds. There were also radio reports of higher turnout in some cities outside of Port-au-Prince. Although two pipe bombs exploded early Sunday morning, the day was mostly calm and there were no reports of fatalities. Poll workers admitted in many places that turnout was lower than official estimates, but said they expected more people to come after church or later in the day. Other poll workers said that perhaps people were waiting to see if there was any violence, but outside the streets were filled with people shopping or children playing. Opposition leaders seized on the indications of low turnout to call for the resignation of the current president, Rene Preval, and his prime minister, Jacques-Edouard Alexi, and the appointment of a new Electoral Council. ``We are not going to recognize this election,'' said Evans Paul, a former supporter of Aristide, who now belongs to the Democratic Convergence, a coalition of opposition groups. ``We are going to assemble all of the sectors of society who argued with the elections. We are going to look for the support of the Haitian majority who abstained from the elections.'' In Cite Soleil, a slum whose residents have benefited from water, food and schools provided by Aristide in the past, there were more voters than at other places. Early in the day, men with megaphones took to the tightly packed neighborhoods and urged people to vote. ``I trust elections in Haiti, but I do not trust the elections in the United States,'' said Bob Moliere, who belongs to an organization that supports Aristide. ``They do not know how to have good elections in their own country. Haiti is professional in elections. We know how to do elections.'' Later in the day there were contrasting radio reports _ that, while turnout was low, poll workers had already run out of ballots. There were other reports that people were being allowed to vote in some places other than their normal precinct. The electoral council later extended the closing time one hour, to six o'clock. Those who did vote for Aristide said they were intent on seeing the country change for the better. They said that although Preval was Aristide's protege, he was unable to accomplish much because of a recalcitrant Parliament and an upper class that ignored or exploited the poor. Inside a polling place at an abandoned theater across the street from the Church of St. Jean Bosco, where Aristide used to deliver impassioned sermons when he was a priest, Enel Sabin said he hoped to find work. ``I want to be free, I want liberty,'' he said. ``I am not free yet. Nothing functions yet. I want change. Aristide is the one hope to take us out of this misery.'' Diplomats have criticized both Lavalas and the opposition for failing to reach a compromise that would have allowed the elections to go forward with more political parties participating. While Lavalas presented a platform for improving education, health care, food and employment, the opposition repeated their calls for a boycott and did not even bother to have a candidate waiting in the wings in case an accord had been brokered. Whether or not the other nations, which provide some 70 percent of the financial needs of Haiti, the poorest in the Hemisphere, will work with Aristide is unclear. The United States, which withheld any aid for the elections and did not send observers, had insisted that all sides in the Haitian crisis had to reach some sort of accord for the elections to be considered fair and open. Until then, officials said earlier this month, all assistance will be funneled through nongovernmental organizations. But diplomats who had spoken with Aristide said he was aware of the need to persuade other nations to work with him. They speculated that he might try to work out some agreement over the contested Senate seats from the May elections or appoint opposition figures to his government.

The Clinton administration is prepared to assist Peru's transitional government in such areas as counternarcotics enforcement and democratic reform before presidential elections set for next April, a senior State Department official said Monday. The official, asking not to be identified, spoke to reporters five days after the installation of interim president Valentin Paniagua, who replaced former President Alberto Fujimori. The administration had been highly critical of Fujimori's refusal to promote an independent judiciary and other features it called essential to a democratic society. The official said Paniagua's government must overhaul the electoral machinery with the purpose of achieving free, honest and fair elections. Fujimori had resisted efforts the Organization of American States initiated last June to promote democratic reforms. The official said initial U.S. soundings suggest that the Paniagua government will give high priority to the counternarcotics struggle. Fujimori, who resigned a week ago in Japan amid a corruption scandal, had been an ally of the United States in combating drug flow. Estimates say coca cultivation declined 60 percent over the past several years under his leadership. The administration had been concerned that Fujimori's departure would provoke civil unrest, but it is encouraged by what has transpired thus far. Peter Romero, who heads the State Department's Latin American affairs bureau and visited Lima a week ago as Fujimori was stepping down, said the U.S. government ``looks forward to supporting President Paniagua and his cabinet as they prepare for new elections and in the process consolidate democracy'' He said the cabinet Paniagua has assembled is ``talented and respected,'' noting that it is led by former U.N. Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar. ___ On the Net: State Department Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs: www.state.gov/www/regions/wha/index.html

After a decade in which he governed Peru as an authoritarian ruler, Alberto Fujimori now seems weary and regretful as he adjusts to a new life as a private citizen here. Slouched on a couch in his plush hotel suite during most of a 50-minute interview, his posture suggested both physical and moral fatigue. Still, Fujimori, who switched freely back and forth between English and Spanish, expressed no regrets about his most fateful decisions in a life of politics that apparently ended last week when he resigned the Peruvian presidency during a visit here in Tokyo, after attending a summit meeting of Pacific rim nations in Brunei. He stood by his decision to change Peru's electoral rules so that he could run for a third term, and by his failure to move against his intelligence chief, Vlademiro Montesinos, even after that man's indiscretions began posing a threat to his political survival. ``The decision might have been better to close my presidency after two terms, but there was a risk, and the risk was that there was no strong candidate from my party,'' he said. ``It was decided that I should contest the elections again. That is too bad, but it happened that way. I had no successor.'' The former president minced few words about Montesinos, who was captured on videotape seeming to pay a bribe to a legislator, in an incident that precipitated Fujimori's downfall, accusing him of making off with $48 million in illegally obtained money. Montesinos, who returned to Peru after a brief exile, subsequently eluded Fujimori's attempts to have him arrested. Fujimori said his intelligence chief, ``still enjoys the protection of powerful groups in the society, and he is not alone. He has ties to members of Congress, including to the opposition. He has the support of at least two television networks, and he has the support of several judges. So much so that the people who were investigating him are now being persecuted.'' Fujimori defended his decision not to arrest Montesinos immediately after the bribery scandal, offering him a chance for asylum in Panama instead _ saying that it had been taken in the interest of political peace in the runup to elections. ``Everybody supported the asylum,'' he said. ``Even the United States.'' Fujimori staked a bold claim for continued popular support in his country, and expressed strong remorse for causing confusion among his supporters. ``The opposition will not forgive me, in part, because of my mistakes, but mostly because of my success,'' he said. ``Even now I have the support of a lot of people. One quarter of the population still supports me, even with all of these problems, and despite my resignation, which is unexplained.'' But ever decisive, Fujimori stated categorically that he had no interest in becoming president yet again, calling statements to the opposite effect quoted in some media ``a joke.'' ``I have the complete conviction that I will never again be president,'' Fujimori said. ``The question I was asked was whether I could overcome all of these problems and become president again. Why not? But I don't want to be president.'' About his future, though, Fujimori's plans remained vague. ``I have not fixed the period of my stay in Japan,'' he said. ``That depends on the evolution of the situation in Peru. Some people may feel that my return might disturb the political process.'' In the meantime, with the support of friends this man whose parents emigrated from Japan to Peru before his birth, and who says he did not learn Spanish until the age of 5, plans to settle down and relearn a language he says is still engraved in his mind from childhood. He plans to write a book about his experiences, including his 1996 decision to raid the Japanese Embassy in Peru and free hostages being held by leftist guerrillas. ``I will write about the Japan Embassy incident, about peace with Ecuador, about the fight against terrorism, even about El Nino,'' he said. ``If I can earn $1 per book, the Japanese will buy 500,000 copies, and I will have half a million dollars. Why not sell it in America, too? ``I will become a Japanese taxpayer.'' Fujimori dismissed the accusations of corruption made against him in recent days as groundless, and denied that he holds any bank accounts outside of Peru, as critics have alleged. Fujimori used the word surprise together with another, confusion, to describe the impact of his abrupt resignation on his nation, and on his supporters after a career marked by never-say-quit doggedness. ``I took a surprise decision to move on the Japanese Embassy at a time when all of the journalists were sleeping or taking a snack,'' he said. ``In the crisis with Ecuador, I took the decisions by myself to reach a peace, despite the warnings of my advisers. ``This kind of way of making politics in Peru took everybody by surprise,'' Fujimori added. ``But I am a decision-maker. This time I had to make a decision, too. A surprising decision in this unusual decision to resign, and it has been very difficult to explain to the Peruvian people. My decisions are sometimes regarded as a betrayal, but some months later, people say, oh, Fujimori was right.''

Corneliu Vadim Tudor's spin doctor has his work cut out. ``Handling Vadim's image,'' said Radu Toma, Tudor's aide, ``is mostly telling him to calm down, calm down. I tell him not to be just in the eye of the hurricane, but also not to be the hurricane itself. Just to put his hand into it once in a while.'' Toma tried to rein in the whirlwind during an election-night interview in Tudor's office as 30 supporters lined the walls, murmuring assent or calling out words or figures the chief was searching for. ``What the president means when he says the law must be enforced with a machine gun,'' Toma said at one point, miming a soldier with a slung weapon, ``is not that he will shoot people, but that the machine gun is on the shoulder.'' Tudor, president of the Greater Romania Party, apparently took second place in Romania's presidential election on Sunday, stunning even himself. ``It's a miracle! A miracle! I believe in God _ like you, sir,'' he assured a reporter whose religious inclinations he knew nothing about. (He added that he found America's elections alarming and that he favors George W. Bush, who ``is spiritual like me, a Christian'' rather than Al Gore, who spent eight years associated with Bill Clinton, who refused to halt the bombing of Yugoslavia during Easter of 1999.) Toma's work is cut out mostly because the first words out of many Romanians' mouths when Tudor's name is raised are: ``Vadim? He's crazy.'' Crazy or calm, he got the votes of many Romanians on Sunday. Though official results are not out yet, exit polls gave him 27 percent of the vote, far ahead of the pack of centrist technocrats whose fractious coalition ran the country for the last four years. And the polls put him a mere 10 points behind former President Ion Iliescu, who is famous for calming the 1989 street-fighting that ended the Ceausescu dictatorship and running the country until 1996. Polls said that Tudor did particularly well among the young, the poor and the less-educated. ``I voted for Vadim,'' nodded Mircea Serban, 20, who shines shoes in the lobby of the Hilton Hotel here. ``The machine gun is right for them,'' he explained, affirming that he agrees with Tudor's contention that ``Romanian Mafia, Russian Mafia, Turkish Mafia, Greek Mafia'' have all submerged this impoverished country in a cesspool of corruption. Many young Romanians know nothing of Tudor's past as the ``court poet'' in the Ceausescu regime and are not concerned about his desire to recover bits of Romania lost since 1918. They have not read his magazines, which refer to ``dirty Jews,'' ``fascist Hungarians'' and ``criminal Gypsies'' and have published lists of his political enemies and their addresses just as vengeful miners he has stirred up are marching on Bucharest. Rather, they have seen him on television in the last few weeks, when he stuck to his ``liquidate the Mafia'' message and promised 500,000 jobs by reviving Romanian factories whose products he says the Third World is still clamoring for _ tractors, weapons, medicines and drilling tools. Tudor speaks rivetingly, with many joking asides, spinning parables out of his wide knowledge of world history. He loves America right up from its roots, for example, preferring the Pilgrim vision to Walter Raleigh's commercial one. Bogdan Chirieac, chief editorial writer for the newspaper Adevarul, calls Tudor a ``deep extremist'' who has remade himself to get votes and points out that Hitler came to power when Germany was as desperate as Romania is because of its lagging economy. But he feels the comparisons to Hitler end there. ``He's a big mouth, but quite a cowardly person,'' Chirieac said. ``I strongly don't believe he would provoke international conflict.'' (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) In fact, Tudor is more reminiscent of Vladimir Zhirinovsky, the showy and once-influential Russian nationalist, but cuts a somewhat sillier figure. Tudor went out to vote in a thick fog wearing bug-eyed movie star sunglasses and hands out books of his romantic poetry, which in translation is a bit maudlin but full of original images. He practically begs a questioner to ``punish your informers'' who have called him an anti-Semite. ``What must I do to explain that I am a friend of the Jewish people?'' he asks, citing Jacob's struggle with an angel and declaiming, ``I carry a Bible!'' while waving a copy of the New Testament. (END OPTIONAL TRIM) When asked about his magazines' references to Jews, Tudor rapidly says that they were mistranslations, that they were ``jokes,'' that others wrote them, that he writes in a ``pamphleteer'' style, that one Jew who complained is a former Soviet agent who wrote ``four books of lies about the United States'' and that he hates no one because he pays out of his own salary for ``Christian supper for 130 families'' of all ethnic backgrounds. Toma, who lived in New York for 20 years, explained more calmly that Tudor was born in 1949, the son of a poor Baptist tailor and a Romanian Orthodox mother, in a section of Bucharest ``someplace like north of 96th Street, where there were Romanians, Jews, Gypsies all together, so there was no reason to hate anybody.'' But Tudor's generation was taught by its parents that communism arrived on Soviet tanks in 1944, and, Toma said, ``used the quislings at hand and brought in others, mainly Jewish.'' The feeling that Jews had sold the country to the Soviets pervades Tudor's generation, he said. (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) Tudor got a personal reputation as an anti-Semite because of a 1984 dispute with Romania's chief rabbi over the publication of the complete writings of the poet Mihai Eminescu. They included unflattering references to merchants, which the rabbi wanted expunged. Tudor ``took a violent tone against this'' in his magazines, Toma admitted. (END OPTIONAL TRIM) In any case, during the election night interview, Tudor offered to give up his magazines ``if God will help me become president'' in the Dec. 10 runoff. But people like Romeo Mocanu, a Bucharest cab driver who plans to do what political analysts have predicted, may have more impact on the outcome. ``I don't like Iliescu, but in two weeks, I will go put my vote for him,'' he promised. ``Because Vadim is crazy. If you have two bad things, you choose.''

The lawyer representing a US businessman accused of spying against Russia says new court evidence could exonerate his client. Larry James reports from Moscow on the latest developments in the trial of Edmund Pope. Defense lawyer Pable Ustakov told VOA, the court has accepted into evidence a document from a Moscow University, proving what his client has said all along that the information he obtained was not secret and that he had permission to send it abroad. Mr. Pope is accused of obtaining top-secret information in a report on a Russian torpedo, written by a Professor at Moscow's Bowman Technical Institute. The lawyer says the document accepted by the court is a letter from the University which gave Mr. Pope permission to do just that. Mr. Ustokov cautioned, however, that this does not mean his client's problems are over. He said that at this stage the new evidence will have to be considered along with earlier testimony from Russian military experts who testified that the information Mr. Pope was trying to obtain was in fact secret. Even so, Mr. Ustokov says, the document accepted into evidence on Monday is strong proof of his client's innocence. Larry James, VOA News, Moscow.

Former UN Secretary General Haviar Perez Dequia has been sworn in as the new Prime Minister of Peru. He was appointed by the interim President Valentine Paniagua, who will lead the country to new elections scheduled for April. Meanwhile former President Alberto Fujimori, who was ousted by Congress for moral unfitness, has not ruled out returning to Peru to continue a career in politics. Claire Marshall reports from the Peruvian capital, Lima. Eighty-year-old Habiar Perez Dequia has formally assumed the role of Prime Minister of Peru in a ceremony in central Lima. The former Secretary General of the United Nations, who ran against Mr. Fujimori for the presidency in 1995, will also hold the position of Foreign Minister. Mr. Perez Dequia was selected by caretaker President Valentine Paniagua to help prepare Peru for free and fair elections in eight months time. In his acceptance speech, he said that the priority of the new cabinet is to ensure that this process is impartial and transparent. Meanwhile ex-leader Fujimori told reporters in Tokyo, he is still considering whether to return to Peru and run for Congress in the April elections. He is continuing to deny allegations of corruption, saying that his former chief advisor Vladimero Montecinos is to blame for the slurs against his name. This is Claire Marshall for VOA News, Lima.

For a glimpse of the shadowy world of fugitive ex-spy chief Vladimiro Montesinos, Peruvians were taken through a secret tunnel leading to an escape hatch under his bathtub. From there, Peru's Panamericana Television broadcast an exclusive tour Sunday night of the spymaster's luxury beach house in Lurin, a Pacific coast resort town 22 miles south of Lima. The house _ hidden behind high windowless walls topped with protective electrified wires _ was raided earlier this month by police searching for the elusive intelligence adviser. It was Montesinos' reputed web of corruption that led to President Alberto Fujimori's downfall after a decade of authoritarian rule. The dusty treeless streets outside the home belied an opulent setting, replete with wood panel doors reinforced with armor plating, a portable satellite phone in the master bedroom, and hidden cameras in the guest suites and inside a stereo speaker by the indoor pool. Before going into hiding, Montesinos reportedly made copies of some 2,500 video and audio recordings that presumably incriminate politicians, military leaders and businessmen. Since his return last month from a failed asylum bid in Panama, he has remained Peru's most wanted man. He faces criminal complaints ranging from directing death squads and torture to laundering money from narcotics trafficking. Rumors abound that he has already left Peru and is in hiding in Bolivia or Paraguay. But Francisco Loayza, a former intelligence agent who has written a book about Montesinos called ``The Dark Face of Power,'' said Monday he believes the ex-spy chief is still in Peru. ``With complete certainty, the best place to hide for Montesinos right now is Peru. Why? Because of the abounding information he has on a lot of people,'' Loayza said. ``I believe he has a high percentage of documents that serve as instruments of coercion and blackmail and therefore he is probably in the process of moving from house to house.'' Montesinos was once Fujimori's closest adviser and viewed by many Peruvians as even more powerful than the former president. Montesinos was forced underground after the broadcast in September of a videotape snatched from his collection showing him in the apparent act of bribing a congressman. Allegations followed that he had laundered more than $48 million in Swiss bank accounts, and at least $10 million more in banks in New York, Uruguay, Luxembourg, and the Cayman Islands. Montesinos' official salary was about $370 per month, about three times the monthly minimum wage of $117 _ a benchmark that half the population living in poverty fails to earn. The broadcast images gave a hint of how Montesinos spent at least some of his fortune to ensure that an escape route would always be available. He installed a pink bathtub that when lifted revealed a tunnel leading under the house to a secret hatch under a plant bed on a nearby street. Another secret panel by the pool led to a garage in a neighboring house. Fujimori fired Montesinos in September and said he would step down next year after new elections. But Congress ousted Fujimori from office last week, declaring him morally unfit for the presidency and ignoring his resignation offered from self-imposed exile in Japan. The scandal involving Montesinos has spread to Switzerland, and Swiss authorities said Tuesday that $48 million in Swiss bank accounts that they say is linked to the spymaster likely came from payments of commissions on arms deals between Peru and Russia. The accounts are frozen. In a statement from the Zurich district attorney's office, officials also said they had found _ and frozen _ another $22 million from the arms deals. They did not explicitly link the funds to Montesinos, but to the deals. Meanwhile, Japanese officials said Tuesday that the government has not yet determined whether Fujimori holds citizenship from Japan, from where his parents emigrated. They added that he would be permitted to stay in Japan for the time being.

Mexicans elected their leader five months ago but Vicente Fox is still President-elect in Mexico. When he and his National Action party take the reigns on Friday, it will be the first hand over of power to an opposition party in Mexico's history. Yesterday Fox named the final members of his cabinet, promising they will restore order and respect to Mexico. Many Mexicans hoped that's true and that their new leaders will crack down on the country's rampant crime and corruption. The World's Frank Contraris explains. Mexicans don't trust their police. This month an incident that might have angered Americans hardly raised an eyebrow in the northwestern state of Sineloa, the heroin capital of Mexico. Late one night in Sineloa's crime ridden capital, Colia Kun some police officers pulled over a pick up truck. They suspected the driver of drug trafficking, but the officers seemed nervous when I showed up on the scene with a microphone. One mumbled an explanation of their intentions and as a group of onlookers assembled, another took me aside and defended the police action. Officer Ismail Kastenitus said he suspected the driver of attempting to purchase an illegal firearm and using illegal drugs but the bystanders all assumed that the police were about to take a bribe and didn't only because of the witnesses. Whatever the case, the incident only reinforced the cynicism these Mexicans feel about law enforcement and that suggests why Vicente Fox's final group of cabinet appointments was all the more crucial. Last night Fox promised that he and his cabinet will work to build new strong institutions to replace the old corrupt ones. We aim to construct transparent institutions with an attitude of service, integration that will help us achieve an authentic democracy in our country. A true state of law, respect for the law, tranquility and peace in each home and family, in each state and municipality. Our government's challenge is to be absolutely committed to making Mexico's laws valid guidelines for achieving peace and justice. Fox named Mexico City's Police Chief Alhandro Gertz to a new cabinet post for law enforcement. The position was created to respond to cries from citizens who are fed up with rising crime in Mexico. An army prosecutor will take over as Attorney General and a former Governor Francisco Bario will be Comptroller General, incharge of preventing fiscal crimes in government. Bario admits that drug traffickers have had a tremendous corrupting influence on government officials. Mexico's former anti-drugs staff for instance is in jail for taking millions of dollars in bribes from narco traffickers and hundreds of police have been fired in recent years for aiding crime syndicates. In parts of Baja, California the powerful Ariano Felix drug cartel called the shots, according to social scientist, Victor Kark Alfaro. The Ariano brothers consolidated their power in Baja, California in the 1990s while Vicente Fox's National Action party held the Governor's seat. A visit to the Omia cemetery in Kudeakan Sinaloa during the day of the dead ceremonies demonstrates the human costs of soaring drug-related crimes. The elaborate gravesites were paid for by the rich families of Sinalovis drug kingpins says crime writer Leonardos Alfa. Alfaro says the dead who filled this corner of the cemetery were mostly murder victims, who lost their lives in the past two years in drug related gunfights. If President-elect Vicente Fox and his tough on crime cabinet have their way, business at the Omia cemetery won't be booming much longer. For The World, this is Frank Contraris.

The Dutch Parliament has approved a draft law to legalize euthanasia. The new law will give doctors immunity from prosecution if they perform mercy killings according to strict medical guidelines. Geraldine Coclyn reports. Although no Dutch court has ever sentenced a doctor for carrying out euthanasia, doctors are required to report all cases to the public prosecutor and in some instances they have been brought to court. As a result only half of euthanasia cases are reported. The Health Minister Els Borst said, she is satisfied that people now have a choice in their own destiny.

The Dutch Parliament today voted to legalize euthanasia. That will make the Netherlands the first country in the world to formally endorse what some call 'mercy killing'. Supporters hail the move as a victory for patient's rights. Opponents fear the law will be abused. The World's Jennifer Glass has our story. The day Nalika Dumay's mother died was bittersweet. She had suffered from cancer and chose medically assisted suicide rather than weeks or months of pain. She wanted her family around her. Nallika is glad she was there. My mother was crazy about red roses, so I buy twenty red roses for her and I take candles and the doctor came. I was sitting beside one side and hold her in my arms and then she asked me, now I want to pray and then she prayed, and then she said, well now I am ready for the journey. This is better than laying for days and days with screaming and lot of pain. Since the 1970s, the Netherlands has progressively passed laws making assisted suicide easier. Last year Dutch doctors officially helped more than 2200 people to die, although the actual number is believed to be much higher. Many assisted deaths went unreported because until this latest legislation doctors could be prosecuted. The penalty was upto 12 years in jail. Rob Yanquire of the Dutch Voluntary Euthanasia Society says the new legislation removes that punishment. In this way a doctor, who according to a very serious request from a patient considers to comply to request and do euthanasia, he is no longer punishable or doing any criminal act. And although he has not been prosecuted the last 20 years regularly, but still he has been doing a crime. And that's better with this law, he is not doing a crime as long as he is following the rules. Dutch professor Haglinen who drafted the legislation says it includes strict guidelines based on solid medical ethics. There must be unbearable suffering, there must be another doctor who judges also about the patient and there has to been no alternative, said rules in the law. They have to be followed. The legislation has its opponents. Almost immediately after its passage today, the Vatican condemned the legislation calling it a law that goes against human dignity. Moll Creeper of the Dutch anti-euthanasia organization, Care for Life, says it sends a bad message. When I listen to these debates, I become a little bit sad because there are great things that they are discussing together about life and deaths. And while we are taking out a direction that's not good for our country and also it's not a good signal for the world we live in. Doctor Wida Plompen Harmolen runs two hospices in the Netherlands, where terminally ill patients can spend their final days supported by volunteers. In an attempt to offer an alternative to euthanasia then Harmolen says hospice care eases the reasons people give for wanting to commit suicide: pain, loneliness and being a burden on others. We are treating the pain. People are no longer lonely. They are no longer a burden because we like to take care of them and say, it's a joy for us to take care of them. The only other place in the world where doctor-assisted suicide is legal for terminally ill patients is in Oregon. Well, law took affect in 1997. Since then 43 people have died in medically assisted suicide. Last year, though, Dr. Jack Kevorkian and the famed euthanasia proponent was sentenced to 10 to 25 years for second degree murder. He was convicted in the 1998 death of a terminally ill man in Michigan whose death Kevorkian had videotaped. In October 1999, the US Congress voted in favor of making the use of controlled substances for physician-assisted suicide a Federal crime. A debate and vote on the legislation is pending in the US Senate. For The World, I am Jennifer Glass. Many of the Dutch people who opt for physician-assisted suicide suffered from AIDS. In fact, one third of patients dying with AIDS in the Netherlands already received euthanasia. The afflictions devastating impact is worldwide and according to a UN report released today, growing. The study says that 21 million people have died from AIDS so far and that the death toll in the year 2000 is expected to be the highest ever. The research then covered an explosion of cases in Russia with this year's HIV infections on track to exceed the total in all previous years combined. The World's Nenad Sebek reports from Moscow.

The Dutch parliament voted Tuesday to allow doctors to provide lethal drugs to seriously ill patients who have requested to die. The bill, which is expected to become law next year, would make the Netherlands the first country to legalize mercy-killing and doctor-assisted suicide, practices that are now not legal but generally tolerated there. The legislation was approved by a 104-40 vote in the lower house of Parliament. Endorsement by the Senate is virtually assured. The Dutch action was immediately criticized by the Vatican. ``It is a very sad record for the Netherlands to become first to want to approve a law that goes against human dignity,'' said the Vatican spokesman, Joaquin Navarro-Valls, adding that the law would pose a ``very serious question of conscience which doctors will have to face.'' But years of intense debate and opinion polls have shown wide support among the Dutch public and the medical profession for the bill, which aims to clarify and define a practice that has become accepted in a country where doctors have helped thousands of terminally ill people die over the past decade. ``Doctors and healers everywhere have helped people put an end to their suffering and helped them die as long as they exist,'' said Rob Jonquiere, the director the Netherlands Association for Voluntary Euthanasia, an advocacy group with more than 100,000 members. ``This will end a gray area. We don't want something that happens anyway to go on underground.'' The new legislation, which was introduced by the Dutch ministers of justice and of health, applies only to physicians and not to others who might help a person die or commit suicide. It incorporates recent guidelines by the Royal Dutch Medical Association. Those stipulate that a patient's request to die must be voluntary, persistent and made while the person is lucid. The physician must be convinced that the patient is facing interminable and unbearable suffering, although the doctor may not suggest death as an option. In all cases, physicians must seek a second medical opinion before helping a patient die, and they must report the cause of death as euthanasia or suicide. Physicians will remain accountable for their actions. What is new, as euthanasia is decriminalized, is that physicians will no longer be accountable to a prosecutor but to a panel of peers, including legal, medical and ethical experts. Under the new legislation, no one has an automatic right to euthanasia _ every doctor has a right to refuse to cooperate when a patient demands assistance to die. One clause in an earlier draft of the legislation which would have permitted terminally ill children 12 or older to choose to die was dropped after it caused a public outcry. As approved Tuesday, the law would require young people from 12 up to 16 to have parental consent. From age 16, they may put the question to their doctor without parental approval. The Dutch decision is likely to draw particular scrutiny in other countries that are wrestling with the questions of doctor-assisted suicide and euthanasia. In Belgium, France and Switzerland, the issue has been under intense debate among legislators and in the news media. In 1996, Australia's Northern Territory first approved and then revoked a law allowing medically assisted suicide. In the United States, Oregon permits doctors in certain cases to help patients end their own lives. In the Netherlands, there have been calls for regulating euthanasia over the past three decades. Demands increased in 1973, when a doctor brought on the death of her aged, dying mother, and she was punished, albeit symbolically, with a one-year suspended sentence. Since then, few doctors have been been prosecuted, but studies suggest that only half or less than half of the cases of euthanasia or assisted suicide are reported, implying that doctors misrepresent the actual cause of death. Last year, unofficial figures indicated that 2,216 patients were assisted by doctors directly or indirectly in speeding up their death, but the number is believed to be closer to 5,000. Almost nine out of ten of the known cases involved people in the terminal stage of cancer. At the same time, doctors continue to refuse many requests, either be- cause they are opposed in principle or because they feel the request is not justified. According to national surveys, about two of three people who ask doctors to bring on their deaths are refused. Although the Netherlands is un- usually open to social experiments, the complex moral, ethical and legal issues involved in ending a life keep resurfacing. Polls show that 10 per- cent of the population, and 10 percent of physicians, are adamantly op- posed to the law. Even those who support the princi- ple of euthanasia or assisted suicide are deeply divided, with some argu- ing that the law is too restrictive and should allow terminally ill patients to receive life-ending drugs without a doctor's approval. The new bill did not clearly ad- dress the question of patients with dementia or Alzheimer's disease. The current practice is that doctors seek written confirmation of a pa- tient's wish to die. But the question remains what to do when a patient who has written the request while sound of mind is later found to be suffering from dementia. The Health Ministry said dementia itself can never be a valid reason for ending a person's life. The patient would have to be suffering from in- tolerable physical pain, it said, and the dementia could only be at a very early stage for a patient's request for euthanasia or assisted suicide to be accepted.

This is The World, a co-production of the BBC World Service PRI and WGBH in Boston. I am Lisa Mullins. Election workers in two Florida counties are packing up 14,000 disputed presidential ballots today to ship them off to Tallahassee. Circuit Judge Sander Sauls ordered the transfer of ballots to the state capital by Saturday. That is when he scheduled a hearing to determine whether they must be recounted. That ruling could help determine whether George W. Bush or Al Gore becomes the next President of the United States. Overseas Presidents and Prime Ministers, monarchs and dictators, are watching the ongoing presidential election and the Boston Globe's Kevin Collin in London is watching them. Kevin Collin, are Europeans worried about what is going on here? I mean, do they see the United States now as being detached and distracted and looking anywhere but at them? Yeah, I think there is a concern. I mean initially I think most of it was expressed as kind of jokes that the world's greatest democracy couldn't, you know, finish a democratic election. Now all the laughing, the chuckling, the chortling over the American indecision, all the talk about Chads in Florida, that has given way. You don't see people talking about that any more. It's a little more introspective, its a little more serious about, hey, this needs to get sorted out because we have some things that we want the Americans to deal with. And specifically what are they looking at? What are they doing about it? I mean, are they just sitting and watching and waiting? Are they taking action and preparing for either a Bush or a Gore presidency? No, I think there is just a question of wait and see. But I must say this week, talking to people in different parts of Europe there was a sense that it is going to be Bush and that people are preparing at that level. In the front head Mr. Bush has made it clear through Condoleezza Rice, who will probably be his National Security Advisor that he does not think Europe needs the American attention that it has received since the end of the second World War and that there is a possible disengagement, particularly in the Balkans and that concerns European government. But I must say, I've sensed frustration, they want to know whether the Balkans is going to be a place where you might see potential American pull out over the next couple of years. They want to know if the situation with national missile defense is going to be something they have to worry about because to a man and to a woman the European leaders think that that is a mistake, and that that's going to restart the arms race with the Russians. It is basically a return to the old cold war politics that everybody thought was over. So there is a great frustration, everybody is just sitting and waiting before they can move forward. What about other issues? I mean, how is the indecision here affecting issues such as The Hague environmental summit that happened last week, where the United States had very few friends in its stand on global warming? Would knowing who the next President is going to be have led to a different outcome at that conference? You could make that argument. In fact the British government particularly tried to broker a compromise between the rest of Europe and the Americans. Basically, the Britain has accepted the whole idea of growing forests as sinks for greenhouse gases that the Americans were trying to push as a compromise. The British, and particularly the Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott, had tried to convince the rest of the European allies that, "Hey, this might be the best deal we are going to get," because if in fact the new administration comes in and that administration is led by Mr. Bush, who is on record saying he doesn't even believe that global warming exists, that they are not going to get a deal. And so clearly there could have been a very different outcome if in fact Mr. Bush had been declared the winner by then because I think Mr. Prescott's argument would have been strengthened. That's it, the French in particularly who were leading the European Union delegation at The Hague, were adamant that there would be no compromise with the Americans on that. So, yeah I guess you could make the argument both ways, but because we didn't have a winner we will never really know. Kevin, take us to the Middle East. You have been talking to your correspondents there as well as the lack of US focus affecting things such as the Middle East crisis. Would there be a difference again if we knew who the President was going to be? Oh, yeah. I mean, obviously President Clinton did everything he could to try to broker an agreement here. And I mean, he did sort of get an agreement and a day later it was gone, and the realities of the street took over and left the situation there right now. But until there is a real winner, it seems obvious that both the Israelis and Palestinians they are not listening to Mr. Clinton because he is a lame duck. And yet who can they turn to because at this point they don't know whether it is going to be a continuation of the Clinton hand-holding presidency in trying to broker an agreement through sheer personality or there could be a concrete difference between what Mr. Gore or Mr. Bush thinks would work in the Middle East. Everybody is dealing with possibilities and theory and not with what is really going to happen. Whether it is the Middle East, whether it is Europe, whether it is Russia, no body can really deal with reality until they know who will be sitting in the White House at the end of January. The Boston Globe's Kevin Collin speaking to us from London. Thank you very much, Kevin. Thank you, Lisa.

Russia and the United States are pushing for an arms embargo against Afghanistan's Taliban militia. The associated press quotes the Dutch ambassador to the United Nations as saying a resolution on the matter may be introduced at the UN Security Council today. The resolution would pressure Taliban leaders to close terrorist-training camps, stop the flow of drugs, and hand over suspected terrorist leader Osama Bin Laden.

The results are in and former Haitian President Jean-Bertrand Aristide has been re-elected. Election officials say Mr. Aristide got 92% of the vote in Sunday's election. The main opposition parties boycotted the vote, alleging electoral fraud. Mr. Aristide was Haiti's first freely elected President in 1991. He was later ousted by a military coup, then restored to power in 1994 by a US led military invasion.

Russia and the United States are pushing for an arms embargo against Afghanistan's Taliban militia to pressure its leaders to close terrorist training camps, stop the flow of drugs and hand over suspected terrorist Osama bin Laden. U.S. officials acknowledged Wednesday that an embargo will be tough to enforce because of Afghanistan's porous borders, but they stressed that stopping even some weapons from getting to the Taliban will help the Afghan people. A year ago, the Security Council froze Taliban assets and imposed an air embargo on the Taliban-run airline to force the militia to deliver bin Laden for trial in the August 1998 bombings of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. The Taliban have refused, saying he is a guest and that the United States has not given proof of his involvement in terrorism. In April, the council threatened further sanctions to compel the Taliban to end years of fighting and comply with U.N. demands. With the situation little-changed, Russia is now sponsoring a Security Council resolution calling for new sanctions, strongly backed by the United States, which is a co-sponsor. While the United States and Russia remain at odds on many issues before the United Nations _ including Iraq and Kosovo _ they are united in their opposition to the Taliban, which has imposed a strict form of Islam in the territory it controls, barring women from work and girls from school. The Taliban, who rule about 95 percent of Afghanistan, including the capital Kabul, accuse Russia of arming and supporting opposition forces, led by ousted president Burhanuddin Rabbani and former defense minister Ahmed Shah Massood. The opposition says Pakistan backs the Taliban. Both Pakistan and Russia deny supplying arms to either side. The draft resolution would impose an arms embargo only on the Taliban, a U.S. official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. The proposed resolution also would freeze the assets of bin Laden and his organization, direct the Taliban to close camps where terrorists are trained and restrict travel of senior Taliban officials except for humanitarian and religious purposes. In addition, it would encourage other countries to reduce staff at Taliban missions, restrict offices of the Taliban-run airline outside Afghanistan and ban the sale to anyone in Afghanistan of acetic anhydride, a chemical precursor used to manufacture heroin, the U.S. official said. The Netherlands' U.N. Ambassador Peter van Walsum, the current council president, said the resolution may be introduced Thursday. France's U.N. Ambassador Jean-David Levitte said his country is concerned about the impact of new sanctions on international aid workers in Afghanistan _ half from France _ and is pressing for a one-year time limit for any new measures, which he believes the United States will support. A U.N. report released in August said the limited sanctions imposed last year _ when the country's 16 million people were already reeling from the worst drought in 30 years _ were hurting the poorest.

The United Nations climate talks ended last week in The Hague without an agreement on the implementation of rules to cut worldwide emissions on carbon dioxide, the greenhouse gas believed to cause global warming. But as VOA's Rosanne Scurbel reports, US environmental leaders say despite the setback, there has been a shift in the United States toward greater commitment to a climate change treaty. The UN climate meeting ended with suspension of talks, which left the door open to resume negotiations before the next round of talks in May. The major stumbling block in The Hague was a dispute between the European Union and the United States over carbon emissions reductions credits. But environmental leaders meeting in Washington this week say this dispute was nearly resolved when negotiators simply ran out of time. Jennifer Morgan with the Climate Change Campaign of the World Wildlife Fund, called for discussions to resume quickly, even before the next American President takes office in January. We all believe that the negotiations need to reconvene in weeks, not months, and you know, it's clear this matter is absolutely urgent and that the momentum is still there to move forward. Angela Antonelle is Director of Economic Policy at the Heritage Foundation. She says The Hague meeting was a failure. To say it suggests that there's simply not enough time, is ludicrous because the reality is they basically spent two weeks at The Hague trying to negotiate one aspect of the emissions trading system and there are so many other outstanding issues related to the implementation of the protocol. Angela Antonelle says the Kyoto Protocol is flawed because it excludes participation from developing countries. And over the next 20 years, it is going to be the developing nations like China and India that are going to be the largest emitter of greenhouse gases. So we are talking about trying to work out the details of a protocol to address global warming, which fundamentally misses the mark. The meeting in The Hague failed to implement the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, which calls on industrialized nations to reduce carbon emissions by 5% below 1990 levels by 2012. Despite the failure, environmental leaders believe important shifts are underway that show greater support in the United States for resolving global climate issues. Alden Mayer is with the Union of Concerned Scientists. He says the US Senate, which must ratify the treaty, is beginning to show signs it is ready for a change in US policy. Unfortunately, it seems the US negotiating strategy is still aimed at placating the Senate of three years ago when the Byrd-Hagal resolution was passed, rather than the likely much more receptive Senate of three years from now, when most of us believe the protocol might be brought forward for a vote. Three years ago, the US Senate voted unanimously not to ratify a treaty that could potentially hurt the nation's economy. Alden Mayer says that attitude is changing. The combination of the shift in composition of the Senate, new interest in the agricultural community, and the opportunities to be part of the solution, the presence in The Hague of the US labor delegation taking a much more progressive stance on domestic action in the United mine workers and the changes in the business community are significant. Phillip Klap with the National Environmental Trust says one business group that has changed its stance is the US utility industry, long opposed to Kyoto implementation. AP, the largest electric utility in the nation, reversed its stance on the treaty when the company realized it could make huge profits by earning carbon credits through the sale of its modern coal fire power plants that produce much fewer green house gases than the conventional version. Environmentalists are encouraged by this position and say they will continue to push domestically and internationally for an agreement that slows the rate of climate change. I'm Rosanne Scurbel.

Mexico's first opposition government in modern history took office Friday, marking the end of 71 years of single-party rule in Mexico. Interior Secretary Santiago Creel, President-elect Vicente Fox's soft-spoken lead negotiator, held a midnight ceremony to usher in the start of the historic administration that has promised to revamp the country by combatting everything from corruption to poverty. Defense Secretary Gen. Ricardo Vega and the attorney general, military Gen. Rafael Macedo, also took office at midnight. Fox, a brash cowboy and former Coca-Cola executive, was to be sworn in at noon Friday at a ceremony attended by 8,000 heads of state, officials and other dignitaries from around the world. Most Mexicans took Friday off to celebrate. Creel and Macedo in many ways represent the changing face of Mexico. As a top military prosecutor, Macedo took a tough stance against the corruption which is endemic here. Creel, a former elections official, fought for the democratic changes that enabled Fox's National Action Party to topple seven decades of single-party rule by the Institutional Revolutionary Party in July elections. Creel will take over an interior secretariat stripped of its police and spy duties and given the task of negotiating between the executive and Congress. Facing a Congress with no majority and a ruling party looking to make a comeback after losing the presidency for the first time since 1929, Creel will be instrumental in getting Fox's ambitious plans into law.

A new government took office at midnight, ending 71 years of ruling-party domination and beginning a day that some Mexicans have hoped for _ and others have feared _ for generations. Vicente Fox prepared to take the oath of the presidency Friday in an act that would mark the first peaceful transfer of power to an opposition party in Mexico's history. ``I feel like new,'' Fox said Thursday night. ``Filled with confidence, strength, serenity and the commitment to work for Mexico.'' The dawn of democracy here bred an enthusiasm that blurred, at least momentarily, ideological lines and political interests across the nation. Even the long-silent Zapatista rebel leader Subcomandante Marcos, hunkered down in the jungle of Mexico's southern Chiapas state, saw some hope. ``For us, the nightmare ends today,'' he wrote. ``Another could follow, or it could be a new dawn. We will do everything in our power to make that dawn flourish.'' Members of Fox's Cabinet, packed with businessmen, began to take over their new posts. Interior Secretary Santiago Creel, the man Fox picked to lead negotiations to reshape Mexico's shattered political landscape, assumed his duties in a midnight ceremony. Defense Secretary Gen. Ricardo Vega and Attorney General Gen. Rafael Macedo also were preparing to take office as the new day began. Fox himself was to be sworn in around midday. Like other new leaders in Latin America _ a region long riven by sharp extremes of right and left _ Fox came to power as an ideological hybrid, an energetic populist who courted everyone from street kids to corporate tycoons. That style, and the enthusiasm for Mexico's step toward democracy, was reflected in Fox's inauguration ceremonies. His first planned stop of the day was a breakfast with homeless children. Then it was on to a series of events that had him rubbing elbows with such obvious opposites as Cuban President Fidel Castro and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright _ and many others in between. Leaders of 15 Latin American countries were expected. Fox will need all of the above on board if he is to rebuild Mexico as promised. He inherits a country filled with poverty and corruption _ but also one with a new hope for the future. Hundreds of thousands of people were expected at the rallies Fox planned on his three-day inauguration tour of four Mexican cities, during which he will meet with peasants, Indians, artists and intellectuals. Fox has denied that his grandiose inauguration marked a return to the stark contrasts of state opulence and widespread poverty that prevailed before Mexico's 1910 revolution. Fox, a member of the right-of-center National Action Party, won office in July by defeating Francisco Labastida of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI. The PRI had dominated Mexican politics since 1929, and for party members Friday was a day as strange as it was unexpected. Out of power for the first time since it was founded, its leaders had to start thinking about how to handle the unfamiliar role of an opposition party.

Meanwhile, Mexico has a new President, conservative business man Vicente Fox took the oath of high office today in a day marked by hope and celebration. NPR's Gerry Hadden reports from Mexico City. Vicente Fox took to the congressional podium wearing the sash of the presidency and his trademark, cowboy boots. He told Mexicans, he would live up to his promise of change. Change after seven decades of single party rule. Fox and his National Action Party defeated the long ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party or PRI in a historical election last July. Fox has named a cabinet of business leaders, independent politicians and women, ending a long tradition of keeping power within the ruling party. Before Congress and a host of visiting dignitaries, Fox promised Mexico would keep its economy stable and open to world markets, and he would work to lift some 40 millions citizens out of poverty. Mexicans across the country are now readying for a weekend of festivities. Jerry Hadden, NPR News, Mexico city.

In a fitting end to a tournament that featured the top eight players in the world, this year's four Grand Slam winners are in the semifinals of the Masters Cup. The semifinals will match up two former top-ranked players against two young stars who have dominated the points race for the No. 1 position in the rankings. Pete Sampras, the dominant player of the last decade, was scheduled to face Gustavo Kuerten on Saturday, and Andre Agassi was to take on Marat Safin. Agassi began the year with a win at the Australian Open; Kuerten won the French Open; Sampras triumphed in Wimbledon; and Safin beat Sampras to win the U.S. Open in September. That loss was on Sampras' mind, especially since he had not played a tournament in between the U.S. Open and the Masters Cup. To reach the semis, Sampras had to beat Safin, who was already assured of a place in the semifinals. Sampras won 12 of the first 13 points of the match to set the tone, and Safin was never able to put up a challenge as Sampras won 6-3, 6-2 on Friday with an impressive display of vintage tennis. ``You always remember your losses much more than your wins,'' Sampras said. ``I'm a competitor. I wanted to get back at him. It's a big match _ either I win or go home.'' Sampras was in such command that an exasperated Safin smashed two rackets. ``When you realize that you have no chance at all, you cannot pass him at all, not down the line, not crosscourt, not lob, nothing, you understand you are doing something ridiculous,'' Safin said. The loss prevented Safin from clinching the No. 1 ranking for the year, but he can still do that by beating Agassi. Kuerten can still take the No. 1 from Safin, but he has to win the tournament and hope that the Russian loses Saturday. Kuerten reached the semis by beating Yevgeny Kafelnikov, the Olympic champion, 6-3, 6-4. ``I am not even thinking of No. 1,'' Kuerten said. ``I never expected to get this far and I am just trying to enjoy it.'' Agassi, the only unbeaten player in the last four, beat Magnus Norman 6-3, 6-2. He won the tournament in 1990. ``If we're playing our best, we're certainly very difficult to beat,'' Agassi said of himself and Sampras. ``We both won our groups and certainly this week we're stepping it up.'' Sampras is seeking a record sixth title in the season-ending event.

Cells in Turkey's new maximum-security prisons are bright and airy, featuring private bathrooms, small kitchens, dining tables, upstairs bedrooms and even doors that open out onto courtyards. To Justice Minister Hikmet Sami Turk, the two-story, three-man cells stand comparison to ``comfortable hotel rooms.'' To inmates, the cells are ``coffins.'' Hundreds of prisoners are now 50 days into a hunger strike to protest their planned transfer from the open wards that Turkey's inmates say offer their only protection _ safety in numbers _ against torture. ``We don't oppose the luxury, but we oppose the fact that they will leave the prisoners ... to the mercy of wardens,'' said Kamil Karatas, an advocate with an Ankara-based support group for prisoners' families. Since Oct. 20, about 800 prisoners in 14 prisons have refused all but sugared and salted water, supplemented with vitamin B tablets, to pressure the government to abandon the new cellblock prisons. In recent days, 138 of them have launched a ``death fast'' _ accepting plain water only. Still, the administration is adamant in its plans to dismantle Turkey's old prison system, where up to 100 inmates live in each cramped, dormitory-style ward. The ward system is widely acknowledged to block authorities from maintaining control in the prisons, contributing to frequent hostage-takings and riots. The government says leftist, Islamic and Kurdish groups run their own wards like indoctrination centers, smuggling in cellular phones and even arms. ``Our goal is to put an end to the sovereignty of armed groups in prison,'' Turk said. Political prisoners fear the cells will isolate them from their comrades, making them more vulnerable to abuse by authorities. Human rights groups say torture is common in Turkish prisons. Hunger strikes are a frequent _ and sometimes deadly _ form of protest in Turkey's prisons. In 1996, 12 inmates starved themselves to death before the government abandoned plans to transfer prisoners to remote jails where they faced solitary confinement. The latest strike has reached the point where even inmates still on sugared and salted water will start to see their health deteriorate seriously, said Dr. Umit Erkol of the Ankara Physicians Association. Erkol estimated inmates in previously good health could survive at least 60 days on sugar water. Many of the hunger-strikers already are suffering from headaches, cramps and vomiting, prisoners' relatives say. The government has warned it may force feed inmates whose lives are in greatest jeopardy. The newly built prison in Sincan, 25 miles west of the capital, Ankara, has 103 three-person cells and 58 one-person cells, equipped with only a toilet, a bed, a table and chair. The one-man cells are designed to house the more violent prisoners. The Sincan prison is one of six new prisons built at a cost of $4.5 million each. The government hopes to build five more and convert the country's nearly 700 other prisons. The prisons have gyms and libraries where the government says prisoners will be able to socialize. But rights activists say many will be kept in unrelenting solitary confinement. ``The right to socialize is a prisoner's right, but we fear that they will be deprived of this right as a form of punishment,'' said Husnu Ondul, who heads the Human Rights Association. London-based Amnesty International said imprisonment in small groups would have long-term effects on the prisoners' mental and physical health and ``may constitute cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment.'' The government is trying to draft an amnesty bill that would reduce the prison population and allow authorities to transform existing prisons into the cellblock-style jails. It is not clear how many of Turkey's 72,000 inmates would be released, but the pardon is certain to exclude about 10,000 political prisoners, such as Kurdish rebels fighting for autonomy in Turkey's southeast. The three parties in Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit's coalition government cannot agree on who should be released. Widespread public opposition to the amnesty also is making the task more difficult. Talk of early release has raised expectations among prisoners, who already have rioted at two prisons to demand amnesty. ``The prisons have become like bombs ready to explode,'' warned Mehmet Bekaroglu, a lawmaker with the pro-Islamic party.

Fearing Romania may be isolated if far-right candidate Corneliu Vadim Tudor succeeds in next weekend's runoff election for the presidency, the centrist Liberal Party on Sunday urged its supporters on Sunday to vote for the rival candidate. ``Vote against extremism, against Corneliu Vadim Tudor, in the second round of the presidential elections,'' said the deputy leader Valeriu Stoica after a meeting of the party's executive board. Tudor came second in the November presidential elections, finishing with 28 percent, behind front runner and former President Ion Iliescu with 36 percent. Parliamentary elections were held on the same day. The Liberal candidate, Theodor Stolojan, scored 11.78 percent and was third in the 12-candidate field. Romanian electoral law specifies that a presidential candidate must achieve 50 percent of the total electorate vote in the first round or contest a runoff with the second candidate. Many politicians and journalists, even those who oppose Iliescu, a former high-ranking Communist official, have called on Romanians to reject Tudor in the Dec. 10 runoff. They fear that if Tudor wins, Romania would be economically and politically isolated from the Europe of prosperous democracies it wants to join. Tudor says he is pro-European and supports democracy, but his comments have often been extremist and racist. Over the years, Tudor has painted himself as a champion of the Romanian people, fighting against the Gypsy ``Mafia,'' Hungarian ``Irredentists'' and ``dirty Jews.'' He has recently toned down his racist rhetoric and has won acclaim for his verbal war against official corruption. Iliescu's party has rejected an offer of forming a coalition government with Tudor's Greater Romania party. Iliescu is the favorite in the runoff, but the race is expected to be close. No polls have been published, and there will be no television debates between the two candidates ahead of the election.

Fearing Romania may be isolated if far-right candidate Corneliu Vadim Tudor succeeds in next weekend's runoff election for the presidency, the centrist Liberal Party on Sunday urged its supporters to vote for former President Ion Iliescu. ``Vote against extremism, against Corneliu Vadim Tudor, in the second round of the presidential elections,'' said the deputy leader Valeriu Stoica after a meeting of the party's executive board. Tudor came in second in the November presidential elections, finishing with 28 percent, behind front runner Iliescu, who had with 36 percent. Parliamentary elections were held on the same day.

In an era when an American president beguiles crowds in Vietnam, and China is a key trading partner, U.S. policy-makers still need to be reminded of their victory over communism when talk turns to Cuba. Cuba's transition to a free-market democracy is inevitable, a bipartisan task force of the Council on Foreign Relations declared in a report issued Wednesday. The committee asserted that the United States should move faster to open and increase a variety of contacts. Yet whenever Washington focuses on that nearby island with 11 million people, peculiar things happen. Reason slips, tempers flare. And the custodians of the current hard-line policy are out of sync with the general public, which increasingly favors a less hostile stance toward Havana. In October, Republican leaders stymied votes in both houses to open Cuba to more trade and travel. The bill finally signed by the president legalized the sale of food but denied vital funding; rather than increase travel, it froze current restrictions by codifying them into law. Rep. Mark Sanford, R-S.C., got a taste of the Cuba warp last summer, when he had won broad support for a measure to let Americans visit the island freely. After the vote, he sought to clear the air with his long-time ally, Tom DeLay, the Republican whip, who remains an ardent foe of any softening toward Havana. What he got was a nasty fight. The two men turned red in the face as they screamed at each other. The spectacle on the House floor left staffers awkwardly staring at their shoes. Later, in conference, DeLay helped kill Sanford's bill. After four decades of seeking to topple, discredit and isolate the Cuban leader, Fidel Castro, the defense of the current U.S. policy increasingly relies on strong-arm tactics and back-room deals. Meanwhile, surveys show most Americans want a new approach. They want more interaction and trade. A recent poll by Florida International University found 80 percent of Americans would support a dialogue with the Cuban government. They favor the sale of food (86 percent) and medicine (90 percent). A key recommendation by the council task force urged opening Cuba to travel by all Americans. Some people aren't waiting on Washington. Though officially barred from spending money in Cuba, an estimated 22,000 Americans illegally flew in as tourists from third countries last year. An additional 135,000 took part in authorized visits for academic, cultural and family exchanges. The custody battle over 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez forced Americans to focus on Cuba for the first time in years, and many came to question the tactics of Cuban exile leaders, who have long had great influence over U.S.-Cuban relations. ``The people are way ahead of the politicians on this issue,'' said Sen. Byron L. Dorgan, D-N.D., who hopes to end the sanctions in the next Congress. Two powerful lobbies, the American Farm Bureau and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, are seeking to open up trade with Cuba. Leaders in both groups say they will press for what they say could represent a billion-dollar market for U.S. food products alone. Even some longtime supporters of sanctions see the change. ``The consensus has moved on U.S. policy toward Cuba,'' said Dan Fisk, a former Senate aide who was instrumental in drafting the 1996 Helms-Burton Act, which tightened the embargo, but is now a signatory on the council report. The next president will witness the dismantling of efforts to isolate Castro, Fisk predicted. Both Gov. George W. Bush and Vice President Al Gore oppose eliminating all sanctions against Cuba while Castro is in power, leaving many analysts to foresee a piecemeal approach. But economists in federal agencies like the Agriculture Department and the International Trade Commission are now working on studies that forecast the economic impact of lifting sanctions. Even among Cuban Americans, attitudes are changing. A majority favors selling food and medicine to Cuba, polls show, though most exiles voice support for the embargo. Elena Freyre, executive director of the Cuban Committee for Democracy, a liberal group, complained that exile lawmakers are out of step, catering only to the most intransigent, and best-financed, elements of the community. ``The people who purport to represent that community are no longer doing so,'' she said. But the battle must still be decided in Congress. In 1996, pro-embargo lawmakers _ nervous about President Bill Clinton's intentions _ stripped him of discretionary powers over the sanctions. Some seasoned political fighters stand in the way. Among them is DeLay. His antipathy stems in part, aides say, from a jarring incident when he was a boy: gun-toting Cuban troops boarded his airliner during a stopover in Havana on a flight from Venezuela to the United States. And there are the two Cuban-American lawmakers from Miami, Rep. Lincoln Diaz-Balart and Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, who seem unyielding when it comes to Castro. In a political system oiled by compromise, such fervor can bring the process to a halt. ``The leadership has made a mockery of the democratic process,'' said Wayne S. Smith, a former diplomat in Havana. ``For so long we have allowed our policy to be dictated from Miami against the will of a majority of the American people and a majority in Congress.'' Sanford said the Cuban exile lobby has kept lawmakers in line with generous campaign contributions. ``The answer, in part, is money,'' he said. ``I've had people tell me, `Hey, just take a quick trip to Miami and you're home $10,000 richer, in time for lunch.''' Pro-embargo Cuban exiles and their allies say they are taking a moral stand against a repressive regime. The Cuban American National Foundation, the leading exile lobby, asserts that Castro is working with American ``apologists'' and multinational firms to ``place tainted profits before principle.'' Yet with American business leaders vowing to revisit the policy, the deep-pocketed exile lobby may have met its match. Jack Laurie, vice president of the American Farm Bureau Federation, said his group will ultimately prevail. ``We probably didn't realize the intensity of feelings of Cuban Americans,'' he said. ``I'm sensitive to some of what they're saying. But by the same token, 40 years is a long time to harbor the same position.''

President Vladimir Putin's proposal that Russia adopt the music of the Soviet anthem as its national hymn will only divide the country, Russian liberals wrote in an open letter Tuesday. The Russian Orthodox Church, meanwhile, said it approved of the plan and the anthem ``restored and demonstrated'' continuity in Russian history, the Interfax news agency reported. The church, a harsh critic of the Soviet era, was expected to oppose the anthem. Putin on Monday called for establishing the music, written by Alexander Alexandrov, as Russia's official anthem. He also proposed making the familiar white, red and blue flag the official flag and bringing back a Soviet-era red banner as the military's flag. The symbols must be approved by the lower house of parliament, the State Duma, which is to discuss the issue Friday. The Duma already has given first-reading approval to reinstating the anthem. Putin praised the music by Alexandrov because it inspired generations of Soviet athletes to strive for gold, was played for the first man in space and honored the victory over Nazi Germany in World War II. Polls show most Russians like the Soviet anthem, Putin said. But in an open letter published Tuesday in the Izvestia newspaper, prominent Russian writers and intellectuals said they heard a different story in the stirring chords _ one of political repression and labor camps. The music should be retired for good, they said. ``The head of state should realize that millions of countrymen, including those who voted for him, will never respect an anthem trampling on their convictions and insulting the memory of victims of Soviet political reprisals,'' the liberals wrote. Also, the music is used by the Russian Communist Party _ without words _ to represent their movement, and therefore cannot be used as an anthem for all Russians, they said. The music is ``one of the most striking symbols of the bygone epoch and no new lyrics will be able to erase the words attached to it that forever glorify Lenin and Stalin,'' they wrote. Communist leader Vladimir Lenin and dictator Josef Stalin are directly praised in the original lyrics. Putin has suggested replacing the lines with mention of a Russian eagle, but did not suggest exact phrasing.

Flanked by Secret Service agents and pursued by a throng of reporters, Sen.-elect Hillary Rodham Clinton made the short trip Tuesday from the White House to Capitol Hill for an orientation dubbed ``Senate School.'' The first lady joined 10 other freshman senators for a whirlwind day of seminars, tours and class photos, capped off with a formal dinner at the Supreme Court building. Her date: the president. The Senate's most famous new face kept a decidedly low profile most of the day, seemingly intent on ensuring she wouldn't overshadow other freshmen. Capitol Police kept reporters away as she moved between meetings. ``It's been great,'' was all Clinton would say as she rushed into the Senate lunch, a huge smile on her face. At one point, as photographers penned behind a rope line craned for a view of her leaving the Old Senate Chamber, the first lady and her Secret Service detail ducked down one of the Capitol's many back corridors. ``She's done a very good job of trying not to single herself out or act in a way that appears to be self-promotive,'' said New Jersey Sen.-elect Jon Corzine, a Democrat who spent a record $65 million to win his seat. Sen.-elect Debbie Stabenow, D-Mich., agreed. ``She has been really sensitive to the fact that a lot of focus comes with her being here and I think she's really working hard to be a member of the team and not to be the center of attention,'' said Stabenow, who is now a member of the House. Clinton is among a record four women in this year's 11-member freshman class. The class includes nine Democrats, two Republicans, three millionaires, three governors and a widow. Incoming senator Jean Carnahan was appointed Monday by Missouri Gov. Roger Wilson to replace her husband, Gov. Mel Carnahan, who was killed Oct. 16 in a plane crash but beat incumbent Republican John Ashcroft on Election Day anyway. The appointment will take effect Jan. 3. Carnahan, who like Clinton has never held public office, said she chatted with the first lady during orientation. ``She's looking for housing, like we are,'' Carnahan told reporters before entering the office of Missouri's senior senator, Republican Kit Bond. The nine freshman Democrats began the day at 8:30 a.m. with coffee in Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle's office. They then trailed Daschle, D-S.D., to Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott's office for more coffee. Lott, R-Miss., struck a more conciliatory tone toward Clinton than he had shortly after her election, when he said she'd ``have to get used'' to being one of 100 members. ``When she raises her hand and says, `I do,' she's a senator. And she'll be treated accordingly,'' Lott said Tuesday. ``And she, I'm sure, is going to be a very diligent senator, work hard, get committee assignments where she has a real interest, and will be a very important part of this body, just like every other senator is.'' Clinton has expressed an interest in serving on the Finance, Appropriations and Education committees, but it's unclear what she might get. The incoming senators attended a seminar on life in the Senate that addressed ``issues such as staffing, scheduling, early frustrations and common mistakes.'' Then they received a tutorial by the Senate's unofficial historian, Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., on the formation and history of the Senate. A photo session for Talk magazine occurred before dinner. President Clinton skipped the luncheon for the income senators' spouses, largely because of the immense security that would have been needed in the Capitol. Mrs. Clinton's spokesman, Howard Wolfson, said she spent much of the day awe-struck by her new job. ``She was excited,'' he said. ``She sounded like she was going to her first day of school.'' Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, said Clinton will not be judged by her past run-ins with the GOP. ``I think she certainly comes with more awareness and notoriety than most incoming freshmen senators, but I think she will be accepted for what she decides to be and I don't think any of her past differences will be an issue,'' Hutchison said. ``I think she will go forward with a blank slate and she will make her career.''

The two-year-long war between Ethiopia and Eritrea is over, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan declared Wednesday after talks with senior Ethiopian officials. A treaty to be signed in Algeria on Dec. 12 is expected to open the way for demarcation of the disputed 620-mile-long border between the two African countries, the exchange of prisoners and the release of detained civilians, he said. ``This is a positive story for Africa, and I'm really happy that we're ending the year with the story of peace,'' said Annan, who met with Prime Minister Meles Zenawi after arriving in Addis Ababa late Tuesday as part of an eight-day African tour. Meles said his government would approve the peace package drafted by the Organization of African Unity. ``I am optimistic and confident that this is a final stage of the whole process,'' he said. War broke out in May 1998 when Eritrea, which had gained independence from Ethiopia five years earlier after three decades of guerrilla warfare, moved into what Ethiopians considered their territory. The border between Eritrea, a nation of 3.5 million on the Red Sea coast, and Ethiopia, its much larger landlocked neighbor of 60 million, has never been formally outlined. Ethiopia launched a final offensive into Eritrea in May, forcing some 1 million Eritreans to flee at a time when drought threatened to kill hundreds of thousands of people. Neither country has made the number of deaths public, but the loss is estimated to number in the tens of thousands. In June, the two countries agreed to cease hostilities after mediation by Algeria, the OAU and President Clinton's special envoy Anthony Lake. On Monday, Eritrea expressed satisfaction with provisions to investigate the causes of the war, to demarcate the border and to establish a commission to hear claims for compensation for war damages. The United Nations has already begun deploying a 4,220-strong U.N. peacekeeping and military observer mission in both countries, and hopes to have the full force in place by the end of January. ``As soon as our work is done, we will withdraw,'' Annan said. On Wednesday, 150 Dutch troops arrived in the Eritrean capital, Asmara, to monitor the temporary security zone from which all Ethiopian and Eritrean troops must withdraw. Under the June 18 agreement, the U.N. force will supervise the withdrawal of Ethiopian soldiers from areas that were not under their administration before the war broke out, as well as the pullback of Eritreans to 15 miles from current positions. An air corridor for U.N. aircraft to travel between the two countries has not yet opened and the exact boundary of the 15-mile U.N.-controlled buffer zone has not been drawn. Annan, who will attend the treaty signing, urged both countries to provide maps of mine fields across the former front lines ``as soon as possible'' so U.N. troops can move in faster to secure peace. Ethiopian and Eritrean commanders agreed over the weekend to provide detailed maps by next week.

A Moscow judge handed down the maximum sentence of 20 years at hard labor against a former U.S. naval intelligence officer, Edmond Pope, on Wednesday after a seven-week espionage trial behind closed doors. The 54-year-old businessman was accused in April of obtaining secret plans and technical reports for a torpedo, the Shkval, or Squall in English, a rocket-propelled underwater projectile that travels at 230 mph. The verdict marked the first espionage conviction against a Westerner in Russia in the decade since the end of the Cold War, though both Moscow and Washington have expelled alleged spies from each other's capitals in recent years. The Clinton administration immediately condemned the verdict and called on President Vladimir Putin to release Pope because he suffers from a rare form of bone cancer. ``The verdict is unjustifiable, it is flat-out wrong, and it has cast a shadow over our relationship,'' a White House spokesman, P.J. Crowley, said in Washington. ``We remain very concerned that his health has deteriorated in recent days,'' Crowley said, though he provided no details. ``We have been making clear to the Russian government that they should move to release Mr. Pope on humanitarian grounds.'' It seemed clear that although further legal appeals are possible, the fate of Pope is most likely to be decided on the scales of diplomatic relations as Putin prepares to do business with a new U.S. president. The trial's conclusion allows Putin to say that he backed the tough line of his security forces in protecting secrets, while he could garner credit internationally by freeing Pope. The judge, Nina Barkova, read out the 20-page judgment as Pope stood in a steel cage, holding hands through the bars with his wife, Cheri, who looked somber and distraught in a red sweater and navy-blue jacket. During the reading of the verdict, Pope shook his head repeatedly in disbelief, his lawyer said, as the judge dismissed all defense arguments. Pope's congressman, John Peterson, R-Pa., was also present during the reading of the verdict and later condemned the secret proceeding. ``It is astounding that no American has ever seen the charges and no American was allowed to see the trial,'' he said. The congressman mocked the evidence that had been cited, saying that Pope's alleged profile as a spy was buttressed by Russian claims that he was a member of the Navy Credit Union and the American Legion. ``I now call on President Putin and President Clinton to resolve this issue so there is a future for our two countries,'' Peterson said. Pope's lawyer, Pavel Astakhov, failed during the trial to convince Barkova that the information Pope purchased for $28,000 from Professor Anatoly Babkin of Moscow's Bauman State Technical University was also available in textbooks and other unclassified _ or ``open'' _ reference sources in Russia. The Squall torpedo's designer, Genrikh Uvarov, who testified at the trial and who agreed that much, but not all, of the information that was part of the transaction was open or unclassified, according to Astakhov's account, has in recent years been a booster for selling the Squall technology to foreigners. (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) Writing in Military Parade magazine in April 1996, Uvarov invited ``foreign companies'' to work with Russia ``to carry out mutual research and design work'' on ``various versions of high-speed underwater rockets'' based on the Squall. But Mr. Uvarov testified that Babkin may have offered Pope too much information on the secrets of the Squall's rocket fuel, according to Astakhov, who challenged that assertion in court. (END OPTIONAL TRIM) After final arguments by the lawyers, Pope defended himself, pointing out to the judge that before coming to Russia, he had taken care to draft a contract with Bauman State Technical University that provided that no secret information was to be included in the transaction. ``Although I spent eight months in prison in Russia, I am not a spy,'' he declared, according to his lawyer. ``The only decision that you must make is to let me go home to my family.'' Pope's lawyer also questioned on Wednesday how the judge could have written a 20-page verdict in two-and-a-half hours after closing arguments were concluded, suggesting that the guilty verdict was pre-ordained by higher authorities. (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) He called Barkova's opinion ``biased and unjust'' and compared her judicial behavior to the Stalin era. ``We haven't seen that kind of thing since 1937,'' he said, adding, ``This case will go down in the history of jurisprudence for the number of mistakes committed.'' (END OPTIONAL TRIM) Pope has seven days to appeal the verdict to Russia's supreme court, and his lawyer said no decision had been made. He also said he was aware of discussions of the case within the Russian government, but that a political decision would have to be made by Putin. The Russian president gave no reaction to the verdict, but last week Putin issued a decree, the text of which has not been published, setting forth new procedures to license and regulate the sale of military technologies. nn One of the problems throughout the closed proceeding was that all public characterizations of the evidence presented against Pope came from U.S. officials and Pope's defense lawyer, who has asserted at times that key witnesses have recanted all or part of their testimonies. These assertions have been impossible to verify because most of the witnesses have been enjoined from speaking to foreign reporters, or are simply afraid to because of the climate the case has created. Astakhov told reporters on Wednesday that if the court record proves that Pope did receive classified information, ``it is not the problem of a private businessman, but a problem of Russia'' to clarify laws on the handling of state secrets. A senior official of Russia's counter-intelligence service, Gen. Alexsander Zdanovich, said on state television Wednesday night that he was pleased with the verdict and that the full weight of the Russian government's evidence has yet to be made public. ``Russia has its secrets and we will do our best to protect them,'' he said, adding, ``I must say that when the verdict comes into force we will make public some more facts and we will make a film so that people can make their own judgment.'' Pope was arrested along with a colleague, Daniel H. Kielly, 68, of Penn State University's Applied Research Laboratory, where Pope also worked on projects related to naval weapons development. For some reason, Kielly was set free and allowed to return to the United States. Babkin, 70, was also arrested and charged with divulging state secrets. But he has not been put on trial due to a heart problem. Babkin was a witness for the prosecution, and a statement by the professor was entered saying that he had given Pope classified information about the manufacture of the Shkval's rocket fuel. Later, according to Astakhov, Babkin said the statement was given under duress just prior to the first of two heart attacks. Babkin has not spoken publicly to confirm or deny his testimony against Pope, but his wife, speaking in a television interview during the trial, said his statements to investigators were made under pressure. Russian security officers have denied that they pressured Babkin, and they said that his statement was taken in the presence of an attorney and his interrogation was videotaped. After Wednesday's verdict, Cheri Pope hugged her husband through the bars to say goodbye. She left the courtroom without commenting. Her congressman, Peterson, said that she was too ``angry'' to make a public statement. On Tuesday, she expressed the fear that her husband might die in a Russian prison. On state television late Wednesday, Pope made his first public remarks from Moscow's Lefortovo Prison. Smiling and appearing to be in good form notwithstanding the verdict, he said without rancor and in reply to a question that if he were pardoned he would like to return to Russia, ``but I am afraid that my wife wouldn't let me.'' He said the 246-day ordeal since his arrest has been ``too hard'' on his wife, ``too hard on my family.'' Nonetheless, he continued, he has deep respect for Russia and expressed no regret about coming to Russia to do business. ``I regret what's happened to me, but I don't regret coming to Russia,'' he said, ``I have gained a huge experience of meeting people.'' He also talked of Russia and the United States ``getting old together'' and ``learning how to cooperate with each other.''

In Ivory Coast's neighbor to the east, another more orderly election campaign concluded today. Jerry Rowlings has been the leader of Ghana for nearly 20 years. But the country's constitution prohibits him from serving another term. So Rowling's Vice President John Atta Mills is running under the ruling party's banner. But Mills doesn't have this one in the bag at all. The BBC's Mark Doyle sent us this report. We are driving at breakneck speed with the convoy of the main opposition candidate John Kofoa. It's a convoy made up of luxury four-wheel drive vehicles Mercedes, saloon cars and rickety old taxis and buses with some supporters in as well. Mr. Kofoa is putting on a very confident face as you'd expect from an opposition politician, but there is no doubt that he doesn't have a chance in this election. It's the closest fought election that's ever been held in Ghana. Once we reach the main opposition party rally, it was time for speeches knocking the government and extolling the virtues of change after Jerry Rowling's two decades of rule. Ghana has a well-informed electorate, but the political sophistication of this country doesn't mean that some pretty basic accusations haven't been flying. Samuel Odoi Sikes is the Chairman of the main opposition National Patriotic Party, and he says the ruling party has been bribing voters. They know what you like, like if you go to the Funtiland that is the Kikus central and western region, they give them milk, they give them sardines, they give them beef. When they come to Accra, they give them corn, they give them fish, you know, and just to persuade the people or to induce the people to vote for them. Most Ghanaians would add that the opposition politicians are not averse to using the odd electoral sweep either. Praise singers at the final rally of the ruling National Democratic Party. Its main hitch is that Jerry Rowlings and his team have stabilized the economy and are a proven quantity. Speaker after speaker said Ghana was now a modern country with real prospects and that entrusting this legacy to the opposition was a risk. Hudo Yahya is the General Secretary of the ruling party that's looking for another four-year term. Well, everybody thinks he's best but that is subjective. But objectively our party has delivered the goods and that is why we think that we should be voted for. I mean, we brought this country out of the woods. The average voter in Ghana is very poor. This underdeveloped country still relies on primary exports, cocoa and gold for most of its foreign exchange. But there is another side to this place, the Christ The King church in the center of the capital. Although these elections have highlighted political divisions, it's also true that Ghana's civil society, its local communities are strong and resilient. Ghanaians are great joiners and joining a church service is one of their favorite pastimes. Let's, you know, take an example of the elections and what is coming around. When I look at the importance of the church, the importance of Christ's life, what he means his teachings to me, then I see that then I should vote for a leader who has the ordinary person at heart. So that's actually what I am looking for and what I hope my votes will achieve. The BBC's Mark Doyle filed that report from Ghana.

Lifts on Kitzsteinhorn glacier reopened to skiers Thursday, one month after a deadly fire in a cable car tunnel killed 155 people in Austria. The gondola lift began carrying skiers from the village of Kaprun to the glacier at 8 a.m., the Austria Press Agency reported. The lift was stopped after a deadly fire broke out Nov. 11 in a cable car heading up a tunnel through the mountainside, killing 155 people from Austria, Germany, the United States, Japan, Slovenia, the Netherlands and the Czech Republic. Officials in Kaprun waited for the bodies of the victims to be identified before reopening the lifts. In addition, the fire caused extensive damage to water and energy cables that ran through the tunnel and had to be repaired. Extra safety measures were also taken before starting up the lifts again, APA said. Extensive investigations are continuing to try to establish the cause of the fire.

apart from the florida contest, other news tonight. another major concern in washington, a growing threat by terrorists against america's top national security officials. and behind the threats, osama bin laden, the wealthy saudi arabian who most experts consider the most dangerous terrorist in the world today. nbc's andrea mitchell tonight with exclusive new information on the threat and the response. andrea? tom, tonight congress is being asked to spend millions of dollars for protecting secretary of state madeleine albright for six months after she leaves office because of terrorist threats. madeleine albright the target, say security officials, of specific threats that won't disappear once she leaves office. the higher level of threats, one of the subjects covered in george bush's first cia briefing yesterday. and the warning ought to be that as we decide this election people should not try to take advantage of our nation. threats that start with the embassy bombings in africa two years ago accelerate with nato's attack on yugoslavia, become even more deadly this year when officials say osama bin laden puts albright at the top of his assassination list. and then two months ago the attack on the "uss cole." the vulnerability and the threats don't end automatically upon leaving office. in fact cia director george tenet says tonight the u.s. is vulnerable at home not just abroad. we're in an environment where we're literally inundated with threat warnings all the time. making sense of disparate facts sometimes is very difficult to do in a timely manner. officials tell nbc news defense secretary bill cohen was also targeted. two incidents on a trip last month to the middle east, where intelligence officials say the violence raging between israel and palestinians feeds anti-u.s. fervor. despite the threats, critics say round-the-clock security for former officials is a bad precedent. we may be going overboard here a little bit. before we start doing something like this, i want to be sure why we are doing it, because there is a big cost. still top officials say that round-the-clock protection will be offered to the next secretary of state, possibly colin powell in a bush white house, as soon as he is nominated. tom? thanks andrea mitchell tonight.

The United States and Russia asked the Security Council on Thursday to toughen and broaden sanctions against the Taliban government of Afghanistan, measures that would cut the country off from most contact with the world. The common ground taken by the Russians and Americans in demonizing the Taliban follows their taking exactly opposite sides in the catastrophic civil war that followed a Soviet invasion in 1979. A coalition of holy warriors, supplied by the United States, eventually drove Russian troops out. But a decade later, in a surprising reversal, the Russians are arming these very warriors because they are fighting Moscow's new enemy, the Taliban. The agreement by the Russians and Americans on sanctions is also rare. They both are concerned about the Taliban's influence across Central Asia and beyond, concluding that the Islamic movement supports Muslim militancy and international terrorism. Both Moscow and Washington discount fears that the new sanctions could harden the Taliban's position and ruin prospects of a negotiated settlement of the Afghan civil war. Sergey Lavrov, the Russian representative, told reporters on Thursday that the new measures would leave ``ample room'' for peace talks to continue, a point also made by American officials. ``The problem is that the Taliban never delivered on a single promise, be this to start the dialogue, be this to stop fighting, be this to treat women and girls properly, or any other demand from the Security Council to stop the support for terrorism,'' Lavrov said. Russians accuse the Taliban of involvement in the war in Chechnya. The United States is focused on the sanctuary in Afghanistan of the Saudi-born financier of militancy, Osama bin Laden, who is wanted in the United States on charges of being behind the bombings of two American embassies in Africa in 1998. Reaction from the Taliban was swift. In Afghanistan, a minister of the Islamic movement called bin Laden ``a guest and the upholder of the Afghan holy war'' and said the Taliban could not be forced to hand him over. In New York, the Taliban's representative, who may be forced to leave the United States under the new sanctions, said the proposed measures had more to do with Russian policy in Central Asia than the situation in Afghanistan. He went on to predict that the country would close ranks against outsiders and become more defiant. In the Russian-American resolution, which is almost certain to pass in the next week or two, the council would demand the closing of all Taliban diplomatic offices around the world and those of Afghanistan's national airline, Ariana. All flights to or from landlocked Afghanistan, except for relief missions and religious pilgrimages, would be banned. A comprehensive arms embargo would be imposed on the Taliban, but not on the opposition army of former American-backed mujahideen struggling to keep a foothold in about 5 percent of the country. To curb the production of heroin in Afghanistan, the world's biggest opium grower, the sale of a chemical used in the making of heroin, acetic anhydride, would be banned. Current sanctions restrict some flights of the Afghan airline and block off any Taliban financial assets abroad. The Russian-American resolution demands not only the surrender of bin Laden, whose financial assets would be frozen worldwide, but also the closing of all training camps for Islamic militants. Sanctions would not end until all conditions were met. Russian and American diplomats, seeking Beijing's support, have told the Chinese that these camps also send fighters to Muslim areas of China. India accuses the Taliban of involvement in the war in Kashmir. At the insistence of France, which is wary of imposing any more open-ended sanctions, like those on Iraq, the new measures would have to be reviewed after a year. Abdul Hakeem Mujahid, the representative in New York of the Taliban, who have been denied the U.N. seat still held by the mujahideen opposition, said that the actions would increase sympathy for the Taliban across the Islamic world. At the moment, the Taliban do not get the support of Muslim nations that the Palestinians do, for example. ``The U.S. and U.N. are claiming championship of human rights all over the world and at the same time they are killing our people with hunger,'' he said. ``Now they want to prolong the war. They encourage the opposition to fight against the central government.''

Reports from Russia say there may be a presidential pardon in store for Edmund Pope, the American convicted yesterday in Moscow on spying charges. The head of Russia's Presidential Pardons Commission says the commission would recommend that President Vladimir Putin free Pope. The commission is expected to take up Pope's case tomorrow. A Moscow court sentenced Pope to 20 years in prison for allegedly trying to buy secret information about a high-speed Russian submarine. Pope maintains that he is innocent and says he should be released because he is suffering from a rare form of bone cancer.

This is The World. I am Tony Kahn. Gao Xingjian arrived in Stockholm this week and when he leaves the Chinese born writer will have something extra in his suitcase, the Nobel Prize for literature. Today Gao, who now lives in France, gave the traditional Nobel lecture as part of the festivities leading up to Sunday's ceremony, and on the same day he collects the prize. Gao's 1989 novel 'Soul Mountain' will be published for the first time in America. If you want to know what Gao Xingjian is all about, as a thinker and as an artist, our international book citric Christopher Meryl says Gao's masterpiece is an ideal starting point. His politics are embedded in his writing and his writing is first and foremost a celebration of freedom. This novel 'Soul Mountain', which is just being released in the United States this week is in every possible way a celebration of what freedom means. It's a large novel, full of all kinds of ideas and incidents and stories and tales and a polyphony of voices. It is, if you like, the whole world wrapped up in 500 pages. It is the world at its most carnival-like. And yet it is virtually impossible, isn't it, for a Chinese artist to do something or to make a statement without it's having some kind of either political effect or be political in origin. I mean this man took the trip on which the novel was based for political reasons, did he not? Certainly. He is born in 1940. He is a product of the Cultural Revolution. In fact he had to burn up an entire suitcase full of hundreds of poems and plays and stories at the start of the Cultural Revolution in fear of going to prison. And then in 1983 after being diagnosed with lung cancer, which had killed his father three years earlier and being convinced that he himself was going to die, he gets a kind of reprieve. He gets a second chest x-ray, discovers that he doesn't have lung cancer, recognizes that by virtue of the kinds of things that he is writing, his openness to western literary ideas, that he is in political trouble again. And so he sets out on an extraordinary odyssey of some 15,000 kilometers, mostly on foot, which he takes through southwestern China. He had survived, if you will, a death sentence, and now in that new freedom of the life in front of him, he takes to the road in the tradition of old Chinese poets and records what he sees, what he hears, the stories that he is told. The book is filled with marvelous descriptions of the gorges through which he walks, the mountains that he climbs, indeed the book is called Soul Mountain, the mountain on which he hopes in some way or another to get in touch with his soul, his individual soul, as opposed to that mass kind of soul being enforced upon him by the Communist Chinese authorities, the social realism that the cadres would have him write in. Not only can this fellow write, he can paint too, can't he? He is best known among his neighbors in Paris as a painter. He has had more than 31 man shows and his paintings are quite delicately done and there he is also very well known as a playwright. I think he has published about 18 plays now and he writes his plays in French. Just one last thing quoting him and I wonder if you could respond to this, Christopher. He said at the very beginning of his wonderful speech to the Nobel Prize Committee. He said, "I do not wish to waste this talk on literature by saying too much about politics and history. What I want to do is to use this opportunity to speak as one writer in the voice of an individual." Is that true basically not only for him that day, today, but of all of his work? Well, the work that we have so far in English translation suggests that, and indeed this novel, which is a celebration as well of the self of the individual, goes so far as to even divide up to the self. Characters proliferate out of the imagination of the narrator so that you have at a certain point, you have a new he, you have a new she, you have a you, and each one of these characters tells stories, each story of which is designed to give you a deeper sense of the richness and the complexity of life in China. Christopher Meryl is Director of the International Writing Program at the University of Iowa and our international book citric. Thanks, Christopher. Thank you.

Taiwan will release the pilots of a Singapore Airlines jet that crashed in October while taking off on the wrong runway, a prosecutor said Friday. The three men will be allowed to go home on Dec. 15. The decision came after numerous complaints from pilots, officials and crash investigators who argued that detaining the pilots for so long was unnecessary. Taoyuan District prosecutor Song Keo-yeh had said the pilots were needed for the legal probe of the Oct. 31 crash, which killed 83 of the 179 people aboard the Singapore Airlines jumbo jet. But on Friday, Song announced their impending release. ``When they are needed again for the investigation, Singapore's representative office in Taiwan has an obligation to return them to Taiwan,'' he told reporters. So far, crash investigators have confirmed that the plane crashed because the pilots tried to take off on a closed runway littered with construction equipment. The ongoing investigation has not formally concluded that pilot error caused the crash. Investigators are still trying to figure out why the pilots decided to use the wrong runway. Taiwan's chief crash investigator, Kay Yong of the Aviation Safety Council, has criticized the prosecutor's decision to detain the pilots for so long. On Friday, an airline official who also had been critical of the long detentions applauded the release announcement. ``We are naturally very elated that the guys are coming back to Singapore and we appreciate it,'' said Capt. Ryan Goh, who heads Singapore Airlines' chapter of the International Federation of Airline Pilots Associations. He said ``they'll be happy enough to return to Taiwan to assist'' the investigation. The three pilots are flight commander Capt. Foong Chee Kong, 41, a Malaysian, and Singaporean co-pilots Latif Cyrano, 36, and Ng Kheng Leng, 38.

Russia's presidential pardons commission recommended on Friday that President Vladimir Putin free U.S. prisoner Edmond Pope, who was convicted of spying earlier in the week and sentenced to 20 years in prison. ``Pope is a sick man who has gone through a lot, and he should be let go,'' commission head Anatoly Pristavkin said. Pristavkin had said earlier that Putin usually abides by the committee's recommendations, and on Friday he said he expects the president to act quickly. But other members of the commission cautioned that the president could not pardon Pope until the trial court's verdict goes into effect in seven days. In Washington, White House national security spokesman P.J. Crowley said ``it remains our position that Edmond Pope should be released, and we hope that President Putin will act on the recommendation of the commission.'' Pope, 54, was convicted of espionage Wednesday despite his claims of innocence and sentenced to a maximum-security prison. He and his family have begged for a pardon, saying they fear the bone cancer he suffered has returned. Pardons commission member Marietta Chudakova said Friday's unanimous decision by the commission was a protest against ``alarming signs in the atmosphere today.'' ``The investigative and judicial organs of our country have remained in the Soviet era to a greater extent than society (as a whole),'' the Interfax news agency quoted her as saying. Pristavkin said members of the pardons commission had found the court's verdict quite harsh. ``But we do not judge or discuss the court's decision, but instead base our actions on the laws of charity and humanity,'' he said. Pope, from State College, Pa., is a former naval officer and the founder of CERF Technologies, International, which specializes in studying foreign maritime equipment. At his Moscow trial, Russia's Federal Security Service said he had illegally obtained classified plans for a high-speed underwater torpedo, the Shkval. On Thursday, Pope appealed to Putin to free him. ``This letter is my appeal to free me from prison to enable me to return to Pennsylvania to join my family and to improve my health,'' Pope's lawyer, Pavel Astakhov, quoted the letter as saying. ``I feel bad and need urgent medical aid,'' Astakhov read from a Russian translation of the letter. ``I appeal to you, asking you to resolve the question as soon as possible, as my father is terminally ill and I would like to see him for the last time.'' The case has cast a shadow over U.S.-Russian relations ever since Pope was arrested April 3 and jailed in Moscow's foreboding Lefortovo Prison. Pope has insisted on his innocence, saying the technology he obtained was not secret because it had already been sold abroad and published in open sources. Pope's defense lawyers said the court was heavily biased in favor of the Federal Security Service, and the U.S. government said the Russian prosecutors had failed to prove their case. Pope's supporters also have pressed for humanitarian intervention because of Pope's fragile health. Pope has suffered from a rare form of bone cancer which was in remission when he traveled to Russia. He also has high blood pressure, says his wife, Cheri. She said Thursday she is ``hoping and praying right now that President Putin, when he promised us that he would help, that it would be very soon and I can take my husband home.'' Putin had said during a visit to the United States in September that Pope's judicial process would have to be completed before he would intervene. Russian media have noted that his stance has allowed the security services to flex their muscles while leaving the way open for him to demonstrate humaneness. The Segodnya daily wrote Friday that the Kremlin could ``kill several birds with one stone'' by giving the U.S. administration the gift of Pope's freedom. ``The FSB can save face, Putin can demonstrate that he's not beholden to outside pressure and Russian scientists are given a lesson about the consequences of 'para-scientific' contacts with foreigners,'' the newspaper noted.

Russia's lower house of Parliament has overwhelmingly approved restoring the former Soviet anthem as the Russian national anthem. The move had the strong support of Russian President Vladimir Putin who said use of the old anthem represented a gesture of reconciliation. Critics argued that the anthem is a throwback to the former totalitarian government. The anthem will have new words, eliminating verses that praised communist leaders Vladimir Lenin and Joseph Stalin. The lower house of Parliament also gave formal endorsement to Russia's white, red and blue flag but reinstated the old red and gold Soviet flag as the flag of the military.

Mexico's new President Vicente Fox received a thousand visitors today. They were retired elderly Mexicans who used to work for the government and they all wanted money. Not a lot mind you, just the 160-dollar bonus usually handed out when there is a new administration in Mexico City. Their visit reminded Fox, though, if he needed reminding that he is going to have to pay serious attention to Mexico's poor and the promises and proposals will no longer be enough. The World's Frank Contraris has the story from Mexico City. When Fox gave his oath a week ago before the Congress and the nation, he took an unusual step. Mexico's constitution stipulates the exact words the new President should have used, including a promise to protect the nation's prosperity. Fox changed the wordings slightly but with great significance. Fox raised his right hand and also promised to look after the needs of Mexico's poor and most marginalized people. After the oath Fox laid out his plan for creating small loans known as micro-credit for small businesses. He also said Mexico's government would no longer exchange social services for the poor people's votes. Creating wealth and jobs Fox said is the best way to fight poverty. Mexico has created the most jobs during the last six years in Maquiladoras or assembly plans. Located in the Tijuana right near the economic Goliath California, this Maquiladoras makes thousands of intricate electronic parts every month. Quality control specialist Marti Nokhosa originally came to Tijuana 28 years ago from the rural state of Zacatecas. She could find no work there. Now she earns about 80 dollars a week, an amount she says satisfies her needs and prevents her from crossing into the US illegally in search of better paying work. We are happy here. We only earn a little but we are happy in our own country, not like Mexicans who go to the US and face discrimination or are given the worst jobs. We are fine here in our dear Mexico. Mexico's northern factories are so productive, people from the poor rural areas to the south are coming here hoping to earn a wage that will lift them from poverty. By stark contrast poverty has grown in the last six years in Mexico's once highly productive agricultural lands. Mexico now imports more corn than it produces, which is bad news for 80-year-old Francisco Amakita. He owns a small five-acre farm in rural Sinalow estate, once Mexico's leading corn producer. In a good year Amakita produces just enough to pay his bills. The biggest problem facing the new government, he says, is to help the poor people of these ranches and farms. The government has helped the rich farmers, says Amakita, but it gives no attention to the poorest ones like him. His only helper is his son Antonio who will return to the US soon for he earns 10 times more then he can make on his family's farm. President Fox hopes his plan to grow Mexico's economy each year will prevent people like the Amakitas from seeking work in the US. Economist Julio Bolvitnik served as an economic advisor to Fox. Of Mexico's 70 million poor people Bultwitnik says Fox's plan can help 28 million of them, and that's a good start, but he says, the new President must also do something about the low wages Mexicans earn. He agrees that the wages are lower than they have to be in order to be competitive. So, I think, we should stop that in all countries together, otherwise poverty will grow and grow and grow, and so what is the promise for these people? Fox, however, has flaunted Mexico's low wages in front of foreign investors saying they make Mexico more competitive in the world market. Bultwitnik and other economists say Fox must address this issue if he truly aims to eradicate 30% of poverty during his administration as he has promised. For The World, this is Frank Contraris in Mexico City.

International Aid agencies have warned that proposed United Nations sanctions against Afghanistan's Taliban authorities could paralyze efforts to provide humanitarian assistance to the victims of drought and conflict. The new sanctions proposed by the United States and Russia would impose an arms embargo on the Taliban. Among other things, they would also freeze Taliban assets abroad and restrict foreign travel by Taliban officials. The UN co-ordinator for Afghanistan said in Geneva, the proposed UN measure could block badly-needed aid shipments. I'm Connie Lawn, VOA News.

International aid agencies are warning that the proposed United Nations sanctions against the Taliban rulers of Afghanistan will paralyze humanitarian assistance to millions of drought and conflict stricken victims in Afghanistan. Lisa Schline in Geneva reports donor nations and aid agencies have just concluded a two-day meeting focussed on humanitarian assistance for Afghanistan. The so called Afghanistan support group says, it will take its concerns to the UN Security Council, which is debating new sanctions against the Taliban. The United Nations created the group in 1996 to coordinate international aid for Afghanistan. It is composed of 16 donor countries and international aid agencies. The UN coordinator for Afghanistan, Eric Demule says the Security Council is considering imposing an arms embargo against the Taliban, but not against the opposition Northern alliance. He says, the Taliban will see this as a one-sided resolution. As a result, when sanctions are imposed, the possibilities are there that the Taliban authorities will react in a, possibly in about a violent way, which would then imperil or make it impossible, certainly more difficult, for the international community to continue its aid programs. As a result of it the Afghan population again will suffer more. Afghanistan is in the throes of its worst drought in 30 years. Millions of people depend upon international assistance for survival. The UN reports that malnutrition is rampant and that women and children are the chief victims. Mr. Demule says, if violence erupts, the United Nations and private aid agencies will be forced to remove their staffs from the country. If this happens, he says many humanitarian programs will come to an end at a time when the population is most vulnerable. Lisa Schline for VOA News, Geneva.

President Vladimir Putin of Russia said Saturday that he would accept the recommendation of his presidential pardon commission to set free Edmond Pope, the former naval intelligence officer sentenced last week to 20 years for alleged espionage. His release is expected as early as Thursday. In Putin's first public comments since a Moscow judge imposed the maximum sentence on Pope, an American, on Wednesday, the Russian leader said the recommendation for clemency was made by ``respected people'' and ``I cannot but heed their opinion.'' A 16-member clemency board made up of academics, writers and other well-known intellectuals voted unanimously on Friday to urge Putin to free Pope on humanitarian grounds. After his conviction following a seven-week closed trial here, Pope opted to seek a pardon instead of pressing an appeal of his conviction. ``My father is terminally ill and I wish to visit him one last time,'' Pope wrote to the presidential commission. Anatoly I. Pristavkin, a Soviet-era writer who is chairman of the commission, said on Russian television Friday night that the commission's recommendation showed ``that we are a magnanimous people, although legends circulate in the world about our cruelty.'' Other members of the commission suggested that ``spy mania'' had gone too far in the Pope case. Mark G. Rosovsky, a playwright and a theater director, said the case arose ``in an absolutely different historical context'' from the famous spy cases of the Cold War, ``and we today have to understand that the very concepts of espionage and spy mania have changed under contemporary conditions.'' A commission member, Marietta O. Chudakova, took the criticism one step further, saying, ``The investigative organs in our country still bear the marks of the Soviet system, more so than society in general.'' She said she hoped Putin would take that point. A Russian lawyer who was a member of Pope's legal team was briefly detained on Friday near the courthouse in Moscow where the trial occurred, driven across the city, and released near Leningradsky railway station, said Pavel Astakhov, Pope's lead lawyer. Astakhov said Pope's legal team was the object of surveillance and harassment during the case. The unexplained detention led to an immediate protest by the Moscow lawyers association. Putin's made his remarks Saturday while visiting Magnitogorsk, a huge metallurgical center in the Ural Mountains. He did not comment on the substance of the espionage charge against Pope, which involved his alleged receipt of secret information about the high-speed Shkval, or Squall, torpedo system. The system represented a breakthrough in underwater propulsion technology in the late 1970s. At the trial, Pope's lawyers argued that the information he received was available from open sources. Prosecutors, however, offered evidence that some of the information was classified, and raised the question of what kind of publicly available information required the transfer by Pope of $28,000 to the Russian scientist with whom he was dealing. Also arrested last April was Anatoly Babkin, the head of the rocket engine department at Bauman State Technical University. Babkin has since suffered two heart attacks and has yet to face criminal proceedings. Pope's lawyers have asserted that Babkin recanted his initial testimony that information provided to the American included secret material. However, other scientific witnesses also testified at the trial that some of the Shkval's secrets were compromised in the material prepared for sale to Pope and his associates at Pennsylvania State University. Putin said he had spoken with President Clinton about the case on Friday and had assured him that Pope would be offered any needed medical care from Russian doctors until the final decision was made on the pardon. Pope has suffered from a rare form of bone cancer. In Washington, Clinton said he was ``very appreciative'' of the decision to pardon Pope. He said the Russian move should also prove positive for long-term relations with Russia. Asked by reporters if there was any deal involved, Clinton said: There is no deal. We just had a discussion about it.'' Putin also said an important reason for his consideration of a pardon was not to allow the Pope case to lead to a worsening of Russian-American relations. After Pope's arrest, a number of members of Congress denounced his detention and warned Moscow that if he was not released on humanitarian grounds the case would poison relations with the next U.S. president and undermine the important agenda of arms control and international security questions pending between Washington and Moscow. By pardoning Pope, Putin will back his domestic counterintelligence service, which initiated the case against Pope and Babkin, while also advertising to the world that Russia remains a technological power that, though degraded, harbors a great deal of artful science _ especially in physics, optics, space and lasers _ that has marketable value. The delay in acting on the request for a pardon is a matter of Russian law, officials said, explaining that the verdict against Pope does not come into force until one week after it is handed down. At that time, Putin could grant the pardon, which means he will probably act on Thursday, when he is scheduled to be in Cuba. Pope's wife, Cheri, who kept a vigil in Moscow during the final arguments at the trial, expressed hope that she and her husband would be able to return to the United States in time for Christmas.

and finally tonight, to russia, with interest and curiosity. while we may have our own problems here with a roller coaster of an election, they've got some flip-flopping of their own going on when it comes to their national anthem. abc's richard gizbert reports. in a country that shed most symbols of its authoritarian past almost a decade ago, one of them is coming out of retirement -- the old soviet anthem. it was always a bold, stirring melody, a feature of the military parades in red square that westerners came to recognize through medal ceremonies at the olympic games. but, like most soviet symbols, it had to go. "we should bury it forever," this man says. "our citizens were massacred to the sound of that anthem, and we were deprived of our freedom." so boris yeltsin, who throughout his presidency displayed an interest in, if not a sophistication for, music, got rid of it. he replaced it with a century russian composition -- 7777 -- an instrumental with no lyrics to offend anyone. and that's part of the problem. russian athletes were uncomfortably mute when their new lyric-less anthem was played. some even complained that it hurt team morale. ordinary russians have difficulty humming the tune -- humming dissonantly -- not like the old anthem. 7777 humming melodically and boris yeltsin's successor, president vladimir putin was clearly not a fan. putin, a soviet-era kgb agent, wanted to revive the soviet anthem. he wants to present this idea of a strong state in symbols, in the flag, in the national anthem. but putin realized that the anthem's old pro-communist lyrics wouldn't resonate in the new russia. so this past week parliament approved putin's compromise proposal, bring the melody of the old anthem back and come up with some new words. agreeing on those new words will not be easy, in a country that often cannot escape or does not want to escape its soviet past. richard gizbert, abc news, london.

Ex-Communist and past president Ion Iliescu won Romania's presidential elections with 70 percent of the vote, exit polls showed Sunday. Ultranationalist Corneliu Vadim Tudor trailed with about 30 percent, the polls showed. The polls, conducted by the IMAS polling institute, were based on interviews with about 20,000 people questioned as they finished voting. Another poll by INSOMAR had similar results. Official results are not expected until Monday. Iliescu, a Soviet-educated engineer who was president from 1990 to 1996, was the favorite in the polls before Sunday's runoff. He has promised a measured reform of the economy to ensure a ``dignified'' entry into European institutions. To secure victory, he needed the support of centrist parties. These mainstream groups pledged to back the former communist functionary, fearing that Romania could become an international pariah if Tudor won. Tudor is known for his anti-Semitic and racist remarks, though he has recently sought to tone down his statements. He is also known for his poetry praising the late dictator Nicolae Ceausescu during his lifetime. Tudor has sought to portray himself as pro-European. ``I voted for Corneliu Vadim Tudor to get rid of the crooks,'' said Iosif Briscov, a 70-year-old pensioner in the Tranylvanian city of Cluj. ``We don't need NATO and the European Union. We need to be shut off until we wake up.'' Tudor was first in first-round voting in Transylvania.

Ex-Communist and past president Ion Iliescu won Romania's presidential elections with 70 percent of the vote, exit polls showed Sunday.

He is also known for his poetry praising the late dictator Nicolae Ceausescu during his lifetime. Tudor has sought to portray himself as pro-European. ``I voted for Corneliu Vadim Tudor to get rid of the crooks,'' said Iosif Briscov, a 70-year-old pensioner in the Tranylvanian city of Cluj. ``We don't need NATO and the European Union. We need to be shut off until we wake up.'' Tudor was first in first-round voting in Transylvania. By 5 p.m., some 38 percent of voters had cast their ballot, about six percent less than in the Nov. 26 general elections. Some 17.7 million voters were eligible to cast ballots for a new president. Polls opened at 7 a.m. and were to close at 9 p.m. The runoff was called after Iliescu failed to secure the 50 percent needed for outright victory in the first round. He won 36 percent in November to Tudor's 28 percent. Tudor attracts voters who are disenchanted with politicians, while Iliescu is supported by poor Romanians, rural voters and those who lived well under communism. Iliescu, 70, had been close to Ceausescu until the early 1970s, but later led the revolt to topple the dictator. ``I am confident that the future of Romania will be decided in the way it should be,'' said Iliescu as he cast his ballot. ``I urge people to vote for a better future.'' ``Today we will decide whether to continue the process of consolidating a law-abiding country and of rebuilding Romania or whether to block this process,'' he added. Though he espouses democracy, Iliescu has indicated he will not promote the rapid and painful economic reforms that Romania needs to improve its laggard economy and join the European Union. Claiming that he had been ``hunted like an animal'' by the Romanian media since the first round of voting, Tudor on Sunday accused Iliescu of planning to rig the elections. ``We will integrate into Europe but in our own specific way,'' he told a crowd of journalists and supporters. ``We won't be the day laborers and garbage collectors of Europe.'' ``Time is on my side,'' he claimed. ``From now on, in every Romanian child a little Vadim will be born.'' Tudor, 51, was a fringe politician until the late 1990s. Before last month's race, he surged in popularity after promising to root out corruption and promote the rule of law. His sudden rise has stunned Romanians and alarmed the county's elite, many of whom are lambasted as ``traitors'' in Tudor's weekly Greater Romania magazine. In a separate incident, an angry voter threw a bottle of blue ink in outgoing President Emil Constantinescu's face as he voted in the same polling station as Iliescu. He got the ink into his eyes but he was not injured. Constantinescu was whisked away in his car and the man was immobilized by Constantinescu's security officers. The assailant is a member of the Greater Romania party from the southwestern city of Timisoara. Lab tests showed the substance was not toxic.

South Korea's President Kim Dae-jung, a former political prisoner who received the Nobel Peace Prize on Sunday, promised to devote the rest of his life to peace, democracy and reconciliation with North Korea. The 76-year-old leader survived prison, exile, attempts on his life and six months on death row in more than 40 years as a pro-democracy activist and political opposition figure under military-backed rule in the South. ``Often, I shuddered with the fear of death,'' Kim said in his acceptance speech. ``I shall give the rest of my life to human rights and peace in my country and the world.'' Kim was awarded the coveted prize for his lifetime of work for democracy and human rights, and for his efforts to reconcile the two Koreas, which have been uneasy neighbors since the 1950-53 Korean War. That included a summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Il in June. ``Kim Dae-jung has had the will to break with 50 years of hostility and to reach out a cooperative hand across what has probably been the world's most heavily guarded frontier,'' Gunnar Berge, the chairman of the five-member awards committee, said at the ceremony. Since the historic meeting in Pyongyang, the capitalist South and communist North have embarked on a series of friendly gestures, including two reunions of separated relatives, the reopening of liaison offices and an agreement to reconnect a cross-border railway. Kim received his Nobel gold medal and diploma at a solemn ceremony, attended by about 1,000 people including Norway's King Harald V. The prize also includes a cash award of about $940,000. In his acceptance speech, Kim _ speaking Korean _ said the award was for all Korean pro-democracy activists. Earlier, he said he would liked to have shared the prize with North Korea's leader. Though much progress has been made, combat-ready armies, including 37,000 U.S. troops in the South, remain in place on both sides of the world's most heavily armed border. The two sides have yet to discuss arms reductions and troop pullbacks, sensitive topics that could take years to resolve. The peace prize is awarded in Oslo, while the other Nobels are presented in Stockholm, Sweden. The prize for literature went to Gao Xingjian, an exiled Chinese-born author whose writings reflect the struggle for individuality in the face of China's cultural revolution. The first Chinese writer to win the award, Gao, 60, fled China in 1987 after one of his plays was banned, and is now a French citizen. American Jack Kilby won half the physics prize for inventing the fingernail-sized integrated circuit, a forerunner of the microchip, while Russian Zhores Alferov and German-born U.S. citizen Herbert Kroemer shared the other half for work contributing to satellite and cellular phone technology. The prize for economics went to Americans James J. Heckman and Daniel L. McFadden for research about lifestyle habits that has contributed to employment training, public transportation and communication. Swede Arvid Carlsson and Americans Paul Greengard and Eric Kandel won the medicine prize for work that could lead to new treatments for schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease, addiction and other disorders. Hideki Shirakawa of Japan and Americans Alan J. Heeger and Alan G. MacDiarmid won the chemistry prize for discovering that plastic can be made electrically conductive _ an advance that led to improvements in film, TV screens and windows. ___ On the Net: http://www.nobel.se

Justice Minister Hikmet Sami Turk said Sunday that Turkey's inmates eventually will be moved from dormitory-style open wards to small cells, despite a 52-day-old hunger strike by hundreds of inmates. The inmates say they will maintain their so-called ``death fast'' until transfer is scrapped or the government agrees to move them only to smaller wards instead of cells. Human rights groups say torture occurs in Turkey's prisons and prisoners fear they will be more vulnerable to abuse by authorities in cells. Authorities argue that outlawed political groups run their overcrowded wards as indoctrination centers, and hope to quell their political activities by dividing them among small cells. Turkish officials say the open wards contribute to frequent riots and hostage-takings. At least three of the fasting inmates are now in critical condition. More than 100 of the inmates have consumed only water since Nov. 19, although many of the protesters started the fast with sugared and salted water. Relatives say some have now lost their eyesight, while others are too weak to walk and are suffering from kidney problems. Turk said Sunday that eventually abolishing the ward system was a ``must.'' ``If Turkey maintains the ward system, problems in prisons will live forever,'' Turk said in Ankara. ``This system will absolutely be ended.'' A mediator said the inmates were determined to continue the hunger strike. ``They say they may accept 15-to-20-people wards instead of cells. Unless this is met, they say they will not end the 'death strikes,' '' Oral Calislar, a journalist who met with the inmates Saturday, told a news conference in Istanbul. About 5,000 opponents of the new cell-system demonstrated peacefully Sunday in the southern city of Adana, private NTV television said. Most were relatives of inmates and human rights activists. The Council of Europe's committee for the prevention of torture arrived in Turkey on Sunday, accepting a government invitation to evaluate the conditions in new prison system. Turk said Saturday that the new prisons would not be opened until a consensus is reached and the system is reviewed according to international standards. Some of the hunger-strikers could also be granted amnesty, which President Ahmet Necdet Sezer is now considering. The bill, approved by parliament Friday, would free half of Turkey's 72,000 prisoners.

Japan's government has determined that ousted Peruvian president Alberto Fujimori holds Japanese citizenship, an official said Monday, a development that could allow him to stay in the country as long as he wants. A government investigation found that Fujimori was born in Peru but registered by his parents at a local Japanese consulate, making him a Japanese citizen, a Foreign Ministry official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. Fujimori has not revoked his Japanese citizenship, said the official, who works in the ministry's Latin American division. He added that under Peruvian law, Fujimori also holds Peruvian citizenship since he was born in that country. Javier Valle Riestra, a constitutional expert and former Peruvian prime minister, said his country's constitution requires only that a president be born in Peru and contains no explicit prohibition against duel citizenship. Fujimori cannot be extradited if he is declared to have Japanese citizenship, since Japan's extradition law does not permit deportation of its nationals. It would have been difficult in any case, since Japan and Peru have no extradition treaty. Japan's determination that Fujimori, the son of Japanese immigrants to Peru, was born in the Andean nation could put to rest persistent rumors to the contrary that would have meant his presidency had been illegitimate. Hiromi Jitsukawa, an official from Japan's Justice Ministry, said the government would officially reveal its findings ``within a matter of days.'' Fujimori has been in Japan since mid-November, when a bribery scandal surrounding his former spy chief threatened his rule. The Peruvian congress deposed him in his absence, declaring him unfit for office. Peruvian authorities are investigating Fujimori's connections with his one-time spymaster, Vladimiro Montesinos, who is accused of controlled a web of money laundering, drug trafficking and influence peddling. The former president could face charges if he returns to Peru. Fujimori denies any wrongdoing. Kumamoto, where Fujimori's family records are reportedly kept, is on the island of Kyushu, 565 miles southwest of the capital.

In the slanting northern sunlight of December, it is difficult to shake the impression that the answer to one of the most enduring mysteries of science and culture is waiting to be discovered here somewhere, casting its long shadow on the cobblestones and quays. That mystery is not the nature of existence or the ultimate fates of humanity and the cosmos, although it does have at least something to do with why scientists and artists pursue those questions so doggedly. Rather, it is the seemingly immutable prestige, influence and high-voltage dazzle of the Nobel Prizes. King Carl Gustaf of Sweden awarded most of this year's prizes, handing out the awards for physics, chemistry, physiology or medicine, economics and literature here on Sunday evening at a white-tie ceremony in the Stockholm Concert Hall. South Korea's president, Kim Dae-jung, received this year's Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo on the same day. The Nobel prizes were first awarded in 1901. The reason for their staying power could be as simple as the one given by Jack S. Kilby, the taciturn engineer for Texas Instruments who received a share of the physics prize for having built the first integrated circuit in 1958 in Texas. ``They've done this 99 times,'' Kilby said gruffly at a splendid reception given last Thursday by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, which actually chooses the winners in physics, chemistry and economics. ``It should've boiled down to a system and it has. A very good one.'' True. But others have pointed out that the prizes were created by the will of the Swedish-born inventor of dynamite, Alfred Nobel, in a time when scientific research had a radically different face than it does today _ before giant collaborations like the human genome project and billion-dollar particle physics experiments, before the explosion of competing research groups in areas like biomedicine and microelectronics, before disciplines like the behavioral sciences and quantum computing even existed. How can this seeming anachronism still command the world's attention, captivate the imagination of the most utilitarian scientists and technologists and cause vast shifts of research funding as officials scramble to follow the Nobel committees' lead? (At a press conference before the reception, Dr. Zhores I. Alferov, the Russian who also took a share of the physics prize and has the unmistakable air of an international star in the making, told everyone how bored he was by constant questions about the sagging fortunes of science in his country since the collapse of the Soviet Union. He claimed that recently, ``the budget was increased 10 percent, mostly due to Nobel Prize.'') Irrationally romantic as it sounds, some of the answers do become clearer by walking the streets and corridors of this city, where closer inspection reveals the depth of the tradition the Nobels have engendered both in Sweden's academic system and in the society at large. The job of sifting and reporting on hundreds of Nobel nominations received each year is approached by scientists here as a solemn charge whose success or failure reflects on their home institutions and their country, and whose ultimate and entirely uncynical goal is to make the world a better place for humanity. Backing their judgments with the cultural horsepower generated by a century of tradition, the various committees, academies and universities involved are able _ like almost no other institution _ to speak with authority to nearly all strata of international society, from intellectuals and scientists to the ordinary citizens of South Korea who clustered around televisions and thrilled to the news that their president had won the Peace Prize. Nobel officials are acutely aware of the criticism and controversy that some of their choices have generated, as well as the more common approbation. ``I think you approach this with great humility,'' said Erling Norrby, secretary-general of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. ``As you go along, you see the reaction of the world, and you say, `Well, we had a good verdict this year.''' Norrby, like other Nobel officials, peppers visitors with questions about controversial elements of the prizes, for example the custom of awarding the science Nobels to no more than three people in an era when decentralized collaborations are becoming the rule in some disciplines. Officials also appear to be still sorting out the mixed reaction to this year's physics prize, which remains the bedrock of the Nobel institution and is always delivered first by the king. Eschewing the kind of fundamental research usually honored by the physics Nobels, the prize focused on mostly technological breakthroughs that made possible things like personal computers and the tiny solid-state lasers at the heart of compact disc players and bar code readers. The chemistry prize also focused on electronics advances. Anders Barany, the secretary of the five-person committee that recommends winners in physics to the full academy, pointed out that historical precedents could be found even for the highly applied nature of this year's award. In 1912, for example, Nils Dalen, a Swedish engineer, won for an invention that improved the regulation of lighting in lighthouses and buoys. Barany, in a wry but circumspect observation that may or may not have been a hint about this year's deliberations, said that much more fundamental advances had initially been considered. ``There was a meeting,'' he said, ``and the door was closed. And when the door was opened, it was Dalen.'' To anchor its tradition even deeper, the academy is expanding its collection of historical records and scientific instruments related to the Nobel Prizes in a wing of its main building, said Karl Grandin, assistant director of the academy's Center for the History of Science. Flipping through a huge bound volume there, Dr. Grandin opened to the original, typed report that led to Albert Einstein's 1921 Nobel Prize. The academy considers the volumes ``their treasure,'' he said, and they become available to selected historians only 50 years after a prize is awarded. The Nobel Foundation, which awards the prize money (a little under $1 million per prize this year), is also mulling the nature of creativity itself with a pair of identical exhibits on the Nobel Prizes. One exhibit will open in Stockholm next spring and remain there, while the other will travel the world. (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.) The exhibit, which will combine Nobel artifacts, explanatory films, works of art and multimedia excursions into Nobel history, will explore a central question raised by the modern era of collaborative science: what is the relation between the milieu and the individual in stimulating creative work? Explorations into places that have exploded with creative work at various points of history will help illuminate the question, but Svante Lindqvist, the director of the museum that will contain the exhibit, cautions that the goal is not to settle matters definitively. ``We don't provide answers,'' Lindqvist said. ``We want the visitor to come out confused at a higher level.'' (END OPTIONAL TRIM.) The exhibit could stoke the intense level of interest in the Nobels in Swedish society. The awards ceremony alone usually rates more than six hours of uninterrupted television coverage, said Thomas von Heijne of Swedish television. Thomas Ostros, who heads the Swedish ministry of education and science and who turned up at one of the week's gatherings, said that the Nobel Prizes are ``very tightly connected to Sweden's self-perception,'' adding, ``It's one of the strongest Swedish trademarks that exists.'' For all the wider manifestations of their influence, however, the Nobel Prizes still retain their formidable stature most of all because the committees have chosen a long succession of gloriously talented scientists, writers and peacemakers. Especially in the sciences, the continuity of the prizes is emphasized when the work of one laureate builds upon that of an earlier laureate, creating ``a sort of apostolic succession,'' said Michael Sohlman, executive director of the Nobel Foundation. But just as with every other aspect of the Nobels, a deeper sense of that succession can be found in the byways of Stockholm. As flashbulbs went off during the press conference and the physics and chemistry winners wrapped themselves in the mantle of quantum mechanics, the once-revolutionary science that underlies all their discoveries, a small, almost elfin woman named Ruth Braunziger stood smiling on the edge of the melee of cameras and reporters. She is the daughter of Erwin Schroedinger, the German physicist who won a Nobel Prize in 1933 for firing one of the loudest of all shots in that revolution, creating an equation that describes how matter can behave as both a particle and a wave. Braunziger, who lives in a house in Austria that she said was partly paid for with her father's prize money, suggested that the Nobel tradition created something more than a succession of ideas. ``Lately I've been meeting a lot of people who have joined the family,'' she said, looking at this year's laureates.

In Yugoslavia today, a Belgrade court indited six-members of electoral commissions on charges that they abused their official functions. Last September, Yugoslavia's Federal Election Commission published results of a presidential vote, results which, if anyone had believed them, would have necessitated a run off between Slobodan Milosevic and Voislav Kostunica. There was no run off, of course, Serbs wouldn't stand for it. Now three months later Kostunica is no longer opposing the government. He is running it. The World's Jackie Rolan reports from Belgrade. The popular uprising which swept Voislav Kostunica to power, hundreds of thousands of people took to the streets in early October to force Slobodan Milosevic to accept his election defeat and step down. In the two months since then the United Nations and western governments have rushed to welcome Yugoslavia back into the international fold. But at home the most noticeable change has been a sharp increase in the cost of living. President Kostunica says this is inevitable but he sees better times ahead. We are living all under very difficult conditions, social aspirations is very difficult and that is something which has to do with Milosevic regime, sanctions of international community, bombing of this country last year, but what people mostly appreciate is that sense of freedom. The west has been rewarding the democratic reforms in Serbia with big aid packages, but the money comes with some conditions attached. Western governments want Serbia to cooperate with the international war crimes Tribunal in The Hague. The Tribunal has been allowed to open an office in Belgrade, but it's not clear how far this cooperation will go. President Kostunica says he does not agree with demands that Milosevic should be extradited to The Hague. I am not in favor of that I must say. I am in favor of trying to go through these processes of responsibility within the country. I have a very general and many very general objections to The Hague Tribunal. I cannot imagine that just one judicial instant, just one court is actually enough to cope this problems. After winning the presidency in September, Kostunica and his allies now face a much easier task with Serbian Parliamentary elections in less then two weeks time. The latest opinion polls suggest they will get about 65% of the vote, while Milosevic and his party would be lucky to win more then a few seats. The opposition coalition has been an alliance of convenience and President Kostunica admits that it will not last long beyond the elections. We had to run through these republic elections and with all these differences we are staying till these elections, and later on when we come to some elections, of course, quite normally and for the good of democracy, these differences between the parties within democratic opposition of Serbia will appear. The splits are already visible with public disagreements between Kostunica and Zoran Djindjic, the man expected to form the new Serbian government. So the country faces more political instability in the year ahead and the likely prospect of new elections. For The World, I am Jacky Rowland in Belgrade.

In the end, Pele was king, national pride was saved, and Brazilian fans were placated _ sort of. After a survey to choose the century's best soccer player surprisingly named Argentina's Diego Maradona instead of Pele, the sport's ruling body found a diplomatic solution: It awarded two prizes. Maradona, who won two Italian league titles with Napoli and led Argentina to the 1986 World Cup, won an Internet poll. He polled 54 percent of the online vote, followed by Pele at 19 percent. FIFA came up with a ``football family'' award for Pele, a three-time World Cup winner and the sport's career leading scorer. Pele took 73 percent of the ballots cast through internal FIFA balloting, with Maradona third at 6 percent behind fellow Argentine Alfredo Di Stefano with 10 percent. In Brazil, the FIFA balloting passed almost unnoticed until the voting ended Nov. 20. ``To choose the best in the world by keyboard is a joke,'' said Mario Zagallo, who played with Pele on Brazil's World Cup champion teams in 1958 and 1962 and coached him on a third in 1970. ``But those who really understand soccer gave the prize to Pele.''

Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday pardoned an American businessman who had been sentenced to 20 years in prison on espionage charges, clearing the way for him to go home, the Kremlin said. Edmond Pope of State College, Pa., was released immediately from Moscow's Lefortovo prison, said an official speaking on condition of anonymity. Associated Press reporters saw two cars escorted by police speeding away from the prison where Pope had been held for more than eight months. The cars headed straight to Moscow's main international airport and a plane carrying Pope took off for Frankfurt, Germany, shortly before noon, said Pope's lawyer, Pavel Astakhov. ``It's like waking up from a horrible nightmare,'' Pope's mother, Elizabeth Pope, told AP from her home in Grants Pass, Ore. ``I will be much happier when I see him and I am able to put my arms around him.'' A presidential spokesman told AP that Putin pardoned Pope on humanitarian grounds and in order to preserve good relations with Washington. The pardon cited ``the health condition of the convict and his personal appeal, and also ... the high level of ties between the Russian Federation and the United States of America.'' Pope has suffered in the past from a rare form of bone cancer, and his family feared that it may have returned during his imprisonment. His wife, Cheri, has said he had lost about 25 pounds and two teeth, probably due to the poor prison diet. But Russia's Security Service, the agency that prosecuted Pope, said a prison doctor examined him before his release and pronounced his health ``normal.'' Elizabeth Pope said her son and his wife would be getting a medical evaluation in Frankfurt. However, Astakhov said the Popes would travel immediately to the United States from there. Pope's imprisonment and conviction by a Moscow court last week on charges of obtaining plans for a top-secret Russian Navy torpedo prompted a diplomatic confrontation between Washington and Moscow. The U.S. government criticized the court that convicted Pope, with observers saying it was heavily biased in favor of the Russian security services. It was the first time in 40 years that an American had been convicted of espionage in Russia. The case has raised questions about the growing power of the security services in Russia and fueled fears among foreigners trying to do business there. Pope has protested his innocence, saying the plans he purchased were not secret and that the technology had already been sold abroad and published in open sources. Pope sent a letter to Putin asking for clemency on the eve of his conviction, his wife said. Putin, who is on a visit to Cuba, had indicated last week that he would release Pope. Thursday was the first day that Putin could pardon Pope under Russian law. ``It is impossible to overestimate this act of mercy,'' Astakhov told the Interfax news agency. ``Freedom is the only thing that Pope needs at this moment,'' he said, though he expressed frustration that Pope was convicted in the first place. Pope's wife went to the prison early Thursday along with U.S. Embassy officers. A clutch of reporters and TV crews waited at the gates of the high-security prison, which is surrounded by a cinderblock wall topped with coiled, barbed wire. The Security Service said Pope was handed his personal belongings and given the chance to ask questions about the pardon. He had none, the service said. Back in the United States, Pope's partner in CERF Technologies, which specializes in studying foreign maritime equipment, called news of the release ``wonderful.'' ``I think we're very fortunate that President Putin has taken the action that he has, because Edmond's physical condition has so obviously deteriorated and we all fear for his life,'' Charles Mong said. ``I just hope that he's able to get home and get to a good facility and get checked out and be able to resume his life.''

Edmond Pope, an American businessman and retired naval intelligence officer who had been convicted of espionage by a Russian court and sentenced to 20 years in prison, was pardoned Thursday by President Vladimir Putin and was immediately flown out of Russia. Putin said in his decree that he had granted the pardon because of Pope's health problems and because he wanted to preserve good relations with the United States. Pope, 54, left Russia on a small chartered plane less than three hours after a prison warden read him the decision, ending his eight months of imprisonment. The businessman, who was noticeably thinner and dressed in a brown jacket and sweater, was shown on Russian television with a faint smile as received the news. Pope, who suffers from a rare form of bone cancer, flew to Germany, where he was examined at Landstuhl Regional Medical Center. From there he and his wife, Cheri, planned to continue to Grants Pass, Ore., where his mother, Elizabeth Pope, is caring for his ailing father. ``I have mixed feelings,'' Pope said just after his release in comments that were broadcast on television and translated into Russian. ``I'm glad, but at the same time I'm sad that I may have caused harm to the relations between our countries.'' The Clinton administration, which earlier had condemned the Russian court's decision, applauded Putin for granting the pardon. In a written statement, Clinton called Pope's imprisonment unjustified. It appeared from the manner in which the pardon was delivered _ by authorities in Moscow _ that Russia did not want Putin to announce Pope's release while in Cuba, where he flew on Wednesday night for a three-day official visit. They were apparently hesitant to see the Russian president reaching out to the United States while meeting with an old Cold War ally, Fidel Castro. Pope, who had worked in part on projects related to the development of naval weapons at the Pennsylvania State University Applied Research Laboratory, was arrested in April for what Russian prosecutors said was spying. Pope, who owns TechSource Marine Industries in State College, Pa., and an associate were purchasing technical reports about a special rocket-propelled torpedo from Prof. Anatoly Babkin, the head of the rocket-engine department of Bauman State Technical University in Moscow. Pope had argued that the contract he signed with Babkin stipulated that the reports would not contain any secret information. Pope's lawyer indicated Thursday in a telephone interview that the report might have included some classified information, but that Pope was not guilty of any crime because he was not aware he was receiving classified material. In the market free-for-all that ensued after the fall of the Soviet Union, the definition of secret information blurred as laws changed, impoverished scientists began seeking new sources of income and the government tried to redefine the West. That was complicated by layoffs in the American military, especially of highly trained officers with expertise overseas. Many of these people came to the countries they had studied with business projects, according to E. Wayne Merry, senior associate at the American Foreign Policy Council, in a letter he posted to a Russia-oriented news list on the Internet. After arriving in Germany Thursday, Pope, dressed in a hospital gown, waved a small American flag from a balcony overlooking a throng of reporters and television cameras. According to Russian television reports Thursday night from Germany, doctors said they expected that Pope would soon be ready to continue his flight to the United States. Clearly, the months of imprisonment took its toll on Pope, who lost two teeth and about 25 pounds, news agencies quoted his wife as saying. Later in his confinement, he was moved to a six-bunk cell from a room for two prisoners. His lawyer said his roommates were heavy smokers and on occasion pilfered his food and once even took his medicine. Pope's case has been a source contention between Russia and the United States, which is still trying to define relations with Putin, who was relatively unknown when he won Russia's presidential election in March. The pardon also coincided with George W. Bush's victory in the American presidential election, and some here said Putin's action would strike a positive note for future relations. ``This is a present for the new president,'' said Vladimir Lukin, a former Russian ambassador to the United States who now serves in the Russian parliament. ``I don't know whether Pope is a spy. I don't know the documents. But to pardon Pope in the current circumstances is a gesture in the right direction.'' In Moscow Thursday, the mood was unsympathetic, occasionally verging on hostile. In one call-in radio show, each question was more skeptical than the next. A woman from Moscow asked why Pope had traveled all the way to Russia on business if he was ill, while a young man said he did not think the issue even warranted a call-in show. But this did not dampen Pope's mood. Above all, he was just glad to be going home. Joking with a Russian television journalist after receiving his pardon, he dismissed a comparison to a movie-star spy. ``I'm no James Bond,'' he said, laughing. ``I'm just a retired naval officer.''

Pope is the American businessman who was convicted last week on spying charges and sentenced to 20 years in a Russian prison. He denied any wrongdoing. Russian President Vladimir Putin pardoned him for health reasons. Pope was flown to the U.S. military base at Ramstein, Germany. He will spend the next several days at the medical center there before he returns home with his wife Sherry. Pope was in remission from a rare form of bone cancer when he was arrested in Russia. Doctors will examine him for signs that the cancer may have come back while he awaiting trial in a Russian jail. A spokeswoman said that Pope was suffering from malnutrition and high blood pressure.

The World's Moscow correspondent Nenad Sebek is right here in Boston. Nenad, today Vladimir Putin sent a message of congratulations to President-elect Bush. How about a reality check from you, is the Russian President likely, sincerely happy about the outcome of the election? Well, it is very difficulty to say what Putin is thinking, what he has come up with is a classic sort of diplomatic note of saying "well, congratulations on your elections and we hope we'll work well". But its a Russian tradition that they sort of never openly comment on who the next President is going to be, what the policy issues are going to be, what the issues are going to be. This is just sort of a note saying "well, congratulations lets hope we'll work well." Okay so that is in a public declaration. I know that you have spoken privately and in some cases during interviews with lots of people, decision-makers throughout Moscow, what are they telling you? Well, there seemed to have been a preference for a Republican President all along, in Moscow. There is somehow a feeling that the Republicans are the party that Moscow has on a traditional basis dealt better with. Can you explain that, I mean, what is that preference for Republicans? Well, if you look back at history, most of the major arms deals and most of the major deals between Moscow and Washington were done whilst there was a Republican President sitting in the White House, not when there was a Democrat. How about one of the major issues that could separate the two countries and at this point there are two different ideologies on it already and that's national missile defense, which President-elect Bush has supported. He has supported it, but the Russians are hoping that that was pretty much pre-election rhetoric and that once he actually steps into the office he is not going to insist on it that much. They also have a feeling that the Republicans are a more pragmatic party and therefore are more likely to sort of reach some kind of an agreement and then there is one more thing they feel that the Republicans are more isolationist, which means that Washington is not going to go around trying to resolve every single trouble spot everywhere in the world and thereby stepping on Russia's toes, for example like during their strikes against Yugoslavia or during the war in Chechnya. They have a feeling that Washington is going to be more concerned with US affairs inside the United States and not that much with what's going on elsewhere in the world and thereby they feel they will have a greater playing field for themselves. One of the areas of tension, most recently, between the United States and Russia has been the issue on an American businessman, Edmund Pope, whom President Putin has pardoned today. This is a man who had been sentenced last week to 20 years in jail on espionage charges. Now as we speak, Mr. Pope is on his way back home here to the United States, should we interpret the pardon as a goodwill gesture to the President-elect, how do you read it? It's a goodwill gesture towards the new administration not necessarily towards George W Bush, it would have been the same. Pope would have pardoned even if Al Gore was the President-elect. Basically, Moscow was fed up with the whole affair. They got what they wanted. They got a sentence and President Putin was trying to get rid of Edmund Pope as soon as possible. We saw that because last Thursday he was sentenced, the next day he appealed to President Putin for clemency and immediately President Putin started the whole process in motion, so although Pope was officially free today we knew about this seven days ago. So it is a sign of, you know, lets do business guys. And other areas of business first in the agenda for President-elect Bush regarding Russia? Well, there is the issue of the national missile defense. That is certainly one thing to be discussed. Then what about the peacekeeping operations elsewhere in the world, primarily in the former Yugoslavia, where Russia wants a stronger role for itself than it had so far, and very important for Moscow is the issue of NATO expansion. They have a feeling that George Bush might not be as President, as keen on NATO expansion as the Clinton administration was or as a Gore administration would have been. The World's Nenad Sebek speaking to us from Boston, nice to have you here. Thank you very much, Lisa.

An intense manhunt was underway on Thursday for seven armed men who escaped from a maximum security prison near here on Wednesday by impersonating a civilian maintenance crew and overpowering their guards. Hundreds of law enforcement officials, some on horseback, used roadblocks, helicopters and tracking dogs to comb the rural countryside surrounding the John B. Connally Jr. state prison, three miles south of this ranching community of about 4,000 people. Six of the men, including two convicted murderers, were serving long prison sentences, Texas officials said. Particularly alarming, they said, was that the inmates had stolen weapons from prison guards during the daylight escape. ``They are now heavily armed and probably desperate,'' said Maj. William Daniels, a spokesman for the Texas Department of Criminal Justice. ``They've got nothing to lose, and these are seven really bad guys.'' Roadblocks were set up on every highway leading out of Kenedy, about 50 miles south of San Antonio, and prison guards searched on foot in cattle pastures up to 20 miles away. Daniels said the prison break began about 1:30 p.m. Wednesday when the seven men seized eight maintenance workers and two guards, stole their clothes, a radio and keys to a prison truck and left the prison employees tied up and locked in a utility room. Making their way to a rear gate of the prison, the men convinced a guard that they were authorized to perform work on a watchtower. After he opened the first of two gates leading from the prison, they overpowered the guard and left him bound with duct tape. Next, the men gained access to a watchtower by tricking another guard into believing they were supposed to install equipment. Both guards were left bound and unharmed, Daniels said. The seven stole 14 .357 Magnum pistols, an AR-15 semiautomatic rifle, a 12-gauge shotgun and several hundred rounds of ammunition from the watchtower, he said. They then fled in a prison pickup truck. The truck was found about 4 p.m. Wednesday, abandoned in a Wal-Mart parking lot in Kenedy. State and local law enforcement officials searched houses and apartments nearby, Daniels said. ``We think it's a distinct possibility that they were met by someone at the Wal-Mart. This whole thing was very well planned,'' he said. The escapees have been identified by the Texas authorities as Joseph C. Garcia, serving a 50-year sentence for murder; Randy Ethan Halprin, serving 30 years for injury to a child; Larry James Harper, sentenced to 50 years for aggravated assault and sexual assault; Patrick Henry Murphy Jr., serving 50 years for aggravated assault with a deadly weapon; Donald Keith Newbury, serving a life sentence for aggravated robbery with a deadly weapon; George Rivas, serving 5 years for burglary and kidnapping, and Michael Anthony Rodriguez, serving a life sentence for capital murder. This is the first escape from the five-year-old Connally prison, officials said. But the prison, which holds about 2,800 men, has not been without problems. In April, eight prisoners assaulted three guards, and on June 7 an inmate severely beat a warden as she searched a cell. Several days later, another corrections officer was stabbed by an inmate using a homemade knife.

The pilots involved in the fiery Oct. 31 crash of a Singapore Airlines plane may be detained longer in Taiwan, a prosecutor said Friday. The three pilots were expected to be freed Friday. But their release might be delayed because additional paperwork is needed before they can return to Singapore, prosecutor Song Keo-yeh said. The pilots have been detained in Taiwan since their Boeing 747-400 jumbo jet mistakenly tried to take off on a closed runway during a severe storm. The plane slammed into construction equipment and burst into flames, killing 83 people. Crash investigators have not formally concluded that pilot error caused the accident. Pilot unions have criticized the Taiwanese prosecutors, who are conducting their own crash investigation, for holding the pilots so long. Taiwan's Aviation Safety Council, which is conducting a separate crash investigation, has also urged the prosecutors to let the pilots return to their families. The three pilots are flight commander Capt. Foong Chee Kong, 41, a Malaysian; and Singaporean co-pilots Latif Cyrano, 36, and Ng Kheng Leng, 38. Last week, Song said they would be allowed to go home as long as Singapore agreed to return the men to Taiwan if they were needed by prosecutors investigating the crash. But on Friday, Song said a Taiwanese court decided that the airline should also be responsible for helping to return the pilots to Taiwan if necessary. Prosecutors were waiting for documents that would ensure the airline would cooperate. ``We believe the airline will have more restraint on the pilots,'' Song said. A Taipei-based Singapore Airlines official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said it was not immediately known when the requested paperwork would be completed. On Thursday night, Singapore Airlines held a simulation of Flight SQ006. At the request of prosecutors, the airline flew in a cargo plane similar to the airliner that crashed. The aircraft retraced the path of the jumbo jet. Song said the three pilots involved in the accident did not take part in the simulation.

LANDSTUHL, Germany (AP) _ U.S. businessman Edmond Pope, fresh from being pardoned by Russia for a spying conviction he denies, was in good spirits Friday after a restful first night in freedom at a German hospital, a spokeswoman said. Pope, 54, arrived at the U.S. military's Landstuhl Medical Center within hours after Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered him released Thursday. He immediately underwent medical tests and counseling, seeing a specialist for internal medicine and a psychologist _ and then had a good night's sleep, hospital spokeswoman Marie Shaw said. ``He rested very well. He is in good spirits,'' she said. ``And he's had a good breakfast.'' Pope had been sentenced to 20 years in jail last week, the first alleged U.S. spy convicted by Russia in four decades, but Putin pardoned him to help relations with the United States. Pope looked tired when he arrived in Germany after 253 days in Moscow's high-security Lefortovo prison. The release came soon after George W. Bush accepted victory in the U.S. presidential election, and some Russian experts speculated the move was made in hopes of garnering the president-elect's favor. Thursday was the first day Putin could have released Pope under Russian law. A presidential pardons commission had recommended the move following Pope's conviction. A Putin spokesman told The Associated Press that the Russian leader pardoned Pope on humanitarian grounds and to preserve good relations with Washington. President Clinton welcomed the release. Pope, who has suffered in the past from a rare form of bone cancer and whose health deteriorated while in prison, was to undergo a complete medical examination at Landstuhl, about 85 miles southwest of Frankfurt. Doctors said he might spend 24 to 36 hours in Germany before returning to Oregon, where his parents live. One of Pope's first wishes Thursday was for a cup of black coffee. Hospital officials said he appeared healthy and not malnourished. Pope has rejected Russian charges that he illegally obtained plans for a top-secret Russian Navy torpedo, saying what he purchased was not secret and that the technology had already been sold abroad. Pope sent a letter to Putin asking for clemency on the eve of his conviction, said his wife, Cheri. Cheri Pope had headed to the prison Thursday morning only hoping to visit her husband for the first time since the Dec. 6 verdict. She had been denied visits on several previous attempts, said Jennifer Bennett, spokeswoman for Pope's Pennsylvania Congressman, Rep. John Peterson. Instead, Pope was let go, and he and his wife soon were on a plane to Germany. Pope's company, TechSource Marine Industries, is based in State College, Pa.

Russia's lower house of parliament decided Friday to put off a bitter debate about whether to remove Vladimir Lenin's body from its mausoleum on Red Square. A reform-oriented party backed down from an effort to get lawmakers to ask President Vladimir Putin to decide the fate of Lenin's body, which has been on display under glass for decades. The Union of Right Forces had drafted an appeal to Putin suggesting that the mausoleum, which drew snaking lines of secular pilgrims in communist times, could become part of a museum of political repression. Reform politicians saw the idea as a sign of resistance to the recent return of Soviet-era symbols in Russia. The measure itself was largely symbolic, however, and had little chance of success. The Russian Communist Party vehemently objected to the measure, which had been scheduled for discussion Friday. A Communist Party statement called the proposal an attempt by ``neo-liberal right forces to exterminate everything related to the Soviet period of history from the citizens' consciousness.'' Other reform-oriented parties said it would be better to take up the fight later, and the party that had drafted the appeal asked that it be withdrawn from the agenda. Lenin died in 1924, at age 53, after a series of strokes. He had expressed a desire to be buried in St. Petersburg, but his body was soon put on display in Red Square. The Soviet founder's mummified corpse and the debate over its fate embody the schism that divides Russia between those who want to revive the Soviet Union and those who want the country to move on. Last week, the parliament approved Putin's suggestion that the melody of the Soviet national anthem be used for Russia's national hymn. ``In the long run, Lenin's body should be buried. But today it is not timely to discuss the topic,'' reformist lawmaker Grigory Yavlinsky's Yabloko party said in a statement. ``Lenin's mausoleum remains a sacred place for many citizens of Russia.''

About 500 active and retired FBI agents and support employees marched to the White House on Friday in a highly unusual protest, angered that President Clinton might commute the life sentence of an American Indian activist convicted of killing two FBI agents 25 years ago. Many agents wore their FBI badges defiantly pinned to their coats as they walked two-by-two in a long, silent protest around the Ellipse, the park immediately south of the White House, to the presidential mansion. At the front of the line several agents held a banner that said, ``Never Forget.'' For an agency whose workers regard themselves as civilian employees of an institution steeped in a paramilitary tradition, the protest was a serious break from discipline and order, reflecting the deep resentment many of agents feel toward Clinton because of the Peltier case. Within the agent workforce, Clinton has never been a widely popular president, in part because of what agents believe is his scarcely concealed disdain for FBI Director Louis J. Freeh. The march was not officially sanctioned, but many senior officials, including Freeh, quietly expressed approval even as they stayed away from the protest. The FBI marchers took vacation leave to join in the protest and did not participate at government expense, said Susan Lloyd, an agent who is a spokesman for the FBI's Washington field office. Clinton, who wields the sole discretion on clemency actions, has not said whether he will commute Peltier's sentence. But he told a radio interviewer in November that he would consider Peltier's request along with other clemency applications. Freeh wrote to Clinton last week expressing his ``abhorrence'' over the possibility that Peltier might be freed. Friday, Freeh spoke at a memorial service before the march that was held for the two slain agents, Ron A. Williams and Jack R. Coler. Peltier's supporters expressed shock that FBI employees would attempt to influence a clemency decision. ``I think its inappropriate and very disturbing for members of our government's armed police forces to march through the streets of Washington, D.C., to block the correction of the violation of rights that they inflicted not only on Peltier but on native Americans throughout the Pine Ridge reservation,'' said Jennifer K. Harbury, a lawyer for Peltier. At the time of the shootings, the two agents were searching for a robbery suspect on the Pine Ridge reservation in South Dakota. The agents, in separate cars, came under fire from assailants several hundred yards away. The agents were wounded in the attack and later killed by a gunman who stood over the men and fired into their heads. The government said at Peltier's trial that only he had a weapon of the type that investigators believed was used in the killings. Peltier has unsuccessfully appealed his conviction and has said that he did not shoot the agents. In recent years, an effort to free him has gained momentum. Last Sunday, supporters held a march near the United Nations in New York which attracted several thousand people. Clinton, like his predecessors, has frequently issued end-of-the-year pardons, and, supporters of several controversial clemency applicants regard Clinton final days in office as their last chance to obtain a Presidential grant of leniency. The peaceful protest prompted anti-FBI demonstrators to gather in small numbers near the march, holding signs criticizing the FBI over several controversial operations, like the tear gas assault on the Branch Davidian compound in 1993. Another anti-FBI demonstrator held a sign that said ``Free Peltier, Jail Horiuchi,'' referring to the agent who shot and killed the wife of a white separatist during a stand-off at remote cabin at Ruby Ridge, Idaho, in 1992.

After two difficult days of talks about old debts and dashed dreams with Fidel Castro, Russian President Vladimir Putin said Friday that he did not travel to this former bastion of the Cold War to re-create a ``union'' with Cuba against the United States, but rather to clean up the economic ``mess'' left over from the Soviet era. Speaking at a press conference that was not attended by the Cuban leader, Putin indicated in several ways that Russia's relations with the United States, though difficult at times, are important to Moscow. Still, he said that Moscow would not hesitate to express opposing views on arms control issues, on questions of international security and _ a new theme of his on this trip _ on how to narrow the gap between the ``golden billion'' and the world's poorest nations. Responding to a question on whether his visit here amounted to re-establishing an alliance between Moscow and Havana, Putin said: ``Unfortunately, you have been looking at the wrong kind of information. We have no union with Cuba against third countries, including the United States if you were talking about that country. ``Yes, we have differences on some questions with the United States and they are well known,'' he continued, but he said that these were ``items of discussion and no more than that.'' In stressing this point, Putin disclosed Friday that he had authorized his foreign minister, Igor Ivanov, to sign an agreement with the outgoing Clinton administration calling for advance notification of rocket launches to further promote transparency among the extensive nuclear forces of the United States and Russia. Putin said he ``deeply'' hoped the agreement would be concluded Friday, or in the near future. Ivanov was said to be negotiating the agreement in Brussels with Secretary of State Madeleine Albright. Putin's remarks Friday appeared to be an effort to put his visit to Cuba in the unthreatening context that Moscow is merely trying to recover lost markets and multimillion-dollar Soviet-era investments, rather than foment a new image of rivalry. And the subtext of his remarks, together with comments by Russian officials traveling with Putin, also indicated that the thorny economic issues underlying Moscow's relations with Cuba do not compare with the more weighty economic and security agenda, which Putin intends to pursue with the new administration in Washington. As an example, Putin cited his pardon on Thursday _ as a ``goodwill gesture'' _ of the American Edmond Pope, a former naval intelligence officer convicted of espionage in Moscow this month and sentenced to 20 years in prison. Putin said he had no reason to doubt the appropriateness of the guilty verdict against the 54-year-old businessman, but added that the activities of intelligence agencies, charged with protecting national security, ``should not inflict damage on relations between nations, the more so in the case of such key countries as Russia and the United States.'' On another point about continuing intelligence activities, the Russian leader indicated that the 1,500 Russian military technicians who operate an electronic eavesdropping facility at Lourdes, outside the Cuban capital and used to intercept communications in the United States, may not be here permanently. ``Russia and Cuba at this specific moment are interested that this center will continue to work,'' he said, adding, ``and then we'll see.'' As he prepared for the final rounds of tough negotiations with Castro over whether Cuba intends to even recognize the estimated $20 billion in debt that accumulated during three decades of Soviet patronage here, Putin also went out of his way to compliment the skill and experience of the foreign policy advisers that President-elect George W. Bush is gathering around him in Washington. ``Judging by the staff surrounding the president-elect,'' Putin observed, ``these people are quite well-known professionals, who deeply understand the nuances in relations between the two states.'' And the Russian leader was clear about the major differences of opinion: Moscow opposes Bush's advocacy toward abrogating the anti-ballistic missile treaty of 1972 in order to build an anti-missile shield over the United States and, in addition, ``we don't think that the principle of humanitarian intervention is right.'' He was referring to NATO's decision in 1999 to intervene militarily in Kosovo to stop Serbian forces from conducting a campaign of ethnic violence against civilians there. While Putin was speaking with reporters in Havana, Russian state television was airing a lengthy interview with Castro. Though Castro extolled the new friendship between Russia and Cuba, he restated his grievance that Cuba had been ``left alone'' by the circumstances of Soviet collapse and Russian withdrawal from Cuba, which had to face ``the most powerful state in the world.'' Castro made no reference to Cuba's residual debts to Moscow, and he avoided discussion of the complicated economic issues that he and Putin are trying to resolve. Putin and Castro will retreat to the luxurious beach resort of Varadero this weekend to try to conclude some common understanding of how Moscow and Havana can put substance behind the new vocabulary of friendship and economic cooperation. In describing the task, Putin said Russians have several goals in this first foray back to Latin America since Putin was elected last March. ``The first one is the activation of relations in the political sphere, cleaning up the mess and choosing priorities of cooperation between the two states in the economic sphere,'' he said. The Russian leader indicated Friday that Moscow has spent $30 million in recent years ``conserving'' its investment in a large nuclear power station at Jurgua, near Cienfuegos, but had come to no agreement about how to complete the plant. Russian officials traveling with Putin indicated that Cuba is no longer interested in completing the facility, but there has been no public confirmation of this position from Castro's government.

Marching two-by-two and wearing blue memorial ribbons, hundreds of FBI agents staged an unprecedented demonstration at the White House on Friday, protesting any presidential clemency for an American Indian activist convicted of killing two FBI men in 1975. The emotional procession of 500 current and former FBI employees and family members marched in a loop around the White House, led by two agents carrying banner with the red-lettered slogan ``Never Forget.'' A few agents blinked back tears as they displayed pictures of their slain colleagues, agents Ron Williams and Jack Koler. The agents hauled a bulky petition for President Clinton signed by 8,000 current and former agents protesting any easing of punishment for Leonard Peltier, 56, who is serving two consecutive life sentences in the federal prison at Leavenworth, Kan. Secret Service agents refused to take the petition, however, telling their fellow federal officers White House security forbids acceptance of any documents or packages. The agents planned to mail it. ``There are situations in which mercy is warranted, but clearly what this man has done puts him outside of the reach of any presidential pardon,'' said John Sennett, a New York-based agent and president of the FBI Agents Association, which has about 9,000 active and 1,000 retired members. The protest supported FBI Director Louis Freeh's recommendation to Clinton not to give Peltier clemency, saying such an act would ``signal disrespect'' for law enforcement. The White House has declined comment on any Clinton plans for pardons but has said the president would review pending requests for executive clemency, including Peltier's, before he leaves office in January. ``There are strong passions on all sides of the issue,'' said White House spokesman Elliot Diringer. ``The president's decision will be based on the facts.'' Agents Williams and Koler were killed June 26, 1975, on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota as they were searching for robbery suspects. Both were shot in the head at point-blank range after they were injured. The bodies were left on a dirt road. Peltier's story has become well known on Indian reservations across the country. After fleeing to Canada and being extradited to the United States, he was convicted and sentenced in 1977 for the killings, despite defense claims that evidence against him had been falsified. In El Paso, Texas, another 100 FBI agents protested Peltier's clemency request Friday, standing behind the city's top FBI agent, Edmundo Guevara, along a roadside in front of the agency's local headquarters as he read a statement against Peltier. Many of the agents demonstrating at the White House said they believe they are fighting more than just one man's claims of innocence _ they believe they are battling a myth that has swollen out of proportion. In prison, Peltier has written two books about the plight of Native Americans on reservations and his supporters are waging a national campaign for his release. A handful of Peltier supporters gathered to shout at the orderly line of officers as they passed. ``Peltier is a political prisoner,'' said a man who identified himself as P.J. Smith of Washington. ``We are very disappointed with the FBI response,'' Jennifer Harbury, an attorney for Peltier, said at a news conference before the march. ``We think it's inappropriate, and we think it's a sad day for democracy when our armed forces march through the streets to influence a decision for mercy and justice by a civilian president.'' The Peltier supporters said the FBI targeted him because of his vocal support of autonomy for reservations. Susan Lloyd, an FBI field office spokeswoman who joined the protesters, said the vast majority of those in the demonstration were active agents. All applied for the day off, she said. ``None of this is on government time,'' she said. At FBI headquarters, spokesman Mike Korton said, ``FBI employees, like other federal workers and citizens, have the right to express their views on issues they feel passionately about.'' ___ On the Net: House Judiciary Committee: http://www.house.gov/judiciary Leonard Peltier Defense Committee: http://www.freepeltier.org No Parole Peltier Association: http://www.noparolepeltier.com

Russian President Vladimir Putin said Friday he pardoned U.S. businessman Edmond Pope as a ``goodwill gesture'' toward the United States and the incoming Bush administration. Putin, who ordered Pope's release Thursday, said he hoped the action would show that such cases do not have to damage relations between the two nations. ``I hope that a goodwill gesture made by Russia in relation to Mr. Pope wouldn't hamper the development of bilateral relations,'' Putin told reporters during a state visit to Cuba. The case, the first in 40 years in which an American was convicted of spying in Russia, has raised questions about the growing power of Russia's security services. Pope, who denied he was a spy, was flown to Germany after his release. Putin, a former KGB agent, defended the court that convicted Pope and the security services, saying: ``The court sentence has clearly and precisely shown Mr. Pope's guilt, and we have no doubt of the fairness of the verdict.'' ``The activities of both intelligence and counterintelligence services mustn't damage bilateral relations, and, especially, ties between such major powers as Russia and the United States,'' Putin said. Putin also welcomed President-elect George W. Bush's new administration. ``We know the team surrounding the president-elect quite well,'' he said. ``It's a team of professionals who deeply know all intricacies of relations between Russia and the United States.''

afghanistan is the current focus for investigators of the "uss cole" bombing. david ensor reports. u.s. and yemeni officials say key suspects in the bombing of the "uss cole" have fled to safety in afghanistan. in fact, a senior yemeni official tells cnn that the man investigators believe organized the attack, the saudi citizen of yemeni origin named mohammed omar alha rausy, is in afghanistan, too. u.s. officials say it is logical that alha rausy, who's allegedly an explosives expert working for accused terrorist osama bin laden, would be in afghanistan, but said they could not confirm his whereabouts. in house testimony wednesday, however, state department counterterrorism chief michael sheehan said, "while we do not have full information on who planned and carried out the attack on the 'uss cole,' we do know that numerous people immediately left yemen for afghanistan." afghanistan's ruling taliban government also shelters bin laden. investigators have said all along they suspect bin laden's al-kieda group was behind the bombing. at the white house, counterterrorism coordinator richard clark said, the taliban government can expect only international isolation. then there are governments like afghanistan, which are engaged in the smuggling of heroin and the harboring of terrorists. and, you know, governments such as afghanistan, i think have to be considered criminal organizations. next week at the united nations, the security council is expected to pass a u.s. and russian-sponsored resolution imposing an arms embargo and other restrictions on the taliban. administration officials say they believe the incoming bush administration will also favor tightening the screws on the taliban until they give up bin laden. david ensor, cnn, washington.

BERLIN (AP) _ U.S. businessman Edmond Pope was discharged Saturday from a U.S. military hospital where he had been undergoing tests since his release after months in a Russian prison on espionage charges, a hospital spokeswoman said. Pope, the first American convicted of espionage in Russia in 40 years, will be heading home Sunday or Monday. He was pardoned Thursday by Russian President Vladimir Putin and immediately flew to Ramstein Air Base in Germany. ``If he is discharged, he is in good condition,'' said Marie Shaw, a spokeswoman at the hospital in Landstuhl, near Frankfurt. Pope, 54, has suffered in the past from a rare form of bone cancer, and doctors said Friday it was unclear if it had resurfaced. They also ran tests for three lesions that were possible skin cancer. Shaw said she did not know the results of those tests and could not release any information without Pope's consent. Pope, who was held for 253 days before his release, was to leave for the United States on a regular flight, Shaw said. His first destination will be Oregon, where his mother is caring for his ailing father, Shaw said. ``He's very concerned about his father,'' she said. The Popes intend to be back in their hometown of State College, Penn. for Christmas. Until his departure, Pope is staying with his wife, Cheri, in a hotel located on Ramstein Air Base, which he is entitled to use because he is a retired U.S. Navy officer. ``He's happy and eating well, relaxing with his wife,'' Shaw said. Pope was sentenced to 20 years in jail by a Moscow court on Dec. 6. He has denied the charges that he obtained secret torpedo technology, saying the information has been published. He was in a business meeting in Moscow for his company, CERF Technologies International, last April when a dozen security agents stormed in and arrested him and the Russians who were in the room. Pope said Friday he had not been mistreated while in Moscow's high-security Lefortovo prison, but the lack of vitamins from his bland diet of porridge, potatoes, fish and soup took a toll on his health. ``There was no physical abuse,'' he said. ``They were extremely careful with me. It was clear to my after a while that I was there for political reasons.''

American officials are on guard against possible terrorist attacks during the holiday season, U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen said Saturday. Cohen was aboard the aircraft carrier USS Truman off the Italian coast, the first stop of a four-day trip to visit U.S. troops in Italy and the Balkans. ``We're trying to anticipate whether or not there will be any action that might coincide with the end of Ramadan and the beginning of our Christmas holidays,'' the outgoing defense secretary said. ``It is a period that we watch very closely.'' Earlier this month, Cohen authorized the deployment of extra Navy and Coast Guard personnel in the Persian Gulf, stepping up security in the aftermath of the Oct. 12 terrorist bombing of the USS Cole in Yemen that killed 17 sailors. Cohen also said that the transformation of the U.S. military into a ``more rapidly deployable, lighter and more sustainable'' force is ``irreversible,'' and that the new administration led by President-elect George W. Bush will have to follow the same path. ``These initiatives are essential if we're going to transform the force that we had in the 20th century into one of the 21st century,'' Cohen said. ``I don't see any prospects of them fading away.'' Cohen said such a force would be better equipped against the challenges the United States and Europe will confront in the upcoming years, such as transnational terrorism, the use of chemical and biological weapons and political instability. Cohen was on his fourth and last tour of U.S. troops abroad. ``It is the most exhausting job one could possibly ever have,'' he said of his tenure as defense secretary, addressing hundreds of soldiers in the ship's hangar. ``It's also the most rewarding.'' Accompanying Cohen on his visit to the carrier was his wife, Janet, and a lineup of celebrities that include football Hall-of-Famer Terry Bradshaw and the Dallas Cowboys cheerleaders. The Truman is a new, nuclear-powered vessel on its first deployment. It carries a crew of 5,000.

Dozens of prisoners on a 58-day hunger strike are near death, a prisoners' group said Saturday. Some 250 prisoners linked to left-wing groups are refusing everything but water to protest transfers from their dormitory-style open wards to one- or three-person cells. The prisoners say the cells would leave them vulnerable to abuse by authorities. Mediation efforts ended Friday over what Justice Minister Hikmet Sami Turk called the prisoners' ``unacceptable'' demand to be housed in 20-person rooms. The government wants to break up large wards, which it cannot control and where riots and hostage-takings are frequent. ``Only hours are left till death,'' a statement from Ozgur Tayad, a solidarity group for prisoners' families said. It said the prisoners would not abandon the strike until their demand is met. Dr. Umit Erkol, head of an Ankara-based physicians' association whose members have visited some of the prisoners, said ``we can expect the worst now.'' The independent Human Rights Association said about 20 prisoners were in critical condition.

NEW YORK (AP) _ ``Dear Santa: Please bring me a hit show. My old shows are broken. I need a new one fast. I promise I've been good. ``Love, (network programming executive). ``P.S.: I hope you like the milk and cookies and production deal.'' Well, that's one way to fight back from a fall season boasting few successes, lots of flops and mostly unhappy surprises (maybe you recall that before its premiere a few short weeks ago, CBS' sputtering ``The Fugitive'' was widely pegged as a can't-miss proposition). After three months, a familiar question takes on new urgency: Who let these dogs out? Why did the Fox high-finance soap ``The $treet'' go bust? What was the big idea with NBC's crass comedy ``Tucker'' and dead-on-arrival drama ``Deadline''? How could anyone squander a huge star like John Goodman, who Fox squandered in a big way on its just-canceled ``Normal, Ohio''? Despite the networks' wish list, they got a lot of coal and switches on the schedule. But even if there's no Santa for TV execs, all is not lost. Here are a few breakthrough tricks of the trade for avoiding flops, identifying hits and assembling a winning lineup. _ What Does Alan Greenspan Think? Sure, his wife is NBC News correspondent Andrea Mitchell. But that's no guarantee the busy Federal Reserve chief watches a lot of TV _ or that, even if he does, he would have much to say about market corrections for ``Girlfriends'' or ``Nikki.'' But what if his insight into the financial world, and his vast impact on it, could be harnessed by TV programmers? What if Greenspan could rescue ``Freakylinks''? Recently he signaled that the Fed stands ready to cut interest rates if the economy seems headed into a recession. Hmmmm. Buried in that message, for those who can decrypt it, might be sound advice on raising the viewer interest rate for ``Gideon's Crossing'' or ``Bette.'' When Alan Greenspan clears his throat, Wall Street quakes. Just imagine his effect on a struggling sitcom if he laughed! _ What Would David Blaine Do? It would have been beyond even the powers of Blaine, an illusionist famous for his sleight of hand and levitations, to trick the TV audience into watching a fiasco like ABC's ``The Trouble With Normal,'' or to levitate that sitcom's ratings out of the hole. But Blaine's latest stunt, aired last month on an ABC special, found him spending 62 hours encased in a 6-ton block of ice. TV bosses might well follow his lead. The benefits are obvious: a cooling-off period from e-mail, phones and screenings; a chance to chill before you do something stupid like put ``DAG'' on your schedule. Just ask Garth Ancier, dismissed this week as entertainment president of NBC: Getting frozen would have sure beat getting iced. _ How About Feng Shui? You've heard of feng shui, the ancient Chinese system of managing good fortune by putting the man-made world in alignment with nature. From a building's front door, where the ``chi,'' or life force, enters, to the toilet, where ``chi'' drains away, feng shui says that nothing should be left to chance. So why not put feng shui to work in TV decision-making? For instance, before NBC moved ``Titans'' to Monday, where the steamy soap faltered just like it did in its Wednesday slot, the network could have tried to align this enterprise with the natural flow of the Universal Life Force. A feng shui practitioner might have discouraged shifting the show, yet urged shifting a vase in Yasmine Bleeth's boudoir as a way to let the energy resonate with NBC's highest ideals (the ratings). On the other hand, ABC's ``Madigan Men'' was probably a lost cause from the beginning. Listless and unfunny, that sitcom, like its life force, started, not just ended, in the loo. _ The Mir, The Merrier? NBC had high hopes for an out-of-this-world reality series, with contestants vying for a chance to blast off for the Russian space station Mir. But Russia's Cabinet decided to send the deteriorating Mir hurtling into the Pacific Ocean in February. Still, NBC is exploring ways to salvage the project, dubbed ``Destination Mir.'' Here's how, and at the same time triumphantly dispose of one of NBC's biggest, costliest duds: Launch the entire cast of ``The Michael Richards Show'' into space, headed for Mir or its general vicinity (and don't forget the writers). Then, when they get there, let the chips, along with everything else, fall where they may. And pray it all happens on camera, during February sweeps. ___ On the Net: Funny Site About TV Flops: http://www.jumptheshark.com. Feng Shui Site: http://www.qi-whiz.com. ___ Elsewhere in television ... `GILMORE GIRLS' TIMES 2: It's a double dose of ``Gilmore Girls'' this week.

It takes more than a translator to translate the big, long-worked-at novel that secured this year's Nobel Prize for the Chinese writer Gao Xingjian. The reader must translate as well, feeling for equivalents through the stiffish (though no doubt accurate) English of Mabel Lee, in order to sense the drift of a writer who both suggests and withdraws his suggestions; both reveals and veils; both asserts and distracts. ``Soul Mountain'' is a journey, a double one. It is the narrator's trek through China's present: haunted and disputed by the past and shriveled, in his telling, by comparison with it. It is also his attempt to seek an identity disassembled by this haunting, disputing and shriveling. Dreamlike and concretely detailed by turns, the journey has no arriving and the search no finding. And so, a three-cushion cue-shot at an equivalence, differently voiced: Federico Garcia Lorca's A white moon, a black nag, and olives in my saddlebag. Though I know the roads, I shall never get to Cordoba. ``Soul Mountain'' travels roads as intricately intertwined as a double helix to a destination that eludes it. Near the end, the narrator asks an old man whether he has gone the wrong way. ``The road is not wrong, it is the traveler who is wrong,'' is the Zen-like reply. And at the very end, he comes upon God in the shape of a small green frog that communicates by blinking its eyes. ``Whether I understand or not is not God's concern,'' the narrator remarks. Nor, as he lets us know, is it Gao's. His 81 chapters are an often bewildering and considerably uneven congeries of forms: vignettes, travel writing, ethnographic jottings, daydreams, nightmares, recollections, conversations, lists of dynasties and archaeological artifacts, erotic encounters, legends, current history, folklore, political, social and ecological commentary, philosophical epigrams, vivid poetical evocation and much else. They are told through a narrator who has split four ways. He is an ``I.'' He is a ``you,'' since ``I'' is tired of his own voice and wants someone to talk to and take charge of fantasy while ``I'' is catching buses. He is a ``she,'' because the first two are sexily susceptible; and occasionally a ``he,'' when ``I'' and ``you'' blur and need to refocus. All this is better understood when not closely examined; once a reader gets accustomed, it is only somewhat distracting. Gao, born in 1940, wrote prolifically until the Cultural Revolution when, for fear of arrest or worse, he burned his writings. After that he began again, his work privately celebrated among the intelligentsia and alternately tolerated and suppressed by the authorities. When imminent arrest was rumored during a crackdown, he left Beijing and spent half a year traveling in the mountains of Sichuan and exploring the western reaches of the Yangtze River, travels that would provide the structure and much of the material for the ``I'' portions of ``Soul Mountain.'' In 1987, allowed to go abroad, he moved to France. A novel in theory, ``Soul Mountain'' is more nearly a collection of the musings, memories and poetic, sometimes mystical fantasies of a gifted, angry writer. These are set into an autobiographical framework, a form he is as much at war with as he is with modern China. The result, emerging periodically along with all the rest in a fascinating account of his country, is a reversal of the writer's ``this is.'' In other words, ``This isn't''; or the ``Nothing lives less in me than myself'' of Werner Herzog's character Kaspar Hauser. ``I'' and his dreamy counterpart, ``you,'' have fled the cabals, criticisms, counter-criticisms and politics of the day to seek out the remains of a more authentic China with its millennial culture, history, landscape and folkways. As was true of the author, ``they'' have received a diagnosis of incurable cancer, only to have the diagnosis reversed. In the middle of life's path, like Dante, ``they'' are similarly ready for a summons to something greater. ``You'' is directed to look for the metaphysical Lingshan _ literally, soul mountain _ while ``I'' begins the material aspect of their journey. ``While you search for the route to Lingshan, I wander along the Yangtze River looking for this sort of reality,'' he tells his soulful half. In fact, many of soulful ``you's'' adventures consist of erotic, tragicomic and shrewdly if chauvinistically portrayed tangles with an alternately lustful and woebegone ``she.'' Why do I think of Harpo, with his dreamy look and salacious car horn? ``I'' does the legwork, and ultimately it is the legwork, more than the speculation, the philosophy, the sometimes less-than-haunting haunts and identity games, that is the most accessible, at least to this reader. Not all of it, by any means; ``Soul Mountain'' is the emptying of an immense, indiscriminately filled pocket: gems and pack-rat gleanings, both. The legwork is powered by anger and an aching sense of loss. ``I'' starts in the wild border areas of the old Han empire, with their spectacular mountains and indigenous peoples. His accounts of fire dancers, shamans, folk singers and monks evoke the rich differences that Communism sought to suppress and that the capitalist post-Revolution may end up extinguishing. There are any number of splendid scenes: a Miao festival, a Daoist monk performing a clandestine ritual, the life of a ranger who has retired to the mountain forests to preserve them. The author, who is also a painter, gives us the dark forests, mists and crags of the western regions. He is equally good with the bustle of small towns and the life of the road. There is a rural bus driver who protests a fine by going on strike, leaving his passengers stranded. There is the countrywide network of intellectuals and professionals who flock to talk with the itinerant, semi-proscribed ``I'' (the author, of course) and lodge, feed and show him a good time. There are stories, conversations and _ all right, if ``you'' is Harpo, surely ``I'' can be Groucho _ flirting. The defect in ``Soul Mountain'' is not obscurity, though there is a fair amount, but lofty woolliness. Postmodern epistemologies, as loosely cast as a net, entangle it. What the net contains _ slash away, reader _ is treasure. PUBLICATION NOTES: `Soul Mountain' By Gao Xingjian. Translated from Chinese by Mabel Lee. 510 pp. HarperCollins. $27.

Not too long ago, Senator-elect Jean Carnahan read a magazine article about coping with severe stress, a condition that can strike people who experience one of the following: the death of a spouse, the death of a child, the loss of a friend, a move to a new town, a job change. ``And I said, `Oh, my heavens, all these things are happening to me,''' said Carnahan, 66, over a plate of pasta and a cup of tea in the Dirksen building cafeteria recently. ``I should have read the article more closely.'' Wherever she goes in the Capitol nowadays, Carnahan is celebrated for her courage and good humor; strangers want to hug her, colleagues want to share their own misfortune. Recently Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., handed her a well-worn copy of a book by his brother John F. Kennedy, ``Profiles in Courage.'' Three weeks before the election, Carnahan's high school sweetheart, confidant and husband of 45 years, Gov. Mel Carnahan of Missouri, died in a plane crash. Her oldest son, Randy, who was flying the plane, died with him, as did an aide to the governor, Chris Sifford. Mel Carnahan, a Democrat, was challenging John Ashcroft, the Republican incumbent, for his Senate seat in a hard-fought, often bitter race. But Jean Carnahan had little time to absorb the shock. Just days after she buried her husband and son, Carnahan received a call from the state's new governor, Roger Wilson, who posed a series of hypothetical questions: Let's say her husband was elected posthumously, would she be willing to fill the seat? ``I had to think long and hard about it,'' Carnahan said. ``I knew it would be quite a dramatic step for me. And I didn't know whether the people of Missouri would go to the polls and vote for someone who was dead. There was no one there saying you ought to do this. In fact, people stayed away from that. ``I almost felt as if my world had come to an end,'' she added. ``But I didn't want all the things that Mel stood for, that we had worked together for for 17 years, I didn't want those things to die. I didn't want to feel like I was letting myself down or him down. And the people of Missouri wanted something to survive that plane crash, as well.'' Jean Carnahan, a ``Jimmy Carter Baptist,'' as she put it, prayed and consulted with her children. One pivotal moment, she said, came during an interview with Cokie Roberts, when Roberts recounted how her own mother, Lindy Boggs, coped with the loss of her husband, Hale, who died in a plane crash in 1972. Still reeling from the loss of her husband, Boggs decided to fill her husband's congressional seat. This new-found sense of purpose in her mother's life, Roberts said, guided her through her grief. ``I decided I would just go with my heart and soul and do what I knew he would want me to do,'' Carnahan said. With her sweetness and sharp pantsuits, Carnahan is the picture of the modern grandmother, a widow with guts. But she knows she must flesh out the portrait if she is to be taken seriously, and be re-elected. Her presence as a Democrat in a seat formerly held by a Republican is critical to her party in the evenly divided Senate. But she has already met with centrist senators like Democrat John Breaux of Louisiana and Republicans Susan Collins and Olympia Snowe of Maine, and says she plans to work in the middle, listening, and focusing first on education. Born in Washington on Dec. 20, 1933, Carnahan met her future husband at a church youth group in the early 1950s. Then, thanks to every school's systematic reliance on alphabetical order, Jean Carpenter wound up sitting next to Mel Carnahan at Anacostia High School. After promising his father he would not marry until after graduating from college, Mel Carnahan raced through George Washington University in three years. Three days after graduation the two were married, and a short while later, Jean Carnahan completed her own studies in business administration at the same university. The couple had four children, who all became lawyers _ ``not a brain surgeon among them,'' Carnahan lamented. As a young wife, Carnahan jumped wholeheartedly into political life and served as her husband's trusted adviser. She always wrote her own speeches, and sometimes wrote his. Much of what happened before the election Carnahan calls a blur. ``I guess I didn't dare let myself think that it was possible,'' she said. ``We were asking the people of Missouri to do an awful lot. But I guess I kind of got a feeling that something was happening out there.'' She first noticed that ``something'' on the day of her husband's burial, when she set out from Jefferson City to the family farm in Rolla. Someone whispered to her to hurry up. ``I said, What are you talking about?'' she recalled. ``He said people are waiting all along the way. Sure enough, as we started, each town we went through _ there are about four or five towns along the way, and it was dusk _ people were standing there with candles and posters, and they were singing. ``It was just a very moving and solemn time,'' she added. ``So I could tell this had affected people in a very deep way.'' On election night, Carnahan, surrounded by her children and a few of her husband's former aides, flipped on the television set, for the first time since her husband's death, to watch the returns. Her husband had been trailing Ashcroft all evening, and Carnahan said she was going to bed. But several people urged her to stay, since the vote tally from St. Louis was still out. She sat back down. ``At 12:45 it was officially declared,'' Carnahan said. ``My daughter turned and put her hand on my leg and said, `We've won.' And my son came over, and we just hugged each other and cried.''

The main threats to U.S. territory over the coming 15 years will likely come from terrorists and other adversaries using low-tech tools of war, according to a sweeping new study by intelligence analysts and non-goverment experts. This threat is made more worrisome by a trend toward increasing collusion among terrorists, drug traffickers, weapons proliferators and organized crime, according to the assessment ``Global Trends 2015,'' published Monday. ``Most adversaries will recognize the information advantage and military superiority of the United States in 2015,'' the report said. ``Rather than acquiesce to any potential U.S. military domination, they will try to circumvent or minimize U.S. strengths and exploit perceived weaknesses.'' The most recent example of this approach was the terrorist bombing of the USS Cole on Oct. 12 as it refueled in Aden, Yemen. A small boat maneuvered alongside the huge destroyer and, without drawing attention from the ship's security forces, detonated explosives that tore a hole in the ship and killed 17 sailors. Monday's report said this kind of approach _ known as ``asymmetric warfare'' _ will threaten U.S. interests not only abroad but also at home. ``Such asymmetric approaches _ whether undertaken by states or nonstate actors _ will become the dominant characteristic of most threats to the U.S. homeland,'' the report said. This will become the ``defining challenge'' of U.S. national security strategy and military force development in coming years. High-tech threats also will loom large, the report said. ``Advances in science and technology will pose national security challenges of uncertain character and scale,'' it said. ``Increasing reliance on computer networks is making critical U.S. infrastructures more attractive as targets. Computer network operations today offer new options for attacking the United States within its traditional continental sanctuary, potentially anonymously and with selective effects.'' Highlights of the study were first reported in Monday's editions of the New York Times and Washington Post. The Times said copies of the report were given last week to President-elect Bush's team. The assessment also looked at global economic, political, and resource trends. It predicted that Russia would continue to face problems. It will be ``challenged even more than today to adjust its expectations for world leadership to its dramatically reduced resources.'' The report concluded that the most likely outcome is that Russia will remain internally weak through 2015. The experts had a mixed view of China. ``Working against China's aspirations to sustain economic growth while preserving its political system is an array of political, social, and economic pressures that will increasingly challenge the regime's legitimacy, and perhaps its survival,'' they concluded. On the other hand, China may introduce enough political reform to adapt to domestic pressure for change. The report was 15 months in the making and was directed by the National Intelligence Council, a group of intelligence officials representing all elements of the U.S. national security establishment, including the Central Intelligence Agency, the Defense Intelligence Agency and the State Department's Bureau of Intelligence and Research. Also contributing were experts from private think tanks and academic institutions.

The White House said Monday it wasn't seeking permission, but was talking with advisers to President-elect Bush about whether President Clinton should visit communist North Korea before he leaves office. Clinton, who expects to make his decision before Christmas, will likely talk about the possible trip during his meeting with Bush Tuesday at the White House, said press secretary Jake Siewert. But Siewert stressed it would be Clinton's decision. ``The president will make that decision based on his own assessment of whether a trip will be useful in advancing America's national interest,'' Siewert said. Siewert said a possible Clinton trip to North Korea also would likely surface in a meeting Monday between Clinton's national security adviser Sandy Berger and Bush's national security adviser Condoleezza Rice. ``We're consulting and have been consulting with the president-elect's team on this and those consultations will continue,'' Siewert said. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright met with North Korea's Kim Jong Il in October to try to pave the way for a possible Clinton visit. Follow-up missile talks were held in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, but no agreements were reached. The United States is concerned about North Korean exports to Pakistan, Iran and other countries. The North Korean leader has indicated a willingness to curb missile development and missile exports in exchange for economic ties with the United States.

A volcano near Mexico City spouted spectacular showers of incandescent rock and ash late Monday, one of Popocatepetl's biggest eruptions since returning to life six years ago. Television showed footage of Monday's lava shower, which spread against the night sky like a fireworks show and prompted many residents of small, nearby towns to finally heed officials' pleas to evacuate. It was unclear how far down the flanks the lava was falling, but it appeared only about a half mile down the slope. President Vicente Fox, speaking after an emergency cabinet meeting, said some smaller incandescent particles had fallen as far as six miles from the crater. ``We continue on maximum alert, because this emergency is not over,'' Fox told a news conference after the rock shower appeared to have died down. The eruption appeared to be the largest emission of molten rock from the peak since it rumbled back from a 70-year period of dormancy in 1994. The nearest villages, almost all now completely evacuated, are about four miles away. With sirens wailing, police drove through the deserted streets of Santiago Xalitzintla, one of the closest villages, shouting through bullhorns for the few remaining inhabitants to leave. Some refused. ``It could have been worse if this had been a brief, extremely violent eruption,'' said Servando de la Cruz, a scientist at the National Autonomous University of Mexico. ``It was a relatively moderate emission that lasted about an hour.'' ``In the next few hours, we'll have to see if more energy builds up,'' De la Cruz said. ``These kind of events could be repeated.'' The volcano also spewed a cloud of ash 2 1/2 miles high, which appeared to be blowing away from Mexico City 40 miles away. ``No major atmospheric effects are expected over large cities,'' Fox said. Up until now, there have been no forced evacuations in the two dozen villages around the volcano, and officials say about 40,000 people have left the highest-risk area at the urging of the government. Even as van-loads of residents fled down the slopes in the minutes after the eruption, some of those living within the seven-mile danger zone around the peak said they still would not leave. ``If we have to die, we have to die,'' said Julia Sanchez of San Nicolas, who was among those staying behind to guard belongings and livestock. ``The government is not going to pay for what we could lose.'' But deep rumbling from the volcano overnight, and the spectacular shower of red-hot rock over the high flanks of the peak Monday, prompted more locals to pack their cars. ``They already told us to leave, but we didn't believe them _ until last night. Now we are scared,'' said Javier Hernandez, 71, huddled around a fire with five other men. Six female relatives slept under blankets in the back of a nearby pickup. ``We didn't sleep at all last night,'' he said. ``It was thundering loudly.'' Scientists have warned that lava at the base of the 17,886-foot Popocatepetl (pronounced poh-poh-kah-TEH-peh-til) is causing pressure to build inside the mountain. That could trigger a strong eruption, throwing rocks and other debris for miles. ``It's like a pressure cooker,'' Interior Secretary Santiago Creel said. ``It could lead to a situation the likes of which we've never seen.'' The volcano, locally known as ``Popo'' or ``Don Goyo,'' sits 40 miles southeast of Mexico City. A major eruption is unlikely to do more than dust the metropolitan area's 20 million residents with ash. But some airlines have canceled flights to Mexico City for fear that ash already spewed by the volcano may damage their engines. The last evacuation occurred in December 1994, when the volcano came back to life after lying dormant since 1927. It has been 800 years since its last catastrophic eruption.

Soldiers stormed at least six prisons throughout Turkey early Tuesday to force about 200 prisoners to end their more than two-month-long hunger strike. Shots were heard outside Istanbul's Bayrampasa prison, private television NTV reported, and fires were reported in at least two penitentiaries The hunger strikes were in protest of plans to transfer them from dormitories to small jail cells. Past raids by authorities in the dormitories have led to violent clashes and several inmate deaths. Busloads of soldiers were seen entering at least six prisons at about 5 a.m.. Only two women inmates have so far been brought to hospitals Tuesday morning, from a prison in Ankara. Mediation failed to end the hunger strikes, and the health of the fasting prisoners was rapidly deteriorating. At least 20 inmates were said to be in critical condition after refusing food for 61 days. Twelve leftist inmates starved themselves to death in 1996 before the government abandoned plans to transfer them. Inmates refused to be transferred to Turkey's new prisons with cells designed to hold one to three prisoners. Inmates argue they would be more vulnerable to torture by guards in smaller cells. Human rights groups say torture is common in Turkish prisons. The government says it cannot control the large wards, where up to 100 prisoners live crowded together. Authorities say political groups run the wards like indoctrination centers. Riots and hostage-takings are routine.

Every thousand years or so, the great Popocatepetl explodes with killing force, and as it rumbled and puffed this weekend, government officials monitoring geophysicists' instruments pleaded with thousands of villagers under the volcano to flee. Few did. People fought to stay put, even after it erupted violently throughout Monday night and Tuesday morning, flinging glowing 5-foot rocks for miles, in what is believed to be its biggest bang in more than a millennium. They felt strongly that the volcano _ their volcano, revered as the god of rain and giver of rich soil _ was more benevolent a force than their government. ``The people in the villages consider Popo a friendly volcano, the beating heart of the land,'' said Homero Aridjis, a poet, former diplomat and president of PEN, the international writers' association. ``It's our Indian beliefs against European science.'' Maybe they were right: Though the mountain is hurling incandescent bombs, potentially threatening everyone for 20 miles around, it has killed no one yet. But this clash of verities versus technology _ or human nature against nature _ is an old story. And since the volcano still is capable of an immense explosion, it is far from over. Scientists and the government continued to warn that there could be a full-blown eruption, with rivers of lava pouring down the slopes. The volcano is visible from Mexico City, a metropolis of 18 million people 40 miles to the northwest. So far, winds have carried the ash and smoke south, sparing the city a rain of soot that some had feared would clog the already polluted air and shut down its busy airport. All day Monday and Tuesday, government sound trucks went through villages near the volcano, blaring warnings, church bells rang out danger and army commanders appeared with evacuation orders. But thousands resisted the call. Vicente Jimenez, a 26-year-old corn farmer from Santiago Xanitzintla, about 7 miles from the flaming crater, heard all the alarms and was unmoved. ``We never left,'' he said on Tuesday. ``We don't feel comfortable leaving our homes and everything we own in the hands of the authorities. For many people leaving was hard enough, but leaving our homes in the hands of the police is even harder.'' A fellow farmer who stayed behind, Adolfo Castro, 55, said: ``This is a very old village. The church is important to us, and there was no one guarding it. There are antiquities inside that go back centuries.'' An army commander charged with carrying out an evacuation on Tuesday shook his head. ``It's too late to be fighting with these people,'' he said. ``They've shut themselves in behind four locks. They are older people who will never leave.'' More than 20,000 people appeared to have turned down the government's offers of transportation, food and shelter. ``Their resistance is reasonable, based on their experience,'' said Luis Gonzalez y Gonzalez, a historian at the National College. ``The people have nothing to identify with but their families and their land.'' After nearly seven decades of deep sleep, 17,945-foot Popocatepetl (pronounced poh-poh-kah-TEH-peh-tel _ but known as Popo) became active again in December 1994. Since then, government scientists have erected a world-class monitoring network of sensors around it, measuring its internal pressure and recording its smallest tremors. The Mexican government also set up 1,232 shelters with room for more than 300,000 people. It accurately predicted the eruption, broadcast the warning clearly and yet could not persuade people to leave through reason alone. Part of this resistance lies in village traditions. People call the volcano Don Gregorio or Don Goyo for short, and see him as a living, giving creature. Shamans in the villages communicate with him and insist he will not hurt people unless people hurt him. ``People here still carry gifts up the mountain, a stewpot of turkey with mole, a basket of fruits,'' said Tomas Jimenez, Vicente's father, who said his family has lived in Santiago Xanitzintla for centuries. ``They ask for a better harvest or more rain.'' Part of the fight against flight has an even deeper foundation, though. ``It's human nature,'' said Dan Miller, a research geologist and the chief of the U.S. Volcano Disaster Assistance Program, which is based in Vancouver, Wash., and has worked in more than a dozen countries, throughout Latin America, in Asia and Africa. ``Wherever we go in the world we have met with the same kind of problem,'' said Miller, whose program is run by the U.S. Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance and the U.S. Geological Survey. ``People who live in high-risk zones around volcanoes don't expect an eruption to take place, and if it did, they don't expect it to affect them. Government scientists in the U.S. and elsewhere meet with mistrust when they issue proclamations or recommendations. People don't understand or believe their warnings.'' The same thing happened during Mount St. Helen's eruption in Washington state 20 years ago. ``When Mount St. Helen's woke up after 123 years, a fair number of people refused to be evacuated, and many of the 57 people killed had illegally entered into closed-off and restricted areas,'' Miller said. Late last year in Ecuador, at least 22,000 villagers were evacuated by the government when the 16,475-foot volcano called Tungurahua _ ``Throat of Fire'' in the Quechua Indian language _ showed signs that a violent explosion was coming. ``Now 15 months have gone by and the predicted devastating events haven't occurred,'' Miller said. ``And the people have fought their way through military barricades back home. And they're there now, even though the eruptions continue.'' On Tuesday evening, though some villages were all but deserted, it appeared that roughly 30,000 people _ slightly more than half of the 56,000 people the government wanted to protect _ had accepted the offer of shelter, said Santiago Creel, the interior minister. Creel, who like the rest of the government of President Vicente Fox has been in power only 18 days, said he saw the futility of forcing the others to leave. ``We don't think there's a clear way for us to remove the whole population,'' he said.

Turkish soldiers stormed 20 prisons Tuesday to force an end to a mass hunger strike, prompting clashes that killed two soldiers. At least 15 inmates were dead, most of them leftist prisoners who set themselves on fire. Some 200 prisoners went on a hunger strike two months ago to protest plans to transfer them to smaller cells, fearing they would be more vulnerable to abuse if housed in cells. The planned transfers were part of a government effort to break up large prison wards, which they say are used by prisoners as indoctrination centers. The government accuse inmates of smuggling in guns, as well as staging riots, strikes and taking hostages to press for demands. Soldiers stormed the prisons simultaneously at around 5 a.m., Justice Minister Hikmet Sami Turk said. Troops reportedly broke through the walls at Umraniye prison and dropped from helicopters at Bayrampasa prison in Istanbul. Some inmates fought back, killing two soldiers _ one at Umraniye and another at a prison in the western town of Canakkale _ and wounding three others, Turk said. Fifteen inmates also died, most of them from setting themselves on fire, and 57 others were injured, Turk said. Turkey's independent Human Rights Association and Ozgur Tayad, an association of prisoners' relatives, put the inmate death toll at 17. At least 25 prisoners were seriously hurt, the Human Right Association said. The government has long sought to break up the prison wards, some of which house up to 100 prisoners and are decorated with rebel flags. Tuesday's action establishes ``the state's sovereignty'' in Turkey's prisons, Turk said. ``From now on, the ward system in Turkish prisons will be absolutely out of question,'' he said. Some 72,000 inmates are housed in Turkey's prisons, which are so overcrowded that some have been sharing beds. The government is trying to pass an amnesty bill that would release nearly half of the prisoners. Those linked to outlawed political groups would not be released under the amnesty. Human rights groups say torture is common in Turkish prisons, and leftist and Kurdish inmates claim they are singled out for abuse. Most of the hunger strikers, who have demanded that the government drop plans to transfer them to cells, belong to outlawed leftist and Marxist groups. Turk said Tuesday that the transfers already have begun. Other raids of wards housing political prisoners also have led to deadly clashes with inmates armed with guns and makeshift flame-throwers. There are 571 inmates now in hospitals, including 434 who are on a rotating hunger strike, the Interior Ministry said. The raids were launched after mediation failed to end the hunger strikes, Turk said. At least 20 inmates reportedly are in critical condition after refusing food for 61 days. Many are refusing treatment, said Fusun Sayek, head of the Turkish Physicians' Association, which considers it unethical to treat people against their will. ``You cannot expect the state to watch people being left to die. That is why an intervention in 20 prisons was inevitable,'' Turk told reporters. Twelve leftist inmates starved themselves to death in 1996 before the government abandoned a similar transfer plan.

This is The World, a co-production of the BBC World Service, PRI and WGBH in Boston. I am Lisa Mullins. For almost 70 years, Mexico's Popocatepetl was dormant. Then in 1994 the giant volcano began to awaken. Last night the alarm went off, Popocatepetl spewed molten rock, thousands of feet into the air, lighting up the sky. Almost everyone living within a four- mile radius of the crater has been evacuated and authorities are working to move thousands more out of the danger zone. The World's Frank Contraris has our story. For days officials had been urging villagers living around the towering volcano to leave their homes. Many of them refused believing that the experts were overreacting. The villagers' skepticism vanished last night, though, when glowing lava and white hot rocks shot from the crater of the volcano for more than an hour. This woman who lives in a village at the foot of the volcano, says it began spewing great amounts of lava. " We were very scared", she adds. So she and her family got in their car and drove down the evacuation route. Hundreds of people had the same idea and traffic jams clogged the roads. The government sent in hundreds of soldiers to aid in the evacuation. Some 20,000 Mexicans are already living in safety shelters and equal number have decided to stay in their villages. In a nationally broadcast address last night, President Vicente Fox tried to calm people's fears. Fox said most of the tiny villages around the 17,000 foot volcano have been evacuated. He added that the government will use emergency funds to create temporary jobs outside the danger zone. That move is designed to give poor farmers an alternative to returning to their tiny cornfields, now covered in volcanic ash. What's next, even volcanologists don't know for sure, but they're monitoring Popocatepetl and for now they report pressure continuing to build inside the dome. For The World, this is Frank Contraris.

Turkey's attempt to regain control of its prisons ended in bloodshed Tuesday, with two soldiers killed while storming the prisons and at least 15 inmates dead _ many from choosing to burn themselves alive rather than surrender. The government, pressing to break up wards controlled by inmates, raided the prisons to prevent some 250 hunger strikers from starving themselves. Inmates linked to outlawed leftist groups launched the hunger strike more than two months ago to protest government plans to transfer them from their wards to new prisons equipped with small cells, where they fear they will be more vulnerable to abuse by authorities. The government says the only way it can regain control of its prisons _ often rocked by riots and hostage takings _ is by breaking up the large wards, which it says political groups run like indoctrination centers. ``From now on the state's sovereignty ... will be realized ... in prisons,'' Justice Minister Hikmet Sami Turk said. After intense fighting, soldiers succeeded in forcing inmates out of the wards in 18 of the 20 prisons they stormed. Armed inmates were still resisting in Istanbul's Umraniye prison and in a prison in the western city of Canakkale. The Interior Ministry said 78 inmates were injured in the clashes, and another 821 inmates on a hunger strike were hospitalized. Turk said the inmates in Istanbul's Bayrampasa prison were armed with AK-47 assault rifles, a claim disputed by Ozgur Tayad, a prisoners' support group. In two prisons, authorities broke through the walls of the wards, and in at least one case soldiers dropped onto a prison roof from helicopters. Turk said 15 inmates died Tuesday, most after setting themselves on fire. Ozgur Tayad said at least eight had been killed by soldiers. One soldier was killed in clashes in Umraniye and another in a prison in Canakkale, Turk said. The government gave no details on how the soldiers died. Ozgur Tayad said the soldiers were killed in cross fire. Turkey's independent Human Rights Association disputed Turk's figures, saying that up to 17 inmates had been killed or committed suicide by setting themselves ablaze, with 12 apparently committing suicide in Bayrampasa alone. Ozgur Tayad said 20 were killed. There was no immediate explanation for the discrepancies. Transfers to the new prisons began after soldiers secured the wards. Across Turkey, hundreds of people were detained for demonstrating against the prison raids. Scores of people were injured in the protests in Istanbul. The government and radical, armed political groups have long been fighting over control of the wards. Last year, 10 leftist inmates were killed when soldiers stormed an Ankara prison to put an end to a riot. Also in 1999, Islamic militants injured 54 soldiers and took more than 100 prison guards hostage to protest plans to move them from their ward. To political prisoners, remaining in the wards is not only a question of protecting themselves from abuse, some analysts say. Human rights groups say that torture is common in Turkish prisons and that leftists and Kurds are often singled out for abuse. Most senior members of leftist organizations such as the Revolutionary People's Liberation Party-Front _ the group that most of the hunger strikers are linked to _ also are in jail and the wards are one of their main sources of power. Prisoners follow party discipline in the wards, and there are even cases of ward leaders killing followers who are not obedient, according to Human Rights Watch. The People's Liberation Party has more than 1,000 followers in prison, a number that some experts say exceeds their membership outside of prison. Dogu Ergil, political sociology professor at Ankara University and an expert on leftist groups, said the inmates' refusal to surrender could also be seen as an attempt by the group to prove that they are still strong. The battle with the soldiers ``is a message to the group that they are very much alive and can continue,'' said Ergil. ``But this is also a sign of desperation because they can do nothing else but annihilate themselves.'' Turkey has pledged to reform its judicial system, including abolishing numerous freedom-curbing laws, in its effort to join the European Union, which accepted Ankara as a candidate last year.

New York-based Human Rights Watch condemned the assault. ``These deaths were entirely avoidable,'' Jonathan Sugden, Turkey researcher for Human Rights Watch, said in a statement released in New York. ``The current crisis in Turkish prisons could have been resolved with patience, transparency and a readiness to consult.'' The government and radical, armed political groups have long been fighting over control of the wards. Last year, 10 leftist inmates were killed when soldiers stormed an Ankara prison to put an end to a riot. Also in 1999, Islamic militants injured 54 soldiers and took more than 100 prison guards hostage to protest plans to move them from their ward. To political prisoners, remaining in the wards is not only a question of protecting themselves from abuse, some analysts say. Human rights groups say that torture is common in Turkish prisons and that leftists and Kurds are often singled out for abuse. Most senior members of leftist organizations such as the Revolutionary People's Liberation Party-Front _ the group that most of the hunger strikers are linked to _ also are in jail and the wards are one of their main sources of power. Prisoners follow party discipline in the wards, and there are even cases of ward leaders killing followers who are not obedient, according to Human Rights Watch. The People's Liberation Party has more than 1,000 followers in prison, a number that some experts say exceeds their membership outside of prison. Dogu Ergil, political sociology professor at Ankara University and an expert on leftist groups, said the inmates' refusal to surrender could also be seen as an attempt by the group to prove that they are still strong. The battle with the soldiers ``is a message to the group that they are very much alive and can continue,'' said Ergil. ``But this is also a sign of desperation because they can do nothing else but annihilate themselves.'' Turkey has pledged to reform its judicial system, including abolishing numerous freedom-curbing laws, in its effort to join the European Union, which accepted Ankara as a candidate last year.

Turkey's attempt to regain control of its prisons ended in bloodshed Tuesday, with two soldiers killed while storming the prisons and at least 15 inmates dead _ many from choosing to burn themselves alive rather than surrender. The government, pressing to break up wards controlled by inmates, raided the prisons to prevent some 250 hunger strikers from starving themselves. Inmates linked to outlawed leftist groups launched the hunger strike more than two months ago to protest government plans to transfer them from their wards to new prisons equipped with small cells, where they fear they will be more vulnerable to abuse by authorities. The government says the only way it can regain control of its prisons _ often rocked by riots and hostage takings _ is by breaking up the large wards, which it says political groups run like indoctrination centers. ``From now on the state's sovereignty ... will be realized ... in prisons,'' Justice Minister Hikmet Sami Turk said. After intense fighting, soldiers succeeded in forcing inmates out of the wards in 18 of the 20 prisons they stormed. Armed inmates were still resisting in Istanbul's Umraniye prison and in a prison in the western city of Canakkale. The Interior Ministry said 78 inmates were injured in the clashes, and another 821 inmates on a hunger strike were hospitalized. Turk said the inmates in Istanbul's Bayrampasa prison were armed with AK-47 assault rifles, a claim disputed by Ozgur Tayad, a prisoners' support group. In two prisons, authorities broke through the walls of the wards, and in at least one case soldiers dropped onto a prison roof from helicopters. Turk said 15 inmates died Tuesday, most after setting themselves on fire. Ozgur Tayad said at least eight had been killed by soldiers. One soldier was killed in clashes in Umraniye and another in a prison in Canakkale, Turk said. The government gave no details on how the soldiers died. Ozgur Tayad said the soldiers were killed in cross fire. Turkey's independent Human Rights Association disputed Turk's figures, saying that up to 17 inmates had been killed or committed suicide by setting themselves ablaze, with 12 apparently committing suicide in Bayrampasa alone. Ozgur Tayad said 20 were killed. There was no immediate explanation for the discrepancies. Transfers to the new prisons began after soldiers secured the wards. Across Turkey, hundreds of people were detained for demonstrating against the prison raids. Scores of people were injured in the protests in Istanbul. New York-based Human Rights Watch condemned the assault. ``These deaths were entirely avoidable,'' Jonathan Sugden, Turkey researcher for Human Rights Watch, said in a statement released in New York. ``The current crisis in Turkish prisons could have been resolved with patience, transparency and a readiness to consult.''

The Security Council voted Tuesday to impose broad sanctions on Afghanistan's Taliban rulers unless they close ``terrorist'' training camps and surrender U.S. embassy bombing suspect Osama bin Laden. The resolution, sponsored by the United States and Russia in a rare show of cooperation, won approval despite opposition from U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan and aid groups. China and Malasia abstained, expressing concern that the new measures would only further harm the Afghan people, already suffering from a 20-year war, poverty and drought. The former rivals over Afghanistan lobbied the 13 other Security Council members hard to adopt the resolution, arguing that the country was a ``haven of lawlessness'' whose hard-line Islamic rulers protect terrorists at home and support terrorism abroad. ``The Taliban leadership harbors the world's most wanted terrorist: Osama bin Laden,'' said deputy U.S. ambassador Nancy Soderberg, stressing that the Saudi exile is but one of many terrorists in the country. ``Let know one misunderstand: They remain a continuing threat to us all.'' The sanctions call for an arms embargo on the Taliban, including foreign military assistance purportedly given the Taliban by Pakistan. The sanctions limit travel by the militia's senior leaders and impose a broader flight ban than the one imposed last year to force bin Laden's surrender. The measures require all Taliban offices overseas to be closed and, in a bid to deprive the Taliban of revenue from illicit opium production, call for a ban on exports to Taliban areas of acetic anhydride, used to manufacture heroin. The sanctions will go into effect in 30 days if Taliban authorities fail to close Afghan ``terrorist'' camps and deliver bin Laden to the United States or another country for trial in the 1998 bombing of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. On Wednesday the Taliban's Information Minister Qadratullah Jamal said the new sanctions won't result in the extradition of bin Laden. ``Our position on Osama is unchanged. There is no evidence against Osama,'' he said. ``The United States and Russia are using the excuse of Osama and terrorism but really it is the Islamic system of the Taliban they want to destroy.'' Taliban leaders also have denied the camps are used to train Chechen rebels, who are fighting for independence from Russia. Taliban officials earlier said they would boycott new U.N.-mediated peace talks if new sanctions are imposed. ``For 21 years, Afghanistan has been burning in the fires of war,'' the Taliban's deputy commerce minister, Faizl Mohammed Faizan, said Tuesday in the Afghan capital, Kabul. ``If the United Nations imposes sanctions, then the United Nations with its own hand is putting people on fire.'' The United Nations withdrew the last of its international staff from Afghanistan on Tuesday, fearing retaliation by Afghans angry the new sanctions will deepen their international isolation. U.N. programs, such as bakeries and clinics, will be run by local staff. ``It is not going to facilitate our peace efforts, nor is it going to facilitate our humanitarian work,'' Annan told an end-of-the-year press conference Tuesday. So far Wednesday it was quiet in Kabul. Jamal said U.N. staff can return anytime and be assured of their safety. ``No one will ransack their offices or bother them. They did not have to leave,'' he said. But ordinary Afghans reacted to the resolution with frustration and anger. ``Why is the United Nations doing this to us?'' 45-year-old Bizmullah Balkhi asked, as he waiting for a bus in Kabul, Afghanistan's capital. ``We have so many problems in this country.'' The wrangling between the Taliban and the United Nations is ``trampling on the hearts and heads of the ordinary people. It does not hurt the Taliban,'' said Gulbaz Khan, a Kabul bus driver. U.S. and Russian officials have said the resolution provides for humanitarian exemptions that mitigate any impact on ordinary Afghans. And they have stressed the resolution is designed to combat terrorism _ not take sides in Afghanistan's civil war as alleged by the Taliban and their Pakistani supporters. But diplomats have suggested that the benefits to the United States and Russia of promoting such a joint initiative when they are so deeply divided over other issues go far beyond the resolution's stated goals of combating terrorism. Cooperation with Russia in Afghanistan can give the United States leverage in oil-rich Central Asia while giving both Moscow and Washington a fresh chance to work together on a sanctions effort, when the Iraqi embargo is crumbling, analysts say.

The International Committee of the Red Cross says it intends to keep its staff in Afghanistan even though the United Nations has withdrawn its foreign workers from the country. Lisa Schlein reports from Geneva. The Red Cross says the Taliban authorities have assured the organization its workers will be safe and there will be no interference with its humanitarian operations. Spokeswoman Antonella Notari says the Red Cross is concerned that the UN sanctions may force private aid agencies to leave the country. She fears this could cripple many essential aid programs. Now the sanctions do make provisions for humanitarian aid to continue. What we are simply following now with great attention is whether humanitarian agencies will remain and continue their operations. Nortary says the support provided by the Red Cross is vital but it is not enough to cover the overwhelming needs. For NPR News, I am Lisa Schlein in Geneva.

This is The World, I am Lisa Mullins. In Turkey, prisoners and security forces have been engaged in a battle for control. The authority seem to have gotten the upper hand but the troubles have not yet ended. Turkish inmates have been staging a nation-wide revolt and hunger strike and two days ago when security forces took action in several jails they met with armed resistance. Sirkan Demirtosh is an editor with the daily newspaper Jimhoriet. Sirkan, this all began when it was announced that Turkish prisons would be remodeled and re-configured because right now they bear no resemblance to prisons here in America. Yes, that is correct. It's a very long lasting problem for Turkey, the prisons, because several times we had some hunger strikes like that in prisons, and then government tries to have a new arrangement for the prisons and for this purpose they appeal to some F type of prisons. So they will be shaped like an F, like the letter F? Yes, three rooms in F style. Three edges of the F, there are one room. That means that only three of the prisoners can see each other. There will be no another kind of reunion or meeting like the current situation in Turkish prisons. In the current situation it is quite different. What you have in some cases are actual dormitories which are almost controlled by the inmates and it's apparently very rare that a prison warden will even enter into those dormitory styled areas. That's correct, let me give you an example. In Inranie prison there are now 450 inmates and resisting to the security forces. They don't let the security forces enter to the dormitories or to the other parts of the prison. In the actual dormitories there are 40 or 50 people or 50 inmates stay together, and when they come together the inmates staying in the dormitory, they are made up, lets say 400 or 450 people, and they are a really strong group. They don't let any control of the security forces in the prison and they don't let security forces enter to the dormitories even. So it would be understandable why inmates don't want to give up that kind of control that they have. What are Human Rights groups saying about this new proposed configuration about how the inmates are being treated now? Well, the Human Rights organizations are against the F type prisons because they don't want to isolate the people from each other, for, let's say, if you are going to be staying in the prison 10 years, it should be unbearable to see only three people in your life. That is why the Human Rights organizations are against and they are doing their protests even on the streets. At the same time all of this is happening there is a very controversial amnesty move. An amnesty that could mean 40,000 inmates will soon be released from prisons to ease overcrowding there. Yes, that's correct. The President approved second proposal of the Parliament about the amnesty law that is to be published in the official newspaper tomorrow. They are going to be all free tomorrow. But the majority of Turkish people are against the amnesty law, because you know, it is not very fair if you are a victim, if you are someone who all the properties are stolen by someone else, you don't want that person to be released. So majority of Turkish people are against of it, but one of the problem of the Turkish prisons such as overcrowded to some extent will be solved. Sirkan Demirtosh is an Editor with the daily newspaper Jimhoriet, speaking to us from Ankara, Turkey. Thank you very much. Thank you very much, Lisa.

President Clinton is expected to act in the next few days on some requests for presidential clemency and pardons he has received from scores of convicted Americans, the White House said Thursday. Among those seeking such presidential intervention are a Wall Street financier, an American Indian activist convicted of killing two FBI agents and a longtime Arkansas friend involved in the Whitewater probe. The president likely will act before Christmas, said White House press secretary Jake Siewert. ``But I don't think that will be the end of it,'' he added. ``I think he is going to try to review as many of these as he can, and I expect that there will be, in some sense, a rolling process that continues right up until the end of his term.'' Asked whether convicted Israeli spy Jonathan Pollard was on the list, Siewert replied: ``I wouldn't expect anything new on that.'' The administration has been reviewing Israel's request that Pollard be released. The former civilian analyst for the U.S. Navy was convicted of espionage in 1985 for giving Israel tens of thousands of top-secret documents. He was sentenced to life in prison. Earlier this week, a coalition of 675 clergy asked Clinton to commute sentences of nonviolent drug offenders. In a letter, the group asked the president to grant clemency and release on supervised parole those federal prisoners who have served at least five years for low-level, nonviolent involvement in drug cases. ``To find some of those drug offenders who deserve to be released, Clinton should appeal to the more than 600 federal trial judges, asking each to name at least one defendant whom he or she was required by mandatory sentencing laws to sentence to a term he or she thought was unjust _ the kind of cases that the judges lost sleep over,'' said Chap Thevenot, coalition coordinator. Among others who have asked Clinton for clemency: _Leonard Peltier, convicted of killing FBI agents Ron Williams and Jack Koler who were searching for robbery suspects on the Pine Ridge Indian reservation in South Dakota in June 1975. He was convicted and sentenced in 1977. The defense contended that evidence against him was falsified. _Susan McDougal, a former real estate business partner of the Clintons who was sentenced in 1996 and released from prison in 1998. She was convicted of four felonies related to a fraudulent $300,000 federally backed loan that she and her husband, failed savings and loan owner James McDougal, never repaid. About $30,000 of the loan was used as a down payment on property briefly placed in the name of Whitewater Development, the Arkansas real estate venture of the Clintons and McDougals. _Michael Milken, who made billions for himself and others in the 1980s junk bond business, was convicted of securities fraud, served 22 months of a 10-year sentence and paid over $1 billion in fines, restitution and legal settlements. Milken's pardon request is backed by one of Clinton's original benefactors, California supermarket mogul Ron Burkle. _Archie Schaffer III, a Tyson Foods executive convicted under a 1907 law of trying to influence agricultural policy by arranging for then-Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy to attend a Tyson birthday party in Arkansas in 1993.

America's protracted election, the tug-of-war over Elian Gonzalez and the terrorist bombing of the USS Cole ranked as the top news stories of 2000, according to The Associated Press annual survey of its members. No. 1 was no contest: George W. Bush's nail-biting triumph in Florida in an extraordinary presidential race resolved by the nation's highest court five weeks after Election Day. The story received a first-place ranking from 281 of the 312 AP newspaper and broadcast members who took part in the news cooperative's survey. AP members also turned to Florida for the No. 2 story: The bitter custody battle with political overtones that centered on whether young Elian Gonzalez, rescued from the sea while fleeing Cuba with his mother, should stay with relatives in Miami or be returned to his father. Following in the rankings were the attack on the USS Cole that killed 17 sailors, soaring oil prices that sent prices at the pump sharply upward, and the recall of more than 6 million Firestone tires. AP subscribers outside the United States offered a different take on the year's news. Fifty overseas subscribers, in a separate poll, also chose the U.S. presidential battle as the top story. But they ranked the ouster of Yugoslavia's Slobodan Milosevic second, followed by Israeli-Palestinian violence. Next were the Aug. 12 disaster aboard the Russian nuclear submarine Kursk and the historic summit between leaders of the two Koreas. U.S. editors ranked Milosevic's toppling No. 9, the Middle East conflict No. 11, and the Russian sub tragedy No. 12. They did not place the Koreas summit among the top 20 stories _ ranking it lower than the 2000 Olympic Games and Tiger Woods' three Grand Slam wins. This was the 65th year that the AP polled its members. A first-place vote gave a story 10 points, a second-place vote nine points, and so on. The top story last year was President Clinton's impeachment trial. ___ Here are the top 10 stories of 2000 as ranked by AP members: 1) The presidential election: George W. Bush emerged the winner in an overtime election that took unprecedented legal and political twists. 2) Tug-of-war over Elian Gonzalez: After months of political and legal wrangling, armed federal agents seized the 6-year-old boy from his Miami relatives, and he was ultimately returned him to his father in Cuba. 3) USS Cole attack: Seventeen U.S. sailors died Oct. 12 when explosives transported in a small boat ripped open the hull of the 505-foot destroyer in Yemen. 4) Oil prices: Crude oil prices soared as OPEC curtailed production, leading to a worldwide outcry over higher fuel costs and prompting the United States to dip into its strategic reserves. 5) Firestone's troubles: The tire maker recalled more than 6 million tires after complaints of tread separations, blowouts and other problems that led to accidents. The federal government has linked 148 deaths and hundreds of injuries to the tires. 6) Microsoft breakup: A federal judge ordered Microsoft Corp. to split up in an antitrust case that, if upheld, could result in the largest government-ordered restructuring since AT&AMP;T's breakup in 1984. 7) Genetic code mapped: New medical frontiers opened when scientists announced that they had virtually deciphered the human genetic code. 8) The Year 2000: The new year arrived mostly glitch-free, with millennium celebrations drowning out doomsday predictions of Y2K computer problems. 9) Milosevic toppled: Following a disputed election, the 13-year rule of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic ended abruptly when thousands of people stormed parliament and forced him to hand power to rival Vojislav Kostunica. 10) Tobacco verdict: A jury ordered the tobacco industry to pay a record $145 billion in punitive damages to sick Florida smokers; tobacco lawyers warned that the verdict, if upheld, could bankrupt the industry. ___ The top news stories of 2000 as chosen by 312 Associated Press newspaper and broadcast editors in the United States. A first-place vote gave the story 10 points, a second-place vote nine points, and so on. Stories are followed by the number of points they received. 1. Presidential election; 2,997. 2. Elian Gonzalez custody dispute; 1,549. 3. USS Cole bombing; 1,187. 4. Soaring oil prices; 1,063. 5. Firestone tire recall; 1,021. 6. Microsoft breakup ordered; 877. 7. Genetic code mapped; 854. 8. Year 2000 arrives; 710. 9. Milosevic toppled in Yugoslavia; 540. 10. Verdict against tobacco industry, 512. ___ The top 10 rankings by AP subscribers outside the United States: 1) U.S. presidential election 2) Milosevic toppled in Yugoslavia 3) Violence threatens Middle East peace process 4) Explosion sinks Russian nuclear submarine Kursk 5) South Korea-North Korea summit 6) Genetic code mapped 7) Russia elects Vladimir Putin as president 8) Concorde jet crashes in France 9) Soaring oil prices 10) Olympic Games

Soldiers bombarded defiant inmates with tear gas Friday, forcing 430 to surrender and ending a four-day crackdown on prisons that left at least 24 prisoners and two soldiers dead. The inmates at Istanbul's Umraniye prison had been the last to hold out after some 5,000 soldiers stormed 20 prisons on Tuesday. The crackdown aimed to impose control on prison wards where left-wing inmates were holding a hunger strike. After days of firing tear gas into the facility to little effect, soldiers intensified their assault Friday. They cut holes in the roof and lobbed in so many gas canisters that at least 19 ambulances were needed to evacuate soldiers and inmates suffering from gas inhalation. Justice Minister Hikmet Sami Turk said three inmates were killed during clashes Friday in Umraniye and that a total of 24 inmates, most of whom set themselves ablaze, died in the four days of confrontations. ``I hope these kinds of madness will not recur,'' Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit said. Earlier in the day, there were reports that 26 inmates had been killed, but Justice Ministry officials said the higher toll was the result of some bodies being counted twice. Private NTV television said at least 50 inmates were injured in Friday's clashes. Ozgur Tayad, a prisoners' support group, said the death toll was much higher but gave no figures. Most of the inmates set themselves ablaze and burned to death rather than surrender. At least five of the bodies bore gunshots, an autopsy report revealed. Inmates in Turkey's prison had launched a hunger strike two months ago to protest government plans to move them from dormitory-style wards to prisons with smaller cells, where inmates say they will be more vulnerable to abuse. The government had said it was vital to regain control of the prisons, where left-wing, Kurdish and Islamic groups often run their wards like political indoctrination centers, barring guards from entry and smuggling in weapons, mobile phones, fax machines and laptop computers with internet access. The prisons are also overcrowded, with wards housing up to 100 people. Soldiers have been lobbing tear gas canisters into Umraniye prison for four days before intensifying their assault Friday. Some inmates were reportedly wearing makeshift gas masks. Hundreds of soldiers, some holding plastic riot shields, surrounded Umraniye on Friday. During the night, smoke billowed from the prison as inmates inside set fire to mattresses and blankets, resisting calls to surrender. A day earlier, inmates had vowed to fight until ``death or victory.'' On Thursday, 158 inmates at Canakkale prison surrendered. Prisoners at the 18 other prisons were overwhelmed by soldiers or surrendered on Tuesday. The government said an amnesty law that went into force Friday would set free some 35,000 inmates and help authorities divide wards into one- or three-person cells. Authorities began releasing hundreds of prisoners on Friday. The amnesty does not apply to prisoners who opposed the state, such as Islamic, Kurdish or leftist militants. Many of the leftist inmates are linked to the Revolutionary People's Liberation Army-Front, a group that aims to establish a Marxist republic in Turkey. The group has claimed responsibility for the assassinations of generals, policemen and government officials and has targeted U.S. military and diplomatic missions.

In the first batch of pardons of his final holiday season in the White House, President Clinton Friday pardoned 59 people including Dan Rostenkowski, the once-powerful chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, a man whose conviction exemplified the passing of an old-fashioned style of leadership in Congress. Rostenkowski, who was reared by the Chicago Democratic political machine, brought to Congress a mastery of the game of legislation with its premium on brokering, bluffing, and figuring out the compromise that gives the little required but gets a bit more in return. He served 15 months in prison and two months in a halfway house after pleading guilty to two counts of mail fraud in 1996. He also paid a $100,000 fine. Although Rostenkowski pleaded guilty, he always dismissed his offenses as merely giving away ashtrays and chairs and hiring the children of his friends. While he was held in disdain by some younger, reform-minded members of Congress, many admired him for his ability to get things accomplished. He spent most of his 36 years in the House as either a member or the chairman of its most powerful committee while it engaged in legislative feats like the creation of Medicare and the 1986 overhaul of the tax code. Included in the president's pardon list were some other notable choices, including commutations of sentences for two women jailed on drug charges who had received longer sentences for their involvement than the people who ran the operations. The two women, Kemba Smith, 28, of Richmond, Va., and Dorothy Gaines, 42, of Mobile, Ala., have been the object of campaigns by opponents of mandatory minimum sentences imposed by Congress. Smith was sentenced to 24 years and six months in prison with no chance of parole for helping her boyfriend, the head of a violent drug ring, and Gaines received 19 years, seven months for her low-level role in a different drug ring. They may now be freed within days. Also pardoned was Archibald R. Schaffer 3rd, a longtime friend of President and Hillary Rodham Clinton from Arkansas. Schaffer, an executive with Tyson Foods, was sentenced in September to a year in prison for his role in a scheme to illegally influence Mike Espy, the former agriculture secretary. Schaffer, who was the director of government and media relations for Tyson, the large poultry and food processing company, was convicted of giving Espy $2,500 worth of air transportation so he could attend a May 1993 party in Arkansas hosted by Tyson executives. Prosecutors argued that the gift was aimed at influencing Espy to relax regulations aimed at promoting safe meat handling. The trial judge, James Robertson, said that Schaffer's role in the Espy visit was so minor he did not want to impose a prison sentence but was obliged to by the Meat Inspection Act, a statute that set a one-year minimum sentence for its violation. What was unusual in the pardon of Schaffer was that he had not yet served any of his sentence. Margaret C. Love, the former pardon attorney in the Justice Department, a nonpartisan post, and an authority on the pardon power, said it would have been customary in such a circumstance to provide a commutation of sentence. In those rare instances in which a pardon is given for a sentence not yet served, she said, it usually signifies that the president disagrees with the conviction. As an example, she cited the Christmas season pardons by President Bush in 1992 of six people convicted in the Iran-contra affair. White House officials said that Friday's list was probably not the last word on presidential pardons as Clinton exits the White House. Although Schaffer was an Arkansas associate of the Clintons, he was convicted in an investigation peripheral to Whitewater, the six-year-long investigation of the Clintons involving transactions in Arkansas. Among those who are still being considered for pardons, administration officials said, are several people associated with the Whitewater investigation including Webster Hubbell and Susan McDougal, both Arkansas friends of the Clintons. Hubbell, once the No. 3 person in the Clinton Justice Department, was convicted of defrauding his law firm, and McDougal was convicted of fraudulently obtaining a $300,000 loan, part of which prosecutors said was used to pay expenses of the Whitewater real estate venture with the Clintons. The president is also considering requests for a pardon from Michael Milken, who was once the leading figure in marketing junk bonds and was convicted of six felonies. Milken has mounted an aggressive campaign to obtain a pardon. Among those pardoned Friday were Peter Bailey Gimbel of New York, who was convicted on a cocaine distribution charge, and Philip J. Grandmaison, a Democratic Party operative in New Hampshire who was a Clinton delegate in 1992 and was convicted in a local bribery scheme.

Turkish troops have forced an end to the last remnants of a prison revolt. The last of some 400 inmates surrendered Friday at Istanbul's Unraniye prison after security forces began lobbying teargas grenades into their compound. The fight for control of Turkey's prisons began Tuesday when paramilitary forces stormed twenty jails across the nation. As Ember Inzaman reports from Ankara, government forces had to fight the inmates and bad weather. Snowstorms slowed down Turkish troops Friday as they fought to gain control of the Unraniye prison in Istanbul, where more than four hundred armed inmates were battling government forces. But the firepower from hundreds of Turkish troops proved overwhelming and the inmates surrendered. At least 26 people, 24 inmates and two soldiers have died in the operation so far. Turkish authorities say most of the inmates perished after setting themselves on fire, but some inmates recovering from burns in hospitals, were quoted in Turkish dailies as saying they were set on fire by attacking troops. Human rights groups in Turkey and elsewhere are calling for an immediate investigation of the raids. They say an independent commission should be setup to carry out the investigation. Turkish Interior Minister Sadeqjin Tomtam says he will give the media a full briefing on Saturday on the details of the operation which Turkish authorities call Return to Life. The operation began four days ago when government forces stormed twenty prisons in a bid to end the two month old hunger strike by more than one thousand prisoners. The prisoners, most of whom are linked to Left Wing groups, began the strikes to protest government plan to transfer them to new maximum security jails. The prisoners are fighting the transfers saying the new more private facilities will make them vulnerable to greater abuse by prison guards. Turkish authorities say the transfers are necessary to make it more difficult for criminal gangs and extremist factions in prisons to exert control over inmates. Riots and hostage taking are frequent occurrences in many of the prisons targeted by the government, where as many as a hundred inmates are held in each ward. Most of the prisoners taken in the raids are being transferred to the new maximum security jail. Ember Inzaman for VOA News, Ankara.

The exiled Chinese writer who won this year's Nobel Prize for literature will make a three-day visit to Hong Kong next month at the invitation of two local universities, a university spokeswoman said Saturday. Gao Xingjian, who has lived in France since fleeing China in 1987, will arrive in Hong Kong on Jan. 29 and will lecture at the Chinese University of Hong Kong and the City University of Hong Kong, said Chinese University spokeswoman Nancy Kuo. Although Gao's works are banned in China, he was not expected to have problems gaining entry into Hong Kong as a French passport holder. Hong Kong was returned to China's sovereignty in 1997, but it has retained a relatively high level of autonomy and has different immigration rules from mainland China. Gao, who spent five years at hard labor during the Cultural Revolution, is the first-ever Chinese winner of the Nobel Prize for literature. The award was sternly criticized by China's Foreign Ministry as a political maneuver. Gao is little known in China, and the Chinese state media did not mention the award when he won.

A US official says Islamic terrorists planned multiple attacks on US and Jordanian targets last January. Richard Clark, the Clinton administration's Counter-terrorism Chief, told the Washington Post the plan included multiple bombings in Jordan and the United States and the sinking of a US Navy destroyer in Yemen. Mr. Clark says the attacks were meant to take place last January 3rd amid millennial celebrations and the Muslim observance of Ramadan. He says the attacks either failed or were thwarted by arrests, but terrorists succeeded in bombing a US ship in Yemen in October. Mr. Clark says US officials learnt details of the planned attacks during the interrogation of suspected terrorists with links to exiled Saudi millionaire, Osama Bin Laden.

Bombs exploded outside churches in Jakarta and five other Indonesian cities and towns on Christmas Eve, killing at least 14 people, injuring dozens and worsening the already difficult relations between Muslims and Christians throughout the fractured archipelago. The blasts, including one outside Jakarta's main Roman Catholic church near the presidential palace and the main mosque, happened as prayer services were about to get under way Sunday night. The explosions set cars ablaze and damaged some churches. President Abdurrahman Wahid on Monday asked Christians not to be provoked and blamed the attacks on forces intent on ``destabilizing the government.'' In the past Wahid has accused supporters of ex-dictator Suharto of using violence to create political uncertainty. ``There is an effort to use the name of Islam to destroy Christians or to use the name of Christianity to destroy Muslims,'' Wahid said, vowing to press forward with democratic reforms. About 20 bombs exploded outside churches in Jakarta and five other Indonesian cities and towns, killing at least 14 people and injuring 47, said National Police Chief Gen. Bimantoro, who like many Indonesians uses only one name. There were no immediate claims of responsibility, but religious violence and tensions have been rising throughout this predominantly Muslim country. Although most of the violence has taken place in the Moluccan islands, Muslim vigilante groups have recently attacked restaurants and nightclubs in Jakarta, the capital. Wahid, himself a Muslim scholar, has advocated religious tolerance, but Sunday's attacks add to a long list of crises and acts of violence that have worsened during his 14-month rule. Five Catholic and Protestant churches were targeted in Jakarta, where three people were killed, including a man who died in an explosion at a bus stop outside a church and adjacent Christian school, police said. The Jakarta bombs exploded within an hour and a radius of about a mile. The bomb that exploded near the Roman Catholic Cathedral, thought to have been planted in a parked car, left worshippers shaken. ``I was in the cathedral with my wife and two children. I heard the explosion. I am very worried that there will be religious fighting everywhere,'' said Winarno, who also goes by only one name. An unexploded bomb was also discovered near the cathedral, where hundreds of Christians were arriving ahead of midnight Mass as thousands of Muslims were leaving the nearby mosque at the end of Islamic evening prayers. Other churches were evacuated after receiving threats. ``This is clearly the work of people who are determined to make trouble and to bring about clashes among people,'' Jakarta police spokesman Superintendent Anton Bahrulalam said. ``We will be on full alert when people come to pray on Christmas Day.'' There were four explosions outside one church in the exclusive Jakarta suburb of Menteng, police said. Four of the dead Sunday were police officers who tried to disarm a bomb in Pekanbaru on Sumatra island, the official Antara news agency said. One civilian was also killed there. Antara reported blasts outside of churches in Medan on Sumatra island. Police there later found nine unexploded bombs. Two people were killed in a blast at a Christian-owned house in Bandung west Java, Indonesia's main island, police said. Bimantoro on Monday did not give details on the other four deaths. On Batam island, not far from neighboring Singapore, three blasts injured 22 people, it said. Explosions rocked three churches in the town of Mojokerto in the east Java. Bombs also went off near three churches in Mataram on the tourist island of Lombok. The Christmas celebrations coincide with the final days of Ramadan, Islam's month of fasting, which ends Tuesday. Sunday's attacks follow a rise in Muslim extremism throughout the country. The heaviest violence has been in the Moluccan or Maluku islands in Indonesia's east, where an estimated 5,000 people of both faiths have been killed over the past two years. Christians make up less than 10 percent of Indonesia's 210 million people. Many are from the ethnic Chinese minority, which has been targeted by Muslim groups during past civil unrest. Sunday's bombings were the latest in a series to rock the capital. The worst this year came in September, when a car bomb and subsequent fire killed 15 people in a basement parking lot at Jakarta's Stock Exchange. In August, two people were killed when a car bomb blew up outside the Philippine ambassador's home. Authorities made arrests after those attacks and several smaller explosions, but have filed no formal charges. Most of the suspects have been released.

After a coordinated series of bombings outside churches on Christmas Eve killed at least 13 people, Indonesia's president accused his opponents Monday of trying to whip up religious hatred in the mainly Muslim nation. Christmas day, some churches were only half full as many stayed away fearing new attacks, and police searched worshippers' bags as they entered services Monday. The explosions came just before services Sunday night outside churches in Jakarta and eight other cities and towns. At least 13 people were killed and nearly 100 injured in 15 blasts, said National Police spokesman Brig. Gen. Saleh Saaf, revising an earlier count of 15 dead by other officials. The bombs contained TNT and exploded within minutes of each other in what appeared to be an organized terror campaign, he said. Most of the bombs were planted in cars parked outside targeted churches _ including Jakarta's Roman Catholic cathedral, near the presidential palace and the capital's main mosque. Clergymen received others wrapped as gifts. Police defused 13 unexploded devices. No one claimed responsibility for the attacks, which coincided with the final days of Ramadan, the Muslim holy month. There were fears that outraged Christians might retaliate against Muslims at the start of the feast of Eid al-Fitr on Tuesday night. ``Even if we know who is behind the bombings, I urge all Christians to forgive,'' Indonesia's Catholic Cardinal Julius Darmaatmadja said Monday. President Abdurrahman Wahid, a respected Muslim leader, called for calm and asked Christians not to be provoked by forces intent on ``destabilizing the government and creating fear and panic so that the government can not work.'' ``There is an effort to use the name of Islam to destroy Christians or to use the name of Christianity to destroy Muslims,'' Wahid said before leaving Jakarta on a visit to the remote Irian Jaya province. In the past, Wahid has accused supporters of ex-dictator Suharto of using violence to create political uncertainty. ``This is the last breath of those who fear that if the government can remain stable we will enter a new era, an era of economic awakening and democracy,'' he said of Sunday's bombings. Police said 48 people were being questioned nationwide, including 16 men in relation to a possible bomb factory in Bandung in the western part of Java, Indonesia's main island. Nobody has been charged or named as a suspect. In a statement, Laskar Jihad, a Muslim paramilitary group accused of past sectarian violence, denied involvement and said the bombings were ``immoral and politically motivated.'' Another group, the Islamic Defenders' Front also denied links to the bombings. The attacks added to a long list of crises that have worsened during Wahid's 14-month rule, which ended years of authoritarianism. Parts of the sprawling archipelago nation are wracked by separatist and religious violence. Most of Indonesia's religious violence has been in the Moluccan islands, where about 5,000 Christians and Muslims have been killed over the past two years. However, Muslim vigilante groups that have mushroomed in recent months have attacked restaurants and nightclubs in Jakarta and elsewhere, and sectarian fighting has flared in other places. Five Catholic and Protestant churches were targeted Sunday in Jakarta, where three people were killed. The bombs exploded within an area with a one-mile radius. A car outside one church exploded in smoke and flames, shattering car windows nearby and causing panic, according to an Associated Press Television News cameraman who saw the blast. The explosion near the Roman Catholic cathedral left worshippers shaken. ``I am very worried that there will be religious fighting everywhere,'' said Winarno, who like many Indonesians goes by only one name. An unexploded bomb was also discovered near the cathedral as hundreds of Christians were arriving for midnight Mass and thousands of Muslims were leaving the nearby mosque after Islamic evening prayers. Four of the dead were police officers who had tried to disarm a bomb in Pekanbaru on Sumatra island, the official Antara news agency said. Blasts were reported at churches in Bekasi, Surabaya, Sukabumi, Mojokerto and Bandung on Java as well as on Batam island, not far from Singapore, and Mataram, on the tourist island of Lombok. Eleven unexploded bombs were found in Medan on Sumatra. Less than 10 percent of Indonesia's 210 million people are Christians. Many are from the ethnic Chinese minority, which has been targeted by Muslim groups during past civil unrest. In September, a car bomb and fire killed 15 people at Jakarta's Stock Exchange.

A police officer was shot and killed as he responded to a robbery at a sporting goods store that had just closed on Christmas Eve, authorities said. Several employees were in the store at the time, but no one was injured, police said. No customers were in the store. About 30 minutes after the Oshman's store closed Sunday, police got a call about a robbery in progress there, police spokesman Lt. David Tull said. Three officers responded to the call. One of the officers was shot when he confronted three men at the back of the store. Police identified the officer as 29-year-old Aubry Hawkins, who had been with the department since October 1999. Police said the robbers fled after herding the employees into a corner of the store. Late Sunday night, police questioned the employees at police headquarters. Lou Morris, whose son Andrew is a cashier at the store, said she arrived at the store at 8 p.m. to find crime tape and police cars around the building. ``I talked to Andrew earlier in the day, and he said he'd be home about 6:30. When it got to be 7 or 7:30 I started to get worried,'' she told the Dallas Morning News. Police were looking for three men seen leaving in a 1996 white Ford Explorer that was stolen from a store employee.

After a coordinated series of bombings outside churches on Christmas Eve killed at least 13 people, Indonesia's president accused his opponents Monday of whipping up religious hatred in the mainly Muslim nation. On Christmas day, some churches were half-empty as many stayed away fearing new attacks, and police searched worshippers' bags as they entered services Monday. Top security minister Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono blamed ``well-organized terrorists'' for the blasts and said police intelligence reports warned of more bombings planned in places of worship and public buildings. He did not elaborate. The explosions came just before services Sunday night outside churches in Jakarta and eight other cities and towns. The bombs contained TNT and exploded within minutes of each other. At least 13 people were killed and nearly 100 injured in 15 blasts, said National Police spokesman Brig. Gen. Saleh Saaf, revising an earlier count of 15 dead by other officials. Most of the bombs were planted in cars parked outside churches including Jakarta's Roman Catholic cathedral, near the presidential palace and the capital's main mosque. Clergymen received others wrapped as gifts. Police defused 13 devices. A police intelligence official, Gen. Sutiyono Ansyaad, said two men were arrested on suspicion of involvement in an alleged bomb factory in Bandung, in the western part of Java, Indonesia's main island. He said detonators were found there. Police said another 48 people were being questioned nationwide. No one claimed responsibility for the attacks, which coincided with the final days of Ramadan, the Muslim holy month. There were fears that outraged Christians might retaliate against Muslims at the start of the feast of Eid al-Fitr on Tuesday night. ``Even if we know who is behind the bombings, I urge all Christians to forgive,'' Indonesia's Catholic Cardinal Julius Darmaatmadja said Monday.

In the past, Wahid has accused supporters of ex-dictator Suharto, some hard-liners in the military and Muslim extremists of using terrorism to create political uncertainty. Yudhoyono, a retired army general, said there was nothing to suggest military involvement. Laskar Jihad and the Islamic Defenders' Front, two Muslim paramilitary groups accused of past sectarian violence, denied involvement. The attacks added to a long list of crises that have worsened during Wahid's 14-month rule, which ended years of authoritarianism.

LONDON (AP) _ NATO troops at Mass in Bosnia and Orthodox Christians in the candlelit splendor of Istanbul's cathedral kept the flames of hope and peace burning on Christmas Day, while in the birthplace of Jesus much of the season's joy was lost in the sorrow of Israeli-Palestinian violence. In Indonesia, after a spate of fatal church bombings on Christmas Eve, many Christians stayed away from services on Monday for fear of renewed attacks. Although no one in the mostly Muslim nation claimed responsibility, President Abdurrahman Wahid blamed forces he said were intent on destabilizing the country. The Catholic Church tried to ease the volatile situation after 15 were killed and nearly 100 people were injured. ``Even if we know who is behind the bombings, I urge all Christians to forgive,'' Indonesian Cardinal Julius Darmaatmadja said Monday. A weary Pope John Paul II was dismayed by the attacks in Indonesia, where, he said, ``our brothers and sisters in faith, even on this Christmas Day, are undergoing a tragic time of trial and suffering.'' In his traditional Christmas Day message ``Urbi et Orbi'' (Latin for ``to the city and to the world''), the 80-year-old pontiff lamented the ``endless streams'' of refugees from conflicts around the world and spoke particularly of the Middle East, where ``violence continues to stain with blood the difficult path to peace.'' In the West Bank town of Bethlehem, revered by Christians as the birthplace of Jesus, the Christmas sprit of the past _ and the tourism of the present _ were subdued by the lingering animosity of three months of Palestinian-Israeli violence. At least 345 people have been killed, most of them Palestinians. The oppressive atmosphere was not lightened by Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein, who called on Christians and Muslims around the world to wage holy war against Israel. His message appeared on the front page of every newspaper in Baghdad. About 1,000 miles away, in Istanbul, a more joyous celebration took place. The leaders of 13 Orthodox Christian churches gathered at the city's Byzantine cathedral to observe Christmas together for the first time in their history, as a culmination of festivities marking the 2,000th anniversary of Christ's birth. Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I, in vestments of brocade and gold, led the two-hour service in ornate surroundings as throngs of the faithful crowded the aisles to film with video cameras. Bartholomew said his church has shown its ``concern for the natural environment as well as for peaceful resolution among peoples, nations and various churches.'' Secular leaders, too, expressed their concerns and appealed to the best in their citizens. Sweden's King Carl XVI Gustaf said he was disappointed by the failure of the world climate talks last month in the Netherlands. ``This is worrying, especially considering that many scientists, already today, see more and more consequences of man's irresponsible behavior with, for example, a poisoned environment, climate changes and degenerative illnesses as a result,'' he said. Queen Elizabeth II told a vast audience on television, radio and the Internet that the teachings of Jesus were part of the framework of her own life, and said many others had been inspired by Jesus' simple but powerful teaching to ``treat others as you would like them to treat you.'' In a traditional Christmas Eve message, Belgium's King Albert II warned his country against racism and xenophobia, issues that have gained attention since the electoral success three months ago of a Flemish nationalist party opposed to immigration. The king also spoke of his recent visit to Belgian peacekeeping troops in the Balkans, saying he was ``horrified by the ravages caused in our times and on our continent by extreme nationalism and xenophobia.'' King Albert also used his speech to pay homage to Belgian peacekeepers in the Balkans. For thousands of NATO troops in Bosnia, Christmas this year meant being far from their families. Christmas trees and colored lights decorated the U.S. barracks Eagle base in northern Bosnia. Near Mostar, southern Bosnia, soldiers from France, Spain, Italy and Portugal held a dinner, attended Mass and sang songs from all their nations. At Camp Bondsteel in the Yugoslav province of Kosovo, members of the 4,500-strong U.S. contingent were missing their loved ones. ``I wish I was home for the holidays, but what can you do?'' said 28-year-old Capt. Brook Maynelt of Illinois. ``There's a job to be done.''

Seven escaped convicts made good on a threat they made while breaking out of prison nearly two weeks ago, police said. ``You haven't heard the last of us yet'' read a note the men left when fleeing the Connally Unit in Kenedy on Dec. 13, said John McAuliffe, inspector general of the Texas Department of Criminal Justice. The men are suspected in the shooting death of Officer Aubry Hawkins, 29, who attempted to break up a Christmas Eve robbery at an Oshman's sporting goods. ``It certainly will be a Christmas to remember and for all the wrong reasons,'' said Jimmy Perdue, Irving's assistant police chief. Investigators have filed capital murder warrants against the seven escaped convicts who early Tuesday remained at large. Two dozen employees herded to the back of the store during the holdup helped identify the suspects, said Chief Lowell Cannaday. By Monday night, a makeshift memorial had taken shape at the sports store, closed in honor of the fallen officer. Outside, potted plants were left by the door and a large red ribbon adorned a bicycle rack. Hawkins' weapon has not been found since Sunday's incident. Police spokesman David Tull said he didn't know if the robbers took any weapons or ammunition from the store. The alleged robbers were accused of stealing an employee's white Ford Explorer to escape. The vehicle was found in Irving. It is unknown how they escaped afterward. In the prison break, the convicts took 14 .357 Magnum pistols with 238 rounds of ammunition, a loaded automatic rifle and a loaded shotgun that they stole from a guard tower. Larry Fitzgerald, spokesman for the Texas Department of Criminal Justice, said it is unusual that the suspects have remained together since their escape. ``These are desperate and dangerous people,'' Fitzgerald said. The prison at Kenedy is 65 miles southeast of San Antonio and more than 300 from Irving. ___ On the Net: Irving Police Department: http://www.irvingpd.com/ Texas Criminal Department of Criminal Justice: http://www.tdcj.state.tx.us/

Seven escaped convicts may have carried out a threat they made when they broke out of prison nearly two weeks ago, police said. ``You haven't heard the last of us yet,'' read a note the men left when fleeing the Connally Unit in Kenedy on Dec. 13, said John McAuliffe, inspector general of the Texas Department of Criminal Justice. Now, the men are suspected in the shooting death of Officer Aubry Hawkins, 29, who attempted to break up a Christmas Eve robbery at an Oshman's sporting goods. ``It certainly will be a Christmas to remember and for all the wrong reasons,'' said Jimmy Perdue, Irving's assistant police chief.

It is unusual that the suspects have remained together since their escape, said Larry Fitzgerald, spokesman for the Texas Department of Criminal Justice. ``These are desperate and dangerous people,'' Fitzgerald said. The prison, 65 miles southeast of San Antonio and more than 300 from Irving, has a capacity of 2,834 male prisoners. It opened in July 1995 and has 550 security personnel. The escape was the prison's fourth inmate uprising this year. In April, eight prisoners assaulted three officers, inflicting minor injuries, and in June an inmate severely beat a corrections officer. Also in June, another officer suffered minor injuries when she was stabbed six times by an inmate carrying a sharpened metal rod. ___ On the Net: Irving Police Department: http://www.irvingpd.com/ Texas Criminal Department of Criminal Justice: http://www.tdcj.state.tx.us/

Houses of worship were tightly guarded Tuesday after a deadly Christmas Eve church bombing campaign, and officials asked Muslims to mark the end of the month-long Ramadan fast without the usual rowdy celebrations. Thousands of security personnel were in the streets in Jakarta and throughout the world's largest Islamic country, two days after explosions at churches in nine cities and towns killed 15 people and injured about 100. ``We are on alert. Worshippers are now targets for attack,'' said a Jakarta Police spokesman, Supt. Anton Bachrul Alam. Amid fears the bombings could fuel a cycle of religious violence, about 14,000 police and soldiers had been ordered to guard churches and mosques and patrol trouble-prone parts of the city, the spokesman said. On Monday, police arrested two men accused of operating a makeshift bomb factory in Bandung, 80 miles southeast of Jakarta on Java, the nation's main island. A device they were assembling blew up prematurely, killing three others, police said. Dozens of people have been detained for questioning elsewhere, including more than 20 in Jakarta, police said. Tens of thousands of people were expected to gather in Jakarta Tuesday night at a prayer service, where President Abdurrahman Wahid was scheduled to declare the end of the Islamic fasting month of Ramadan and start of the two-day feast of Eid al-Fitr. But Wahid's participation in the ceremony was canceled Tuesday. Officials gave no reason for the decision. Eid al-Fitr is usually a boisterous affair in Indonesia, where 90 percent of the nation's 210 million people are Muslims. Thousands bang drums and set off fireworks, and traffic chokes the streets. But in a television address on Tuesday, Jakarta Gov. Sutiyoso asked the city's 11 million people not to stage traditional street parades because of security fears. Jakarta's police chief also called on Muslims to stay at home. No one has claimed responsibility for the Christmas Eve attacks. Many of the bombs were placed in cars outside churches, and all detonated at the same time of day. Several militant Islamic groups and separatist fighters in the restive northwestern province of Aceh have denied involvement in the bombings. Wahid, a respected Muslim leader and advocate of religious tolerance, has called for calm and has labeled the explosions ``acts of terrorism'' aimed to destabilize his government. He said provocateurs want to generate violence among people of different faiths in a bid to oust him and stymie his democratic reform agenda. Wahid came to office 14 months ago promising sweeping changes after decades of authoritarian rule, mostly under the former dictator Suharto. However, his inability to fix the economy and quell bloody unrest in outlying provinces has prompted calls for his resignation. He has also been implicated in several political scandals. Members of Indonesia's Christian minority, many of whom are ethnic Chinese, have been sometimes targeted during civil unrest. Among the Jakarta neighborhoods under heavy guard Tuesday was the city's Chinatown, the police spokesman said. Christian leaders have urged their followers not to seek revenge against Muslims over the bombings, which came at the end of a year of rising separatist and sectarian violence across the archipelago nation. Last week some church officials in Indonesia's troubled Moluccan islands accused Islamic gangs of forcing dozens of Christians to convert to Islam at gunpoint. Fighting there and in the Aceh province on Sumatra island, where Islam-inspired separatists have been battling the government for years, has claimed thousands of lives this year. A separatist movement has also grown in the mainly Christian Irian Jaya province, on New Guinea. On a visit there Monday, Wahid said he would not tolerate attempts to break up Indonesia.

President Vladimir Putin wrapped up a thorny debate over Russia's national symbols _ and its post-Communist identity _ by signing a package of laws Tuesday resurrecting the melody of the Soviet anthem as Russia's state hymn. The package has something for everyone: It also endorses the tricolor flag used since the 1991 Soviet collapse and the czarist-era state emblem of a double-headed eagle. Putin has said the combination would mend rifts in a nation still deeply divided about decades of Communist rule. Others criticized the package as honoring a totalitarian time and said it reflected Russia's split identity. Both houses of parliament passed the bill earlier this month by a wide margin, but only after debate that dredged up memories of Soviet repressions and resentment of Russia's post-Soviet decline. Lawmakers will not get a say in the next step, however _ deciding on new lyrics for the anthem. With parliament's consent, Putin on Tuesday created a working group of 12 lawmakers and government officials charged with choosing from more than 150 proposed texts. They were given no deadline for their decision, which will then go to Putin for final approval. The anthem law signed Tuesday endorses only the melody by Alexander Alexandrov, not the words praising Soviet dictators Vladimir Lenin and Josef Stalin. The tune replaces the wordless anthem by 19th century Russian composer Mikhail Glinka that the country has been using since 1991, one many Russians complained was too difficult and not as stirring as the Soviet one. Another law in the package gives a nod to Soviet military might by giving Russia's much-weakened armed forces a red flag like the Soviet banner _ but without the hammer and sickle. It also formally approves the flag of white, blue and red stripes that Russia has been using since 1991. Another law endorses the emblem of an eagle holding a scepter and an orb, which is used on currency, documents, uniforms and warships. Communists and other hard-liners opposed the tricolor flag and the eagle emblem, forcing Yeltsin to approve them by decree in the early 1990s. They abandoned their criticism in response to the reintroduction of the Soviet anthem. Illustrating Russia's divisions over its Soviet past, respondents to a poll released Tuesday listed Lenin as their No. 1 choice of ``man of the century'' for their country. Next on the list were Stalin, renowned Soviet dissident Andrei Sakharov, the first man in space, Yuri Gagarin, and Soviet reformer Mikhail Gorbachev, the Interfax news agency reported. The Dec. 16 poll by the Public Opinion Foundation asked 1,500 people across Russia to name a choice without offering any suggestions.

Russian space scientists are experiencing more problems with the aging Mir space station. Although they have reestablished communications with the station after losing it twice in the past day, there are fears that Mir could spin out of control. A dangerous space expert Vladimir Simionov says it could cause serious problems. It's very dangerous because, you know, in such a situation there it's not out of fuel, there is nobody on the station and station is out of control. They don't know whether it's oriented or not. The Russians say they don't know the cause of the original problem. The Russian government decided last month to bring the 14-year-old space station back to earth in a controlled descent because it could no longer afford the high maintenance costs.

A Russian court on Tuesday opened the espionage trial of a Russian researcher whose family maintains his only crime was reading between the lines of military publications. After Tuesday's hearing, the judges agreed to adjourn proceedings until Jan. 9 so defendant Igor Sutyagin, an analyst from the respected Russian think tank, the Institute for USA and Canada studies, could carefully review the charges. The trial is the latest in a spate of espionage trials that human rights activists say signals a witch hunt for independent thinkers and a revival of the vast powers of Russia's secret services. The Federal Security Service, which initiated the case, says it is cracking down on spies who it says infiltrated Russia amid the lawlessness that followed the Soviet collapse. The closed-door trial took place in a run-down courthouse in Kaluga, the regional center of Sutyagin's home province southwest of Moscow. It came three weeks after American businessman Edmond Pope was sentenced to 20 years in prison for espionage. Pope was pardoned by President Vladimir Putin on Dec. 14 and has returned to the United States. The security service, the main successor to the KGB, claims that Sutyagin gave classified information on Russia's military to other countries. The indictment says he was enlisted to spy for the United States when he attended a scientific conference in Britain in early 1998, his lawyer Vladimir Vasiltsov said. The USA and Canada Institute has no access to government secrets, and Sutyagin maintains he only worked with open sources _ analyzing and piecing together separate bits of information. ``He would spread newspaper clippings around on the floor, on the couch, on his desk, everywhere _ and crawl between them,'' said Sutyagin's wife, Irina Manannikova. ``This would go on for days _ and something would be born that way.'' The powers of Russia's special services had been trimmed under ex-President Boris Yeltsin. But many analysts say the agencies have started to reclaim their ground since Putin, a 16-year veteran of the KGB, came to power. In addition to the Pope case, two Russian environmental researchers have recently been tried for treason and espionage for reporting on environmental pollution by the Russian Navy. ``All these cases seemed to have been produced from the same template,'' said Sutyagin's father, Vyacheslav. ``The election of Putin may have served as a signal to start instilling fear.'' Files in Sutyagin's study at his home hold scores of newspaper clippings, mostly from the official military daily Krasnaya Zvezda, with some passages underlined in red. Sutyagin subscribed to several periodicals _ a fact that seemed suspicious to investigators who searched his apartment at the time of his arrest in October 1999. ``They actually asked: By what right do you subscribe to 15 periodicals at a time?'' said the researcher's father. Sutyagin, 35, spent 14 months in jail awaiting trial. But he received the first details of the charges against him only in an indictment filed on Dec. 15, according to his lawyer. The U.S. State Department would not comment on the case Tuesday.

A manhunt swept across north Texas on Tuesday after law enforcement officials linked a Christmas Eve robbery and the killing of a police officer to seven convicts who escaped from a state prison earlier this month. The seven men are now being sought on capital murder charges in the death of Aubry Hawkins, 29, a police officer killed Sunday night while investigating a robbery at an Oshman's sporting goods store in Irving, just west of Dallas. All seven escapees are considered armed and dangerous, according to Lori Bailey, a spokeswoman for the Dallas office of the FBI. ``We are very surprised to see that these convicts are still all together. That's highly unusual, in that it doesn't lend itself to concealment,'' she said. ``That's just an indicator of how bold they are, how brash they are, and of how dangerous they are.'' The convicts have been identified by Texas authorities as Joseph C. Garcia, who had been serving a 50-year sentence for murder; Randy Ethan Halprin, serving 30 years for injury to a child; Larry James Harper, sentenced to 50 years for aggravated assault and sexual assault; Patrick Henry Murphy Jr., serving a 50-year sentence for aggravated assault with a deadly weapon; Donald Keith Newbury, serving a life sentence for aggravated robbery with a deadly weapon; George Rivas, serving five years for burglary and kidnapping; and Michael Anthony Rodriguez, serving a life sentence for capital murder. Agents of the FBI, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms, and the Texas Department of Public Safety joined local police and sheriff's departments in trying to track the escapees on Tuesday, officials said. According to the FBI and Irving police officials, the robbers entered the Oshman's store around 6 p.m. and herded 23 employees into a corner, where they were tied and handcuffed. Someone outside the store called police at around 6:30 p.m., saying that ``things just didn't look right at the front of the store,'' the officials said. Hawkins was the first policeman to arrive at the scene, and was apparently shot as the robbers escaped out the back. They fled in a Ford Explorer owned by the store's manager; officials said the vehicle was later found abandoned in Irving around midnight. Bailey said that the convicts had stolen cash and weapons from the store, but that she did not know whether Hawkins had exchanged gunfire with them. ``We just don't know yet whether the officer fired at them. His weapon is also missing,'' she said. Witnesses to the robbery identified all seven of the escaped convicts as participants, she said. Authorities thought they had the men cornered on Tuesday at a motel in Arlington and surrounded the building, Bailey said. But that turned out to be a false alarm, she said. On Dec. 13, the seven men overpowered their guards and impersonated a civilian work crew to escape from the John B. Connally Jr. maximum security prison 65 miles southeast of San Antonio, stealing 14 weapons and hundreds of rounds of ammunition during the breakout. A note left behind by the escapees warned that ``you haven't heard the last of us yet,'' Texas prison officials said Monday.

Ousted Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori pledged in an article Wednesday to mount a political comeback, but said he would not return soon to his homeland because of ``political persecution.'' Fujimori, who has been in self-imposed exile in Japan since November, was declared unfit for office by Peru's Congress after he resigned amid corruption scandals involving his former spy chief. Fujimori did not say whether his political future would include an attempted return to the presidency. But he vowed to remain in the arena. ``I am now determined to start anew and undertake a political program to make Peru a truly just and great country,'' Fujimori wrote in the article published Wednesday on the front page of the Yomiuri newspaper, the first of four installments. Fujimori, who ruled Peru for 10 years with an authoritarian hand, said he would embark on his new political program ``if and when the innumerable accusations now leveled against me are proved groundless.'' But he said ``political persecution'' by the new government made it unsafe for him to return to Lima for now. ``This is simply a revival of the Inquisition that occurred during the Middle Ages,'' Fujimori wrote, saying his successor, interim President Valentin Paniagua of mounting a campaign of persecution under the guise of fighting corruption. Earlier this month, the Japanese government announced that the 62-year-old Fujimori _ the son of Japanese immigrants _ held Japanese citizenship and therefore could stay indefinitely in Japan, his parents' birthplace. Tokyo's decision set off an outrage across Peru, where authorities are investigating Fujimori's connections with his one-time spymaster and top adviser, Vladimiro Montesinos. Montesinos, a fugitive rumored to be hiding out in Venezuela, is wanted on charges of money-laundering and influence-peddling. Fujimori, who has denied any wrongdoing, could also face charges if he returns to Peru. Fujimori said he chose exile in Japan to avoid potential violence between his supporters and enemies that could have broken out if he had returned. He said he also feared he could become a victim of that violence. ``Furthermore, I could not neglect the safety of my own life,'' he wrote.

Celebrations marking the end of Islam's fasting month went ahead amid tight security Wednesday despite fears that Indonesia's Christians would seek revenge for a series of deadly church bombings. Thousands of police and soldiers were deployed in Jakarta and other cities, and security forces stood guard at mosques and churches in the world's most populous Muslim nation. Officials here had worried that mosques might be targeted in revenge attacks, but no religious violence was reported on Wednesday, the first day of the two-day Muslim religious holiday Eid al-Fitr. Three days earlier, on Christmas Eve, explosions at Christian churches in nine Indonesian cities killed 15 people. It was one of the most coordinated terrorist attacks to hit Indonesia, which has been troubled by years of civil unrest. President Abdurrahman Wahid said he feared provocateurs were trying to spark violence between the Muslim majority and Christian minority as a way of destabilizing his government. Muslims make up about 90 percent of Indonesia's 210 million people, and the attacks came just before the holiday that marks the end of Ramadan, the Muslim fasting month. In the wake of the bombings, church leaders called on Christians not to seek revenge against Muslims during the holiday. Media reports said a church in Kudus, a district 120 miles southeast of Jakarta, was slightly damaged in an arson attack on Tuesday, but no other attacks were reported against either side. On Tuesday night, as Ramadan ended, hundreds of thousands of people ignored official calls to stay at home and instead poured into the streets to celebrate. Many banged drums and set off firecrackers after evening prayers. The next morning, Jakarta's streets were quiet. Guards searched bags and used metal detectors to check thousands of worshippers who entered the city's main Istiqual mosque. Security was also tight at the nearby state palace, where Wahid meet thousands of wellwishers. No one has taken responsibility for Sunday's blasts. Police have arrested four suspects and detained dozens of others for questioning. ``We have not come to a conclusion about which group is responsible or the motive,'' National Police Chief Gen. Suroyo Bimantoro said. Elsewhere Wednesday, media reports said rebels in Indonesia's restive Irian Jaya province had captured two members of the federal security forces. The state Antara news agency said some 20 guerrillas belonging to the Free Papua Movement mounted a raid on Tor Atas district, near the provincial capital, Jayapura. They apprehended two police sergeants guarding the local church, the agency said. A police spokesman in Jayapura said the security forces were searching for the missing men. Irian Jaya, some 2,500 miles west of Jakarta, is a former Dutch colony. Insurgents there have been battling for independence since Indonesia occupied the province in 1963. Calls to secede have grown in the region in recent months, and a series of rebel flag-raising protests and clashes with security forces have left dozens dead.

Ghana's ruling party, hoping to convince voters that its candidate represents change, is distancing itself from the country's longtime leader, outgoing President Jerry Rawlings. Vice President John Atta Mills, Rawlings' chosen successor, faces opposition leader John Agyekum Kuffuor in a runoff election Thursday after neither received the 50 percent required for an outright win in the first round on Dec. 7. Kuffuor, a British-trained lawyer and veteran politician, won 48.4 percent of the vote. Mills won 44.8 percent. ``I am my own man, and I will have my own team,'' Mills said during a round of weekend campaign rallies. Rawlings, a charismatic former fighter pilot, has dominated politics in the West African country for two decades. Originally a military dictator, he embraced democratic and free-market ideals in the 1990s, becoming a darling of Western donors. But his overwhelming popularity has been dimmed in recent years by a steep decline in the country's once-thriving economy. Prices for cocoa and gold, Ghana's most important exports, have plummeted as oil prices have risen. Many Ghanaians now say they would welcome a change of government. ``I like (the ruling party) but I think they have outlived their usefulness and so must give way,'' student Patrick Azaglo said at a recent rally. Kuffuor, 62, has campaigned on a platform of ``positive change,'' calling attention to repeated accusations of corruption and human rights abuses against Rawlings' government. Mills, 56, has in the past stressed the development and stability that the Rawlings regime has brought to Ghana. Both candidates have promised to improve the economy, education and health services. Five other candidates who together took only a small percentage of the first-round vote have endorsed Kuffuor. The elections mark the end of an era for Ghana, where Rawlings is stepping down at the end of his second term in January. He won multiparty elections in 1992 and 1996, but is barred by the constitution he approved from running for another four-year term. Ghana, which has experienced five military regimes since independence from Britain in 1957, has evolved under Rawlings, its longest-serving leader, into a multiparty nation with a flourishing independent press. Rawlings' departure marks a rare commitment to democratic change in a region characterized by repressive leaders and flawed elections. While mostly peaceful, the first round of voting was marred by post-election clashes between Kuffuor and Mills supporters in Ghana's Upper East region, which killed about 10 people.

Long lines formed before dawn Thursday at polling stations in this West African capital, where scattered reports of violence marred a runoff vote for a successor to longtime President Jerry Rawlings. A group of people stormed a polling station in a residential neighborhood shortly after voting started, smashing the ballot box and tearing up the voter's list, security officials said. It was not immediately clear who the attackers were. Details were sketchy, but witnesses said gunshots were fired near another polling station in the same neighborhood during a scuffle between soldiers and opposition officials. Two people were injured, according to an opposition official interviewed on state-run radio. The violence did not appear to deter voters in the capital, however: Many were already lined up outside voting booths hours before balloting started amid heavy security. And in other parts of the country, voting was progressing smoothly, radio reports said. Rawlings' chosen successor, Vice President John Atta Mills, was facing opposition leader John Agyekum Kuffuor in Thursday's runoff. Neither received the 50 percent required for an outright win in the first round on Dec. 7. Kuffuor, a British-trained lawyer and veteran politician, won 48.4 percent of the vote the first time around. Mills won 44.8 percent. The elections mark the end of an era for Ghana, where Rawlings is stepping down at the end of his second term on Jan. 7. He won multiparty elections in 1992 and 1996 but is barred by the constitution he approved from running for another four-year term. Rawlings, a charismatic former fighter pilot, has dominated Ghanaian politics for two decades. Originally a military dictator, he embraced democratic and free-market ideals in the 1990s, becoming a darling of Western donors. But his overwhelming popularity has been dimmed in recent years by a steep decline in the country's once-thriving economy. Prices for cocoa and gold, Ghana's most important exports, have plummeted as oil prices have risen. Many Ghanaians now say they would welcome a change of government. ``I am out here again in fulfillment of my desire to contribute to change,'' said taxi driver Eric Ayivor, who voted in Accra. ``If I have to, I will vote 10 times to bring about that change.'' Ghana's ruling National Democratic Congress, hoping to convince voters that its candidate represents change, distanced itself from Rawlings in the days leading up to Thursday's vote. ``I am my own man, and I will have my own team,'' Mills, 56, said during a round of weekend campaign rallies. In the past, he had stressed the development and stability that the Rawlings regime has brought to Ghana.

In an address to the nation Wednesday night, Rawlings appealed for a peaceful and orderly vote. ``There is no honor in winning an election by foul means or through violent behavior,'' he said.

President Clinton will not travel to North Korea before the end of his term, leaving further progress in establishing an accord with the communist nation to his successor, George W. Bush. ``I believe the next administration will be able to consummate this agreement,'' Clinton said. ``I expect visits back and forth. I think a lot of things will happen'' that will ``make the world a better place.'' Clinton said at a news conference that there is not enough time left in his presidency _ just three weeks _ to prepare and execute the trip ``in an appropriate manner.'' The United States has been seeking an agreement to curb North Korean missile production and development. In an earlier statement, the president explained that there would have to be progress toward an agreement ``that advances our national interest'' before he made such a trip, and there was not enough time for that. The president insisted he had made a ``lot of progress'' with North Korea. ``I expect the next administration to build on it,'' he said. ``In the days I have remaining, I didn't have the time to put the trip together and execute it in the proper way,'' Clinton said. The North Korean leader, Kim Jong Il, invited Clinton in October and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright traveled to the communist nation for talks with Kim. The president said Kim ``put forward a serious proposal concerning his missile program. Since then, we have discussed with North Korea proposals to eliminate its missile export program as well as to halt further missile development.'' Clinton said engagement with North Korea, in coordination with South Korea and Japan, ``holds great promise and that the United States should continue to build on the progress we have made.'' He also praised the engagement policy of South Korea's president, Kim Dae Jung. Clinton said he told Bush ``that further progress could be made and that it might just have to be something that was done when he became president.''

Peru's former armed forces commander, a close associate of fugitive ex-spy chief Vladimiro Montesinos, has been arrested near the border with Ecuador, police said. Gen. Jose Villanueva Ruesta, who resigned in October, was arrested Friday in the coastal city of Tumbes, 620 miles northwest of the capital, Lima. He is the highest-profile figure to be detained amid criminal investigations surrounding Montesinos and his reputed web of influence peddling, illicit arms dealing and human rights abuses. News reports said Villanueva was in a hotel with his wife and bodyguards when he was arrested. He reportedly put up no resistance. Hours earlier, Villanueva had told local television stations that he was not trying to leave the country, but was merely on a family vacation. After those interviews appeared, a police communique broadcast on television and radio said a judicial order had been put out for Villanueva's house arrest to prevent him from fleeing the country. It was unclear whether authorities had been alerted to Villanueva's whereabouts by the TV interviews. It also wasn't clear what charges, if any, had been brought against Villanueva. The general has been accused by Montesinos' former security guards of helping to hide the spy chief before his escape from the country Oct. 29. Villanueva, a former academy classmate of Montesinos, also has been accused of amassing property and wealth beyond the means of his military salary. Villanueva has consistently denied any illicit involvement with Montesinos, who is wanted on illegal arms dealing charges, laundering drug profits, influence peddling and directing death squads. But in October, Villanueva and two other military commanders resigned after rumors they might be plotting a coup to restore the ousted spy chief. For a decade, Montesinos was the top adviser to now-ousted President Alberto Fujimori. Fujimori gave Montesinos unofficial control of the military, and many here considered Montesinos the most powerful man in Peru. But in September, Peru was thrown into turmoil with the release of a video showing Montesinos apparently bribing a congressman to support Fujimori. After weeks of uproar over the scandal, Fujimori fled to Japan and Congress deemed him unfit to rule. Montesinos also fled the country. State attorney Jose Ugaz, who was appointed to investigate Montesinos and his accomplices, has said there is sufficient evidence to start criminal investigations against more than 200 members of the military, government and business sector. Congress recently approved anti-corruption legislation giving prosecutors power to detain those suspected of corruption for up to 15 days without filing charges. The legislation was designed to prevent suspects from leaving the country, but it also allows prosecutors to make plea bargain deals in exchange for testimony and evidence.

Never mind about Carmen Sandiego and Waldo. Where in the world is Vladimiro Montesinos? Since disappearing late in October, Montesinos, former chief of Peru's intelligence network, has become the most hunted man in Latin America. But in spite of a tantalizing trail of clues and reports of stopovers and sightings in places ranging from the Galapagos Islands to Caracas, he has managed _ with the help of fake passports and disguises _ to elude all of his would-be captors. Montesinos is the key figure in the scandal that last month toppled President Alberto Fujimori of Peru, who is now in self-imposed exile in Japan. Peruvian investigators accuse Montesinos, 56, of corruption, election fraud, extortion, drug trafficking, money laundering, bribery and rights abuses. They have pledges from countries in the region that he will be extradited to Peru if caught. The Peruvian crisis erupted in September with the broadcast of a videotape that showed Montesinos, who had spent a decade as the president's most powerful adviser, apparently paying a $15,000 bribe to a member of Congress. Montesinos sought asylum in Panama, but returned semi-clandestinely to Peru less than a month later. His return set off a widely publicized manhunt, led by Fujimori himself, that government critics dismissed as a farce. Three of Montesinos' former bodyguards, who parted ways with him and ended up back in Peru, have told congressional investigators there that they left Peru with Montesinos on Oct. 29 aboard a yacht called the Karisma. They said the vessel sailed to Puerto Villamil, Ecuador, on the island of Isabela in the Galapagos, where a group of Montesinos associates took refuge at a secluded beachfront hotel called the Ballena Azul, or Blue Whale. The hotel's proprietor, Dora Gruber, recalled that a woman _ believed to be Montesinos' aide Aurora Guzman _ made the reservation for the group and was reluctant to discuss Montesinos when a report about him appeared on television. Hotel owners and staff members were told that a group of journalists would be coming from Peru. But the supposed journalists ``hardly left their cabanas, even for meals,'' Gruber said, ``and if Montesinos himself were here, he never showed his face,'' apparently staying aboard the yacht until arrangements to move on were set. The bodyguards have told Peruvian investigators that Montesinos eventually sailed from Isabela to Cocos Island, a Costa Rican possession in the Pacific. But officials at the airport in Puerto Villamil say that a man roughly matching Montesinos' description left their island aboard a chartered plane in mid-November. The Costa Rican government, in turn, maintains that Montesinos entered its territory on Nov. 21, using a Venezuelan passport issued in the name of Manuel Antonio Rodriguez Perez. Two days later, their records show, a man using the same passport boarded a private flight bound for Aruba, a Dutch possession in the Caribbean just off Venezuela. By this point, Montesinos, who is tall, hawk-nosed, balding, fair-skinned and wears glasses, is said to have grown a beard. And his appearance may have been altered further after he arrived in Venezuela, which has a flourishing plastic surgery industry. Venezuela's foreign minister, Jose Vicente Rangel, at first dismissed reports that Montesinos was in the country, saying they were based on ``speculation and false rumor.'' Just before Christmas, Venezuelan security officials produced a 27-year-old Peruvian engineer named Manuel Alexander Rodriguez Perez who they said was the cause of the muddle. ``There has been a mistake in trying to confuse Mr. Alexander with Vladimiro,'' said Edgar Rodriguez, deputy director of Venezuelan state security, some of whose members have in the past had close relationships with Montesinos. ``This man could never be Vladimiro Montesinos,'' he said of the young engineer, brown-skinned and chubby, who has now returned to Peru and dropped out of sight. But the director of the Instituto Diagnostico, a private clinic in Caracas, said last week that a man named Manuel Rodriguez Perez underwent surgery on his nose and eyelids on Dec. 13. The doctor who performed the operation is said to have taken photographs of his patient, but he has not been located because he left on what is described as a long vacation. Now authorities in all the countries involved in the manhunt say they are baffled as to Montesinos' whereabouts. There have been reports that he never left Peru and remains in hiding there; reports that he flew secretly to Paraguay; theories that he may have headed for Morocco; even talk that he has made his way to Europe to be closer to an estimated $800 million stashed in secret bank accounts there. But no one can be sure, which only adds to the legend. ``Up until some time ago, it was thought he was in Venezuela,'' Peru's prime minister, Javier Perez de Cuellar, said at a news conference in Lima on Tuesday. ``Now we have no evidence to say that he is still in Venezuela,'' he said. ``Maybe he is, maybe he isn't. That's all I can say.''

Russia's revived Soviet-era national anthem, which once praised the atheist Communist Party and dictator Josef Stalin, now celebrates Russia as a ``holy country'' that is ``protected by God.'' Russian President Vladimir Putin on Saturday approved the new version, written by the same person who co-authored the old lyrics, poet Sergei Mikhalkov. ``Russia, our holy country!'' the new anthem begins. It goes on to praise the country's vast ``forests and fields ... from the southern seas to the polar region.'' The Soviet-era music was revived earlier this month by the Russian parliament, replacing the wordless anthem by 19th-century composer Mikhail Glinka that had been in use since the collapse of the Soviet Union nearly a decade ago. Putin and the legislature agreed to revive the old anthem, saying the Glinka tune didn't have any words and was too hard to sing anyway. But they needed new lyrics, because the old Soviet anthem's praise for the Communist Party was no longer considered appropriate after the 1991 collapse of communism. Putin accepted the recommendation of an advisory committee, which favored new words from the 87-year-old Mikhalkov. The anthem got its first official performance later Saturday at a Kremlin reception. ``The anthem is not simply a symbol. It is impossible to live without it,'' Putin said at the reception. Mikhalkov co-wrote the first version praising Stalin, Soviet founder Vladimir Lenin and the Communist Party. He later did another version removing Stalin's name after the dictator's memory became politically unpalatable. Stalin, who died in 1953, carried out political repressions that historians say killed tens of millions of people. The new lyrics' reference to God would have been unthinkable under the Communists, who enforced a policy of official atheism and persecuted religious believers. The last anthem to mention God was ``God Save the Czar,'' used by the regime that collapsed in 1917. But unlike ``God Save The Czar,'' which refers to the ``Orthodox czar,'' the anthem doesn't specify any particular faith. Russia's dominant religion is Orthodox Christianity, but religious minorities include Muslims, Jews, Buddhists, Catholics, and Protestants. One line offers something to those nostalgic for the Soviet Union. It refers to Russia as an ``eternal union of fraternal peoples,'' words similar to the old version, which refers to ``an unbreakable union'' of ``peoples in brotherhood strong.'' Liberal politicians and some cultural figures have assailed the reinstatement of the Soviet music, saying it invokes the memory of totalitarian rule and political repression. Former President Boris Yeltsin blocked Communist attempts to bring back the old tune, written by Alexander Alexandrov in 1944. Putin, elected March 26, has been more willing to accept symbols of the Soviet past. He agreed on a compromise under which the old anthem would be restored, while Russia would keep the post-Soviet tricolor flag and the state coat of arms with the czarist double-headed eagle.

Charging through his first year at Russia's helm, Vladimir Putin rarely stepped on the brakes, ramming through measure after measure to consolidate his grip on power. But as he enters 2001, the tasks still look enormous: a seemingly endless war in Chechnya and a populace demoralized by years of crime, poverty and corruption. ``I hope that with time, Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin will turn from the problems he knows to the real problems plaguing society,'' said Vladimir Rimskiy, an analyst with the Information for Democracy Foundation. Boris Yeltsin shocked the nation and the world when he abruptly stepped down Dec. 31, 1999, and named his prime minister acting president. But Russians were pleased with the choice, and they delivered Putin a resounding victory in the March 26 presidential election. Putin quickly moved to remake the relationship between Moscow and the regions, pushed through tax reform and a long-stalled arms control treaty, and toured the world to underline that Russia was still a power to be reckoned with. He said his policies were oriented toward a common goal: priming Russia for reform to reverse the nation's decline. The economy was buoyed by high world prices for oil, one of Russia's major export earners, but it was widely expected to decline in 2001 as oil prices fall. Putin warned this week that economic growth, which reached some 7 percent in 2000, was already sagging, and that unemployment seemed to be rising. The popularity he won through raising pensions and salaries _ bringing real income up by 7 percent _ could fade fast if the economy sinks. Putin told Russian reporters this week that he was torn between the need to institute far-reaching reforms and to ease social pressures. ``I always keep in mind that despite all the positive tendencies, a huge number of our citizens endure extreme hardship and live in poverty,'' Putin told Russian journalists this week. ``I would not say that this feeling helps to make pragmatic or even technocratic decisions in the economic sphere ... . But this feeling helps me to make more balanced decisions and it is by no means harmful for a leader of such a country.'' Putin's other big, haunting problem is the Chechen war. In spite of his vows to crush separatist rebels, the conflict has ground into its 16th month. Putin has shown no sign that he would try to negotiate an end to the war next year _ and rebels have demonstrated time and again that they can inflict daily casualties on federal forces. The explosion and sinking of the nuclear submarine Kursk underlined the decay in the Russian armed forces and the pressing need for long-delayed military reform. Putin said this week that Russia's long-term goal must be a professional army to replace the mandatory draft _ but he said that would take years. Aging infrastructure and frequently flouted safety regulations also took their toll in 2000. The fire that ravaged the Ostankino television tower pointed up the disastrous neglect that put Russian lives at risk every day. Yet Putin has not indicated that he'll devote scarce resources to cleaning up the mess. Russians' chief hope was that the new president would reverse the nation's decades-long decline, which accelerated following the 1991 Soviet breakup. They saw in Putin everything that his predecessor Boris Yeltsin lacked: energy, sobriety, pragmatism and a knack for forging consensus. Putin, a 16-year veteran of the Soviet KGB, proved to be a talented political operator. His team combined liberal economists and old-style security operatives, and he pushed Russia to acknowledge its contradictory heritage by adopting symbols including the czarist, double-headed eagle and the Soviet anthem. He deftly disarmed almost all opposition, either by coopting dissenting politicians, cowing them or simply pushing them out. The lower house of parliament, the State Duma, acceded to his every request, from cutting the powers of regional governors to passing the nation's first balanced budget. Most of the media fell in lockstep behind him. Putin's most ambitious project was administrative reform to reassert the federal government's control over the country's 89 regions. The move was aimed at undoing one of Yeltsin's legacies: giving the regions autonomy, which some leaders had used to build their own political and economic empires. He also worked to make good on his pledge to raise Russia's standing in the world. Less than a month after winning the presidential election, he persuaded the two parliamentary chambers finally to ratify the 1993 START II nuclear arms reduction treaty, which Yeltsin and President Clinton had signed in 1993 and the former, Communist-dominated legislature had blocked. But there was also a chill in U.S.-Russian relations. Putin repeatedly objected to Washington's possible deployment of a new, limited missile defense. More ominously, for the first time in 40 years, an American was convicted of espionage in Russia. Edmond Pope, a former naval officer-turned-freelance defense contractor, protested his innocence, and both his lawyer and the U.S. government said prosecutors didn't prove his guilt. Still, Pope was sentenced to the maximum 20 years in prison. Putin pardoned him as a humanitarian gesture. In a series of whirlwind foreign visits, Putin made fast friends with Western leaders, including British Prime Minister Tony Blair and German Chancellor Helmut Schroeder. But he discomfited the United States in particular with trips to such old Soviet allies as North Korea and Cuba. At home, such visits won him praise from the Communists and other hard-liners. Liberals expressed misgivings. ``He decided to become a link between them and the rest of civilization, and that's not a bad thing,'' said Mikhail Fedotov, the head of the Russian Journalists Union. ``But when you go into a quarantine ward trying to cure someone else, it's important not to get infected yourself. Don't turn Russia into North Korea.'' There were worrying signs that the government would crack down on press freedoms. In January, federal authorities arrested Radio Liberty reporter Andrei Babitsky in Chechnya and handed him over to alleged Chechen rebels _ whom Babitsky claimed were tied with Russian security services. Human rights advocates claimed Putin had given the security services and prosecutors new freedom to persecute opponents, including environmentalists and business leaders Boris Berezovsky and Vladimir Gusinsky. The two are among the so-called oligarchs who used their connections with Yeltsin's inner circle to spin vast fortunes, and both own large media interests in Russia. Putin denied the agencies were working for political ends, but at every turn he stressed the need to safeguard the nation's security. And he vowed that his administration would not tolerate the oligarchs' interference in government. Putin spoke frequently about the need for economic reform, and he surrounded himself with pro-market economists. But with the exception of the tax reform _ which introduced a flat, 13 percent income tax as of Jan. 1, 2001 _ the government did not manage to turn any reform policy into reality. ``This year has been the year of missed chances,'' said Boris Nemtsov, a leader of the pro-reform Union of Right Forces. He said Putin's priorities in 2001 should be revamping the nation's natural gas, electricity, and railroad monopolies; carrying out land reform; strengthening the corrupt and ineffectual court system; and implementing radical cuts in the military. Another area where Russians expect results is in the battle against corruption. In spite of Putin's pledge to install a ``dictatorship of law,'' bribe-taking, favoritism and the diversion of state funds still thrive. Rimskiy, the political analyst, said continuing corruption proved that Putin still had not established enough authority to tackle the nation's most difficult problems. ``I think that Vladimir Putin is, as a person, concerned to end corruption. He thinks it's unacceptable to allow criminals to come to come to power, to allow budget money to be squandered, that it's absolutely unacceptable that people freeze in the winter when there are enough energy resources,'' Rimskiy said. ``But he's unable to solve these problems. His tragedy is that he understands this, he feels that it's not working _ a management system that could achieve big government tasks.''

Next on VOA, Issues in the News. Correspondents offer their views on developments in the news. The panel this week includes David Ateman of The American Spectator, Tom de Frank, Washington Bureau Chief of The New York Daily News, Martin Shram of the Scripts Howard News Service and the moderator, Fred Barnes of the Weekly Standard. Here is Mr. Barnes. The year 2000, a time of three Presidents and a Prime Minister in trouble. In the United States George W Bush was elected narrowly. In Mexico Vicente Fox became President ousting the PRI after eighty years in power. In Russia Vladimir Putin replaced Boris Yeltsin as President. And in the Middle East, new violence and the collapse of Prime Minister Ehud Barak's overtures to the Palestinians. Well, we are going to look back on the year 2000, David, let me start with you. I want to start first with someone you know about, a country, you know a lot about Russia and that's Vladimir Putin. Is Russia better off at the end of 2000 than it was before Putin became President? No, I don't think Russia is better off. Russia's leadership is more stable and more predictable. But the issues that caused a lot of people worries both inside and outside of Russia at the end of the year 1999 are still with us - serious economic depression, problems of corruption, worries about the ability of the country to make its basic medical services operate. The stories of Russia's decline have not really stopped during the reign of Vladimir Putin. And it's remarkable that Putin has resorted to some of the symbolism of the old times of Soviet grandeur to try and resurrect the notion of Russia as a great, well potentially a great power. For example, the resumption of the old Soviet National Anthem, which is actually a splendid tune by the way, those of you who haven't heard it. But it's the words that some people . Well, the words have actually been dormant since the death of Stalin because when Stalin was alive they lauded him to the skies, now they have just the music and not the words. But more seriously, Putin has made a number of errors this year. One of them of course is very dilatory response to the tragic sinking of the Russian submarine and the sense that he really wasn't quite on top of things at that time when he should have been. He's made some very growling noises to the media. He has started to arrest some of the Oligarchs, which many Russians of course applaud but that raises serious problems of how much he respects law and order. On Foreign Policy he's been a lot more inventive than Yeltsin has. For example, he has been to China. He clearly wants to establish a good relationship with China. Perhaps to sort of triangulate against the United States he has been to Cuba. But on the other hand, he does not seem an adventurer. We don't see him doing type things to tweak the United States. I think the jury is still out on what he's going to be like long term. Yeah. Tom de Frank, what about relations with the United States? Now Bill Clinton of course as President has tried to charm every foreign leader and he has done a pretty good job in some cases. Putin is not a part of that. George W Bush is a charming man but I don't think he's gonna be conducting diplomacy by charm and I think he has a very Jonah's view of the Russians. He was very critical of the Russians in one of the debates, in one of the political debates last year talking about degrafting corruption. He didn't call the Russians a Basket Case but he privately believes that the Russian economy is a Basket Case and that the only reason that anybody pays him any attention is because they still have nuclear weapons around. We'll go back to Clinton and Putin again . Would you say since Putin came in that American Russian relations are worse than they were under Yeltsin who got along well with, at least with Clinton? I think they are - I think they are worse not egregiously worse, but they certainly haven't improved, that's to put it my way. Now some American officials say well, but you are not seeing the whole picture, we are quietly making progress on disarming a lot of the nuclear brushes, nuclear arsenal, but still I think strategically relations are very rocky. What do you think about American-Russian relations, Marty? Well, I agree with Tom. Vladimir Putin never went to charm school and he's not going to be influenced by it either. He's an old KGB guy and that's the way he is. The central fact of what's wrong in Russia today is that you can, doesn't matter what face you put on the flag that flies on the rooftop, if a building doesn't have a foundation that's solid in infrastructure, then it can't really stand and that's the problem in Russia. Its economy, everything about it, there is no infrastructure and that's the fundamental thing that is so difficult to fix and all of the glad hands across the sea kind of stuff won't even work to shore that up either. That's a real problem. tom? Going forward into 2001 Fred, there's the prospect of a continuing irritant between the United States and Russia and that is Strategic Missile Defense. So President Elect Bush has made it clear that if he's not totally wedded to this massive Ronald Reagan Star Wars type of program, he's at least heading in that direction. Well, his party is though, isn't it? He is heading down that road, yeah. And during the campaign Bush made it clear that he wanted a more robust strategic Missile Defense than the Clinton administration was proposing and the Russians were even upset with the Clinton proposal. Bush has also said that if he cannot get the Russians to agree to accept his defense, his Defense plan, he would suggest withdrawing from the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, which of course the Russians have gone berserk about saying that is a bad faith in the part of the United - that would be bad faith in the part of the United States and of course it's a blow at Russian Nationalism which is what really galvanizes the Russians more than anything else, the desire for respect even when they basically don't seem to be deserving of much these days. And so I think we see that, we are gonna see continuing prospects for friction. Well, I am not sure about that. I think Bush's approach to Foreign policy overall, at least as far as one can determine from what he was saying during the debates and the campaign, may make a difference in terms of how the Russians look at the United States. The notion of being humble in Foreign Policy. I don't think that's just a platitude in Bush's case, I think he was really put off, as many people were, by some of the kind of hubris made of the statements made about the United States' role in the world during the Clinton administration. I mean somebody said that the United States was the indispensable nation. Well, that's probably not the case. And I think if Bush is able to project to Putin that he, the United States does not have all the secrets to unwrap, to resolve Russia's problems and he's going to deal with some degree of respect, I think you could see an improvement in relations with Russia. Well, Bush will certainly deal with the Russians out of respect, but I still ... I am not sure how he'll resolve this problem over strategic Missile Defense. You've got a fundamental factor too in Dick Cheney, who certainly knows about the strategic Missile Defense battle. And you know where he's going to weigh and he thinks there should be indeed the changes that the Republican Party's been talking about for sometime and the Clinton administration resisted.

This is VOA News Now broadcasting from Washington. I am Ray Krugell at one hour six Universal time. Ghana's new President is calling for cooperation to strengthen their nation's troubled economy. In his first conference as President Elect, John Kufore pledged to work with the private sector to generate the wealth needed to develop the nation. Mr. Kufore said that is the only way for Ghana to achieve its vision of putting quality into such important sectors as health education and infrastructure. Mr. Kufore will be inaugurated January 7th after defeating Vice President John Ata Mills in a runoff election with nearly 57% of the votes. The election marked the end of nineteen years of rule by charismatic leader Jerry Rowlings. Mr. Rowlings is barred by the constitution from a third presidential term. He came to power in a 1981 coup, then won multi-party elections in 1992 and 1996. Phillip Alexio spoke with George Aitae, President of the Free Africa Foundation and professor of Economics in American University in Washington. Professor Aitae says, unlike his predecessor, President Elect Kufore supports free market economics and is a strong advocate for Human Rights. One of the major reasons why he was able to defeat Mills is that the Kenyan people simply wanted a change. Jerry Rowlings, you may recall, has been in power for nineteen years and under his tenure the economic problems of the country has gotten worse, inflation has been solid, unemployment is here 30%, interest rates at about 50% and corruption has become rampant and people were simply fed up with the regime and they wanted change. Well what is Mr. Kufore saying that he can do that has not been able to be done under Jerry Rowlings? Oh, I think the main thing that Kufore brings with his new administration is accountability, transparency. A lot of things happened under the Rowlings regime without due process of law and we didn't have the rule of law in Ghana. There were corrupt who built mansions and they were not brought to book, they were not held accountable. And Ghanaians are hoping that all this will change and that the new Kufore regime will be looking more closely at the economy and also ease the hardships which they have been facing. So the economy for the most part and the desire for change were the reasons that John Kufore for the most part was able to step in and I guess gain the confidence of the people? Oh yes, certainly. Ghanaians have been yearning for change for a long time and they have also been yearning to see the establishment of accountability and the rule of law and transparency. Too many crooks have gotten away with their loot and Ghanaians believe that these people need to be brought to book. And I think there's a new wave of optimism now sweeping the country and I think that will be, this new wave will be a positive factor in changing things surrounding Ghana. And what about the parliament in Ghana? It's now drastically altered at this point after these elections. Oh yes. The parliament is now firmly in the hands of the opposition and the Kufore's party won 89 seats in parliament and Rowlings party won 82 seats. And so the opposition together will be able to bring about the change that we need to move the country forward. Did Jerry Rowlings ever do any good for the country or was he pretty much a sort of a problem for the country during his two terms? Well, you know for every leader you will always find some good things and also some bad things that the leader did turn the country around in 1981, especially on the economic front. When the economy was down on its knees he was able to change that around. You may remember that the World Bank healed Ghana's economic history. But I think the main problem with the Rowlings regime was that the regime didn't really believe in what it was doing, it did not believe in free market reform. It wanted to loosen control over the economy, yet at the same time it was imbued with this control mentality, it wanted to control everything and that was very contradictory. So he couldn't do that at the same time. And also his political record and the Human Rights record was simply abominable. Under his Human Rights record we had serious violations. People were being beaten up. Even his own Vice President, former Vice President Akha was beaten up by Rowlings in December 1995 and this sort of record sort of sullied his achievements on the economic front. What will be the greatest challenge then for President Elect Kufore as he moves forward now because with all of the problems that you have been discussing, how difficult will it be for him to implement change and for change to actually take place? I think his greatest challenge right now is to assure Ghanaians that he's the President for all of them. Unfortunately Rowlings did not act as a President for Ghanaians. And he also needs to convince Ghanaians that he has a genuine program to turn the economy around. We need to boost investment in Ghana and we also need to have institutional reform in Ghana. The government sector, it serves - the government sector is just too bloated, it needs to be trimmed. The military and the security forces, they also need to be reformed. Ghana currently spends too much on security, that needs to be cut back, the educational sector, the healthcare sector all need to be reformed and also like that. So he is coming in with a great deal of problems to look at in a country. And I think that this is the time for Ghanaians to rally around this new President Elect to help him confront some of the problems in Ghana. George Aitae, President of the Free Africa Foundation and professor of Economics in American University in Washington, he was speaking with News Now's Phillip Alexio.

Popocatepetl, Mexico's magnificent and mystical 17,945-foot peak, has been called the world's most dangerous volcano. Nearly 30 million people live within view of it, most of them in Mexico City, 40 miles west, and Puebl, 30 miles east. More than 300,000 people living in the danger zone directly under the volcano regard it as a living thing, a magical man-mountain, a geological god giving rain and rich land. On Dec. 18, when it erupted in what some scientists said was its biggest explosion in a millennium, they came to regard it with a little more fear than awe. But they now have more than a little science to mix with their magic. Since 1994, when it awakened from a seven-decade slumber, Popocatepetl (which is pronounced poh-poh-kah-TEH-peh-til and means ``smoking mountain'' in Nahuatl, the indigenous language of Mexico) has become the world's most elaborately monitored volcano. Seismologists, geologists, volcanologists and mathematicians have been watching and recording its every tremor. As a result, scientists were able to predict within hours that it was about to blow on Dec. 18, and officials evacuated more than half of the people in the valleys below. And therein lies a tale. On average, a volcano erupts somewhere about once a week. Ten or 12 eruptions a year have the potential to kill people. Two or three a decade threaten mass death and destruction. And 75 percent of the biggest eruptions in the past two centuries came from volcanoes never known, in human history, to have erupted before. Scientists understand a lot about volcanoes. They know the earth has three layers: its dense core, its partly molten mantle, and its crust, broken into 16 major tectonic plates, moving almost imperceptibly, a few inches a year. And they know that all along the Pacific coast, from Alaska to Chile, the plates that underlie the ocean are scraping under the land. At the edges of these plates, rivers of molten rock, called magma, bubble toward the surface of the earth. Magma that reaches the surface is called lava, and volcanoes are built from accumulated lava, rock, ash and dust. In hot spots along rifts in the plates, the magma can erupt with volcanic force. But there is much they do not know about why volcanoes erupt when they do, and as a result volcanoes remain a lethal threat to those who live around them. Since May 18, 1980, when Mount St. Helens erupted in Washington state, causing 57 deaths, volcanoes have killed nearly 30,000 people, driven more than a million people from their homes, and caused billions of dollars of damage. More than 25,000 people were killed in 1985, when the Nevado del Ruiz volcano in Colombia erupted after months of restless rumbling, sending rivers of mud and ash called lahars down on the town of Armero. The deaths could have been prevented, scientists say, if the volcano's warning signs could have been detected, analyzed and transmitted in time. Volcano monitoring systems do exist. After Mount St. Helens, scientists from the U.S. Geological Survey began devising portable volcano monitoring instruments that could be set up together in 70-pound early-warning systems. They could chart changes in sulphur dioxide and carbon dioxide in the air, the tilt and temperature of the ground, the most minor earthquakes and tremors, and debris flows that would otherwise go undetected. Transmitters to send the data _with radio, antenna and a year's power supply _ were packed into nine-gallon steel drums. The system provided a continuous, real-time history of seismic activity. The system was originally intended for the Pacific Coast ranges of California, Oregon and Washington, but after Nevado del Ruiz, the U.S. Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance, an arm of the Agency for International Development, asked the geological survey to set up a global program. The result was the world's only rapid-response team of its kind, the Volcano Disaster Assistance Program. ``The truth of the matter with volcanoes is that no one knows what will happen next,'' said Dan Miller, a research geologist who is the chief of the program, which has headquarters in Vancouver, Wash. ``Volcanoes are not that consistent and not that well understood. But what happened at Nevado del Ruiz didn't need to have happened.'' When a volcano becomes active, the team can move quickly (though only when invited by another nation's government, through a formal request to the State Department). It now has worked at 19 volcanoes in 15 nations. Within days, it can install monitoring equipment, detect magma flowing to the surface and forecast eruptions with reasonable accuracy. ``Forecasting exactly when an eruption will occur is very difficult,'' Miller said. ``And eruptions can go on for months and even years.'' When Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines reawakened on April 2, 1991, after lying dormant for more than 500 years, Philippine scientists called in the disaster assistance program to install a monitoring network. The sensors gave clear warning of a catastrophic explosion, which came two months later. By that time, 75,000 people, including 18,000 members of the American military, had been evacuated. ``We were lucky,'' Miller said. ``The volcano was threatening big, destructive eruptions and it produced them a few days after the signs were clear and accurately interpreted. Tens of thousands of lives were saved. And the entire effort cost less than $1.5 million.'' Things went less well at Montserrat, in the British West Indies, in 1995. The team installed its monitoring network at the Soufriere volcano, watched magma moving up to surface and transmitted the danger signs. But it was more than two years before the volcano truly exploded, by which time the force of the warnings had dwindled. At least 19 people died and the capital, Plymouth, was destroyed by lava and ash. In December 1994, Popocatepetl, which is geologically similar to the volcanoes in the Cascade Range in Washington and Oregon that the U.S. geological team knew best, became active with a series of eruptions after lying dormant since 1927. Scientists from the National University of Mexico and the National Disaster Prevention Center (known by its Spanish acronym, CENAPRED) already had installed four seismic sensing stations on the volcano's flanks. But they asked for help. The result has been, by most volcanologists' accounts, one of the world's best volcano monitoring networks. Working together, the Mexican and U.S. scientists set up a device called a tiltmeter to detect infinitesimal shifts in the slope of the volcano, which becomes swollen when magma rises into it. A tiltmeter works like a carpenter's level, with a bubble in the middle that sets off an electrical impulse when it shifts. The one at Popocatepetl is so sensitive that if you had a 3,000-foot bar of steel, and slipped a nickel under one end, the tiltmeter at the other end would detect it. The Mexicans and the U.S. team installed a special seismometer, an acoustic-flow monitor, that could pick up a small lahar flowing by. They had specially equipped surveyors' rods, enhanced by lasers, to detect bulges in the volcano. They deployed other sensors to pick up ground movements along with shifts in gases, electrical and magnetic fields that flow from subterranean movements of magma. They had special detectors to listen for the phenomena called harmonic tremors, earth vibrations set off by moving magma for reasons no one really understands. They also had, it should go without saying, a network of Popocams, or video cameras hooked up to the Internet, watching over the smoking mountain. All of this was woven together at Popocatepetl in a system called Earthworm, which allows instant acquisition and sharing of data over the Internet. Two weeks ago, as the volcano began showing signs of a big eruption, CENAPRED scientists could sit in a control room on the southern edge of Mexico City and watch it. But their work would mean nothing if the people who live under the volcano did not get their message or ignored it. When a warning goes from CENAPRED through radio and television, it reaches most of the 217 towns in the danger zone within minutes. And in the 24 towns that radio cannot reach, a satellite telephone alerts local leaders, who ring church bells to sound the alarm. Alejandro Rivera Dominguez, a seismologist affiliated with the Center for Disaster Prevention at Puebla University, described the 300,000 people around Popocatepetl as mostly poor, many of them farmers who are especially reluctant to leave their fields and herds behind. To them, he said, the volcano is a sacred symbol that cannot be fathomed by science, a rain god and a giver of good harvests. The authorities, he said, have learned to speak and think of Popocatepetl with a more folkloric, more magical language in order to better communicate warnings to the villagers, Rivera said. That may be. For nearly a week before Popocatepetl's spectacular nighttime explosion on Dec. 18, the alarms had gone out from CENAPRED to the countryside, the church bells had rung. Thousands heeded the warnings, but thousands resisted, saying they were less fearful of lava and ash than the possibility that soldiers and policemen sent to protect them would loot their homes instead. ``We've been holding out for a week now,'' said Jose Felipe Pacheco, 26, a farmer from Santiago Xanitzintla, one of the communities closest to the crater, as he left his home reluctantly, under pressure from army officers, more than eight hours after the first huge eruption. ``Our belongings, all that we have, and have earned through such sacrifice _ and to think that we could come back to an empty home, losing everything you've worked for. ``Leaving is in my best interest,'' he said. ``But staying is also in my best interest.''

In Ghana political leaders are promising a smooth transition to a government run by President Elect John Kufore of the New Patriotic Party. As the opposition gets ready to take power for the first time in almost twenty years, teams from the outgoing and incoming governments are expected to hold closed door talks for several more days. Mr. Kufore won a runoff presidential vote against Vice President John Ata Mills, the chosen successor of President Jerry Rowlings.

The new 107th US Congress begins work later Wednesday. Eleven newly elected Senators will be sworn in at a ceremony presided over by Al Gore, the outgoing Vice President who lost the presidential election to George W Bush. Action on many issues was stalled in the Congress during the 2000 session because of deep partisan differences but despite the gridlock there was movement on a few foreign policy matters including debt relief for developing nations and the relaxation of the trade embargo on Cuba. VOA's David Swan has this year-end report. Earlier in the year the Clinton administration's attempt to ease the developing world's debt burden appeared to be a lost cause. But a few months later lawmakers gave the White House what it wanted, 435 million dollars to forgive at least some of the crushing loans owed by the poorest countries. The turnabout came because of pressure from an unusual coalition ranging from the Pope to rock singer Bonnal and including both Republicans and Democrats on Capitol Hill. The bi-partisan group outvoted critics who argued the plan as too expensive. Republican Congressman Spencer Baccus put the issue in stark terms. A world that lives in poverty, hunger and disease. A world, which last night 40,000 people died of starvation and preventable disease, last night as we slept. Mr. Baccus argued successfully that the measure will cost Americans little while making a great impact abroad. In another key vote Congress approved 1.3 billion dollars to help Colombia fight the drug cartels though some fear US troops will be pulled into that conflict. Republican Senator Ted Stevens had a heated exchange with General Charles Whilom, the Pentagon commander in the Latin American region. Who's going to go in if this blows up? Got eight hundred people on the ground. Tell me this is not a Vietnam again. Sir, it is not a Vietnam again. I spent 65, 66, 69 and 70 in Vietnam and I think I'll know it when I see it happening again. When I go to Colombia I do not feel a quagmire sucking at my boots. The move to allow food and medicine shipments to Cuba was also controversial, though it marks only a limited break in the 38-year economic blockade of the island. The measure also permits sales to Iran, Libya, Sudan and North Korea. While there was little strong objection to the proposed limited dealings with those governments, Cuban American House members and conservative Republicans did fight to block anything that might help Fidel Castro. This left the final legislation a good deal weaker than its backers wanted. It bars US banks from financing the sales, meaning Havana must either pay cash or obtain credits from Third countries. The President, who eventually signed the Bill, attacked this provision. It looks like it eases the embargo on food and medicine but it probably doesn't very much because it doesn't provide any financing credits, which we give to other poor countries whereas it definitely restricts the ability of the Executive branch to increase people to people contacts between Americans and Cubans. One issue seems likely to come up again in the New Year. In a victory for supporters of legalized abortion Congress lifted restrictions on aid to overseas family planning groups that provide abortion services or campaign for abortion rights. But abortion opponents say the move is only a temporary setback. No family planning funds can be given out until February after a new President takes office. If that President is Republican George W Bush he may bring back the restrictions. This decision and the fight over food for Cuba show that some old battle lines remain clearly drawn in Congress but the vote to provide debt relief is a sign these divisions are not absolute.

And I am Tony Riggs bringing you this hour of VOA News Now. The top US official for African Affairs says she hopes that George W Bush's administration will sustain the increased level of attention Africa has enjoyed under the Clinton administration. Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs Susan Rice says initiatives in education, conflict resolution and fighting the HIV AIDs epidemic and promoting trade and investment should be continued in the next administration. Walter Kensteiner, one of President Elect Bush's chief Africa advisors tells VOA that Africa will matter. Today's Dateline examines Africa policy in a Bush administration. Here's Carol Castielle. Assistant Secretary of State Susan Rice recently spoke at the foreign press center in Washington about the progress made in US Africa relations as well as the challenges that lie ahead for the Bush administration. She singled out Botswana, South Africa and Mauritius as examples of democracy, development and good governance. Susan Rice also praised the December cease-fire agreement between Ethiopia and Eritrea. UN Secretary General Kofi Annan and the organization of African unity or OAU helped to broker that agreement, which was recently signed in Algiers. What I believe this agreement indicates, as was actually said by Secretary General Kofi Annan and others in our view, is that it is possible to end the wars that have been started to bring peace in a substantive and comprehensive way. It is not easy, it is long and hard and there are many conflicts that remain to be resolved. But our efforts and those of the parties themselves and the OAU itself are one's that are important and in my estimation need to continue in the months and years ahead. Susan Rice, whose most recent visit to Africa was just last month, said the United States is also concerned about what she called the Zimbabwe government's disrespect for the rule of law over the legitimate issue of land reform. We have been very, very plain in recognizing and in fact condemning the historical inequities in land distribution in Zimbabwe. But having said that, the way that the government of Zimbabwe has gone about it, we think is deeply troubling and deeply flawed. There is no need for violence, there is no need for abrogation of the rule of law. Walter Kensteiner is a partner at the Washington based Skoquaft Group and key advisor to President Elect Bush on African matters. He says Secretary of State designate Colin Powell intends to place a high priority on Africa. Very interestingly General Powell started his transition meeting at the State Department. And the first regional Bureau that he went to go get briefed on and he requested it with Africa, a small signal but I think it's an important signal. Mr. Kensteiner went on to say that the new administration will be prepared to deal with many of Africa's trouble spots such as the Horn of Africa, the Congo and Zimbabwe. I think Secretary of State Colin Powell will indeed have Africa as a key set of issues that he will deal with. Number one, there won't be any choice in the sense that there are going to be crises that arise, in fact there are ongoing crises right now that need attention and American diplomacy will be brought to the fore to help resolve some of those crisis. Clearly some of the challenges that the Clinton administration has been working on and in effect will leave for the Bush administration will include the International War that's now taking place in the Congo, that is a tough, festering problem that has a lot of challenges involved and no easy solution. There's the civil war in Sierra Leone that is continuing. The Eritrean Ethiopian war has been brought to we hope a conclusion but there still is a peace process that has to be complied with and effectively put in place. I think a very large issue that is looming for the Bush administration will be the situation in Zimbabwe. And of course the political economic situation in Zimbabwe is also tied into the first crisis and that's the Congo issue. So many of these problems are overlapping and all of them are ongoing. In addition to civil conflicts Mr. Kensteiner said helping to prevent the spread of HIV AIDs will be central to the new administration's Africa strategy. There are two issues involved and one is attacking the problem of prevention, that is how do you designate resources and how do you actually roll out a prevention program. And then the other is actually assisting those that have already contracted HIV and what do you do about helping those that are already inflicted. The latter is far more expensive than the former and something humanitarian point of view should be and needs to be done on that. But there is a very large consensus now building in the public heath care community that says the prevention part, that is education campaigns and the like have to be done and so we don't have an ever increasing number of people contracting HIV. Mr. Kensteiner also underscored the importance Secretary of State designate Colin Powell will place on economic development in Africa. He said specifically that debt relief and promoting bi-lateral trade and investment will rank high on the agenda. I think debt relief will be a major focus for a Bush administration. And I say that because a Colin Powell led State Department will want to focus on economic development and part of that economic development will be reducing the debt structures that are overhanging so many of these African countries. You know you look at the African trade Bill for instance and interestingly enough it was really the Republicans that passed that Bill. There were far more Republicans that voted for the African Trade Bill than Democrats and that's for a whole host of US domestic reasons. But it also signifies the willingness to open up our markets to African countries in order to assist their industrial base and a willingness to really help economic development throughout sub-Saharan Africa. And so I think on the debt relief side there is an understanding that we've got to lessen the load of debt servicing. Although Mr. Kensteiner said efforts to promote trade and investment would not occur at the expense of aid, he acknowledged that the new administration will accentuate private sector partnerships. If the emphasis is on one or the other, I think it would be on trade. Opening up our markets to African goods and services and also encouraging US private sector to look at foreign direct investment in Africa and that could come both from corporate America but also from Wall Street in the guise of private equity funds, venture capital funds, all of those can in fact be encouraged by official government practices and policies. And I would expect and hope that the Bush administration will in fact facilitate that kind of direct investment in Africa. During the presidential campaign Mr. Bush did not include Africa as a region he considered vital to US national interest. However, if Colin Powell pursues the agenda Mr. Kenstenier outlined, Africa can expect to enjoy the same if not a greater level of attention from the new administration that it enjoyed during the Clinton years. Africa policy in a Bush administration was the subject of today's Dateline. I am Carol Castielle.

The Voice of America presents differing points of views on a wide variety of issues. Next, an editorial expressing the policies of the United States government. A Federal Grand Jury in New York has indicted five more suspects in connection with the August 1998 bombing of the United States embassies in Nairobi Kenya and Dar-e-salaam Tanzania. These terrorist attacks killed hundreds and wounded thousands of men, women and children. The indictments raised to 22 the number of those accused in the bombings. Of the seventeen terrorists previously charged, eight have been captured. The remaining fugitives, including Osama Bin Laden, are still being sought by the US. The latest to be indicted are Saif Al Adel, Mushan Musa Matwali Atwa, Ahmed Mohammed Hamid Ali, Ahnes Alibi and Abdullah Ahmed Ardullah. All are members of Al-Qaida, an Islamic terrorist group organized by Osama Bin Laden. Al-Qaida has helped train terrorist from Tajikstan, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Chechnya, Somalia, Sudan, Yemen, the Philippines, Egypt, Libya, Pakistan and Eritrea. Al-Qaida receives safe haven from Taliban controlled Afghanistan where it operates a network of training facilities and conducts international terrorist operations. The United Nations Security Council voted to expand sanctions on the Taliban movement because of its support for Al-Qaida and other terrorists. The US supports these sanctions. The US calls on the Taliban movement to end its sponsorship of international terrorism and hand over the terrorist fugitives it now protects. The US is offering a reward of up to 5 million dollars for information that leads to the apprehension or conviction of Al-Qaida terrorists Sheikh Amed Salim Suedan, Ahmed Galani, Mustafa Mohammed Fadel, Imn Auzava Heari, Mohammed Altaf and Osama Bin Laden for their part in the African embassy bombings. The US will not rest until these men have been brought to justice for their crimes. That was an editorial expressing the policies of the United States government.

Police here blocked a top associate of fugitive ex-spy chief Vladimiro Montesinos from boarding a plane to Miami, Peru's justice minister said. Retired Gen. Julio Salazar was detained Tuesday in Lima's Jorge Chavez International Airport before getting onto a commercial flight, Justice Minister Diego Garcia Sayan said. ``He apparently tried to flee the country,'' Garcia Sayan told reporters. ``We hope this is not a further signal that all those who are under investigation follow a similar route.'' Garcia Sayan said Salazar had been placed under house arrest, but a communique from the Justice Ministry broadcast later over the radio corrected the statement, saying the retired general had merely been prevented from leaving Peru. Salazar, a one-time Peruvian defense minister, officially headed the now-defunct National Intelligence Service for much of the 1990s. But he took orders from the agency's de facto chief, Montesinos, who is wanted in Peru on charges from money laundering and influence peddling to allegations that he directed death squads. Congressman David Waisman, head of a congressional commission investigating Montesinos' reputed web of corruption, said Salazar would likely face criminal charges stemming from his failure to justify unexplained wealth during testimony before the commission. He did not elaborate. For a decade, Montesinos was the top adviser to now-ousted President Alberto Fujimori. Fujimori gave Montesinos unofficial control of the military, and many here considered Montesinos the most powerful man in Peru. But in September, Peru was thrown into turmoil with the release of a video showing Montesinos apparently bribing a congressman to support Fujimori. After weeks of uproar over the scandal, Fujimori fled to Japan and Congress deemed him unfit to rule. Montesinos also fled the country. Authorities say another former defense minister, retired Gen. Victor Malca, fled the country after the congressional commission discovered he had some $14 million in bank accounts in Peru and in the Cayman Islands. And on Friday, retired Gen. Jose Villanueva Ruesta, the former armed forces commander, was placed under house arrest after he was detained near the border with Ecuador. He has denied any illicit involvement with Montesinos.

pentagon sources tell cnn the commander of the "uss cole" failed to implement basic measures to protect his crew. 17 sailors were killed when the warship was bombed in a terrorist attack. jamie m intyre has details. cnn has learned that the crew of the "uss cole" was not briefed on the seriousness of the threat in yemen, nor warned to be on guard for possible terrorist attack the day the warship was bombed. when the "uss cole" entered the port of aden october it was operating under "threat condition bravo," an alert level that warns of "an increased and more predictable threat of terrorist activity." pentagon sources say almost half of 62 security measures that were intended to protect the "uss cole" from terrorist attack were not carried out. while many were not required because the "cole" was refueling in the harbor, not at a pier, others were judged to be significant lapses, according to sources. for instance, the ship protection plan filed by the "cole's" commanding officer of terrorism and warned to be suspicious and inquisitive of strangers. another provision specifically warned that small boats require special concern because they can serve as an ideal platform for terrorists. but lippold failed to ensure the those briefings were given according to pentagon sources. the crew was also supposed to identify and inspect all work boats, keep unauthorized craft away from the ship, and prepare fire hoses to repel borders. those precautions were not taken either, sources say. the 40-foot hole in the side of the "uss cole" has now been patched, and the warship is in mississippi for repairs that will cost $ 240 million and take a year to complete. senior navy officials are still debating the fate of commander lippold, who along with several subordinate officers, could be subject to career-ending discipline, if it's judged the security lapses left the billion-dollar destroyer more vulnerable to attack. jamie m intyre, cnn, the pentagon.

nbc news "in depth" tonight. the latest on the search for seven fugitives who escaped from a texas prison three weeks ago and are accused of killing a police officer while stealing guns from a sporting goods store after their escape. all seven were convicted of serious crimes. their sentences ranging from 30 years to life, when they broke out december 13th. we begin "in depth" tonight a new national effort to find these armed and very dangerous men. here's nbc's shelly smith. tonight, the manhunt for the texas seven escapees goes nationwide, as the fbi files federal charges against the convicts who busted out of a maximum security prison last month. now every federal agency in the nation can begin looking for them. the latest on the escapees is that they are possibly driving a dark red minivan. in north texas, police officers prepare for the worst. inside the state command center, phones are buzzing with hundreds of tips from across the nation. mug shots of the gang e-mailed to neighboring states, police there asked for help. our biggest prayer right now is that this can be ended without bloodshed. the intensity of the search, propelled by shocking news of an autopsy report showing officer aubrey hawkins was shot 11 times, police say, by the gang of seven during a christmas eve robbery at this sporting goods store in a dallas suburb. hawkins took six hits to the head. police say the escapees then ran over him as they made off with weapons and cash. while many criminals may say, "i'm never going to be taken alive," when it really gets down to it, not a lot of them live up to that commitment. but the ominous note left behind after their daring prison escape still haunts investigators. in it, the convicts warned we haven't heard the last of them yet. the note tells me these guys had a plan, that there was something on their minds beyond escaping from prison. after three weeks, still no positive sighting. why has it taken so long to find them? police believe they are hiding out with the same people who helped them escape. that assistance they are getting from the free world is a big obstacle to us. another obstacle, these dated mug shots, which in some cases are nearly ten years old. this week, police posted new photos on the state's website. police believe the ringleader of the group is 30-year-old george rivas of el paso, described as one of the most dangerous men in texas -- so fascinated with guns, he named his dogs ruger and beretta, two popular gun manufacturers. publicly, police say they hope this will end peacefully. privately, they worry rivas' gang has stolen more than 40 weapons, thousands of rounds of ammo, and they've already proven they're not afraid to shoot. shellee smith, nbc news, dallas. now that the texas manhunt has gone national, what do the experts say about the chances of catching the bad guys? we continue "in depth" with nbc's pete williams. some officials in texas cite a familiar maxim in law enforcement -- if they don't catch a prisoner within three hours or three miles of an escape, they're in for a long manhunt. but how long? it took florida state police just 11 days to capture five of six inmates who staged a stunning escape five years ago by digging a tunnel under a prison chapel. even so, the last of them, who did better planning, getting outside help for his getaway, wasn't found for two more years, in mexico. but a former fbi profiler says that while the texas prison break seems well-planned, police have something going for them. he says groups of escaped prisoners eventually crack under the pressure of a sustained manhunt. they're restless, they're bored with the norm. they seek excitement. they don't hole up well. they get bored. there's going to be infighting within the group, and that will create a schism and a fracture within the group, and that's when this thing is going to unravel and come apart. no national figures manhunt lasts. but the ultimate capture numbers for high-profile federal fugitives are impressive -- for the u.s. marshal's service, about 92% of those on its 15 most wanted fugitives list. the fbi has tracked down about 94% of those on its ten most wanted list. average time on the fbi's list, 316 days. the fbi says massive publicity can be a huge help putting more pressure on fugitives, making it harder for them to hide. and it can also generate valuable leads. we look at it as if we can interview thousands of people at one time and develop information regarding the whereabouts of these fugitives. just the kind of pressure that texas authorities hope tonight will bring them a break, and soon. pete williams, nbc news, washington.

It's still three weeks away but already Swiss authorities are up security at Davos, Switzerland for the annual meeting of international finance heavyweights at the World Economic Forum. Officials have already rejected a protest permit from anti-World Trade Organization demonstrators who wanted to rally outside. But may be as The World's Marco Werman explains, it's not demonstrators in the street that the Swiss should be watching. These days, you might expect activist musicians in the Basque region of Spain to be concerned primarily about the 32 year long war for an independent Basque homeland. But for the area's leading musical spokesman Fairmin Mugorotha the Basque struggle is just a snapshot of a greater fight. In the early 90s Fairmin Mugorotha headed Basque punk band Nago Goriac. His fierce independence led him to found his own record label Esano Zanki. It was Mugorotha's musical and political statement. He didn't want multinational corporations owning his music. Fairmin Mugorotha gets his inspirations from reggae, Scar and rock-and-roll. He sings and speaks in Basque, only in Basque. What seems odd is that Mugorotha's musical audience would have had difficulty migrating to the Basque region were it not for globalization. Through his translator, the songwriter says, he recognizes the irony. Even though it looks like a paradox, he says that this is necessary to strive for a social justice type of mentality or consciousness. On his most recent recording, Brigadistac sound system , Fairmin Mugorotha makes his views clear. War is a mere spectacle, he sings in Urun, or far away. The slaves of globalization, Kosovo, Congo, Sierra Leone watch, the lyrics go, while the murderers sing "all you need is love" at the G-7 meetings. He thinks that there is a big critical movement of consciousness that is against globalization and considers that capitalism is based on man-to-man exploitation basis. He thinks what he sings, before if there was a world of exploiters and exploited, now it's the world of globalizers and the globalized and for him is very important the alliances that are created internationally in the resistance movement. Of course, there is another irony here that the resistance movement Fairmin Mugorotha belongs to relies on the infrastructure of globalization to spread its anti-globalization message. That movement includes other pop musicians. The Washington DC based punk rock band Fugazi refuses to charge more than 5 dollars per concert and releases music on its own label. And a few more main stream performers have played a role in the anti-globalization movement. Fairmin Mugorotha praises rapper 'Ice T' and his band for performing in Basque country. He really appreciates what Ice T did some years ago. They came all the way from LA and if they were only paid the trip to participate in a political concert organized by the Basque youth, they are independentist of the left wing. They participated in the concert and it was a fantastic experience. Rapper Ice T and the Basque rock reggae man Fairmin Mugorotha come off as unlikely allies. But then again who would have guessed that a man singing in Basque would be a central player in the international fight against globalization. For The World, I'm Marco Werman.

Two members of gang of fugitives accused of killing a police officer after they escaped from prison were spotted at a bank in San Marcos, local police said Friday. State investigators, however, said the sighting was unconfirmed. San Marcos Police Chief Stephen Griffith said witnesses twice identified two of the fugitives as being at the bank in his city, 35 miles northeast of San Antonio. ``It is our belief at this point and time, based on witness identification of two sets of photos, that we have an accurate sighting,'' he said. ``We believe there was a bank casing going on.'' But Texas Department of Criminal Justice spokesman Larry Todd wouldn't confirm the sighting. ``We've had simultaneous sightings in San Marcos, Texas, Durango, Colorado, a small town in southern Oklahoma and someplace in Louisiana,'' Todd told reporters in Austin. Police were analyzing security camera footage and possible fingerprints, Griffith said. Officers are on high alert, he said, and SWAT teams were on standby. The seven convicts _ two killers, two armed robbers, a child abuser, a serial rapist and a burglar _ broke out from the state prison at Kenedy on Dec. 13 by stealing clothing from staff members and bluffing their way to the rear gate, authorities said. The group is accused of pulling off a Christmas Eve holdup at a sporting goods store in Irving in which a police officer was slain. Officer Aubrey Hawkins was shot 11 times _ six times in the head _ and was also run over by a vehicle. Todd would not say if security cameras at the San Marcos bank showed anything suspicious. ``We are trying not to panic the public, but certainly to advise them of the potential danger,'' he said. More than 1,200 leads have been received since the escape, and each lead must be investigated, Todd said. The Irving Police Department released updated sketches Friday to reflect the fugitives' appearances at the time of the escape. Police said they had reason to believe two of the suspects were injured. Irving Police spokesman David Tull said tests of blood found in the car used in the gang's escape from the sporting goods store found blood from three sources, including the slain officer.

nbc news "in depth" tonight. the continuing search for seven, armed and very dangerous fugitives in texas, as the mother of a murdered cop says lax security in the state prison is to blame for her son's death. texas has the 2nd largest prison population in the country behind california, and it actually has a good record on escapes. of 150,000 inmates statewide, there were just seven escapes last year. all but one were caught. but that was before december 13th when these seven broke out. with the latest, here's nbc's shellee smith, "in depth." if you want to know how tense it is in texas tonight, just look at the reaction to a simple burglar alarm. guns drawn, a s.w.a.t. team cautiously approaches this sporting goods store in arlington. after a full search that takes hours, a sigh of relief -- another false alarm. in san marcos, near austin, bank employees call police after a suspicious man enters, appears to check out the security, asks about opening an account, then quickly leaves with several other men in three cars. witnesses identify two of the texas seven escapees. it may be a good sighting. we don't have hard forensic proof. we don't have fingerprints. we don't have anything else that leads us to yes, these were these seven individuals. the seven bandits who broke out of a maximum security prison last month. it's the latest in a string of sightings in texas, oklahoma, colorado and louisiana. wanted signs are everywhere, even on pizza boxes. today, police release new sketches of the escapees, highlighting their features. joseph garcia has a large mole. larry harper, an infection around his lip. harper and george rivas, the alleged ringleader, both wear glasses. and new information about blood found at the scene of a christmas eve robbery in which officer aubrey hawkins was shot 11 times. police say rivas' gang executed him. lab tests show hawkins wasn't the only one hurt. we have very good reason to believe that two of the suspects were injured during some point. mounting pressure tonight on the texas prison system from the grieving mother of that officer, demanding answers about the death of her son. he did every day what he loved. today, jayne hawkins wrote a scathing letter, published in "the dallas morning news," criticizing the lax security in texas' prison system. she was having dinner with her son just moments before he was killed. the photographs of the prison on television show razor wire. i think, "what's the point?" why do we have that when they can drive out? the convicts took several civilian employees hostage, stole their clothes and a prison truck. there was negligence that night. there is no question in my mind. the state of texas has nothing to be proud of. we're not looking for a scapegoat. we're not looking for excuses. we want to know what happened and let the chips fall where they may. next week we may have a better idea of how seven thugs could drive out of a maximum security prison. that's when the texas department of criminal justice will release its own investigation of the great escape to the public. tonight, here in dallas, what was once a routine call produces a big show of force. shellee smith, nbc news, dallas.

Authorities in Texas are encouraging the public to keep calling with possible leads in the search for seven escaped convicts. They now believe two of the escapees were wounded after a robbery after the prison break. Susanne Spraig reports from member station KERA in Dallas. The seven escaped inmates are suspected of robbing a sporting goods store near Dallas on Christmas Eve and killing a police officer who intervened. Now blood samples found in their get away cars suggest two of the suspects were also injured in the robbery. Authorities hope this latest information will lead to a break in the search for the missing inmates. More than a 1000 calls have poured in to a state police office in Garland, Texas but none of those has produced a positive lead. The mother of the officer who was killed in the Christmas Eve robbery is now blaming lax security at the prison in South Texas, from which the inmates escaped, for her son's death. And a state Senator is calling for public hearings into why the prison was unable to stop the break out. From NPR news I'm Susanne Spraig in Dallas.

Following are excerpts from ``The Tiananmen Papers,'' to be published Monday by PublicAffairs. Longer excerpts will appear in the January/February issue of Foreign Affairs. (Explanations in boldface are by The New York Times.) At first, China's student-led democracy movement seemed to elicit calls within the Communist Party leadership for deeper change. The documents describe the following exchange in a Politburo meeting on May 10, 1989: Li Ruihuan ((Politburo member)): We very much need real dialogue. We can't confront the students with inflammatory or antagonistic propaganda anymore ... We should take a sober look at what has caused the strong rebellious streak in the popular mood in recent times. We said there would be no inflation, then in fact inflation came _ how could people not feel rebellious ...? It makes no sense just to arrest dissidents and hold them in prison. Instead, we should send them abroad and not let them come back for a certain amount of time. Bo Yibo ((party elder)): I agree with Comrade Ruihuan ... Tian Jiyun ((Politburo member)): We need to take effective measures to clean up government and to accelerate our steps toward democracy. Hu Qili ((Politburo member)): Reform of our news media can play an important part in speeding democratization. A critical press will help maintain the vitality and longevity of our party and government. On May 13 the Communist Party general secretary, Zhao Ziyang, pleads with Deng Xiaoping for restraint: Zhao Ziyang: The party has to adjust to new times and situations. We have to do a good job with political education but then use the methods of democracy and law to solve actual problems. ... When we allow some democracy, things might look ``chaotic'' on the surface, but these little ``troubles'' are normal inside a democratic and legal framework. They prevent major upheavals and actually make for stability and peace in the long run. From a Politburo meeting on May 16: Zhao Ziyang: The vast majority of student demonstrators are patriotic and sincerely concerned for our country. We may not approve of all of their methods, but their demands to promote democracy, to deepen the reforms and to root out corruption are quite reasonable, and I even think it's quite understandable when they sometimes go a bit overboard. As the demonstrations continued, the mood began to change, particularly among the party elders. Distressed by the upheaval, they are quoted beginning to talk about a crackdown. From Politburo meetings on May 17: Deng Xiaoping: We want to build a socialist democracy, but we can't possibly do it in a hurry, and still less do we want that Western-style stuff. If our one billion people jumped into multiparty elections, we'd get chaos like the ``all-out civil war'' we saw during the Cultural Revolution. You don't have to have guns and cannon to have a civil war; fists and clubs will do just fine. Democracy is our goal, but we'll never get there without national stability. ... Beijing can't keep on going like this. We first have to settle the instability in Beijing, because if we don't we'll never be able to settle it in the other provinces, regions and cities. Lying down on railroad tracks, beating, smashing and robbing _ if these aren't turmoil then what are they? If things continue like this, we could even end up under house arrest. After thinking long and hard about this, I've concluded that we should bring in the People's Liberation Army and declare martial law in Beijing. The highest decision-making body in China is the Politburo's Standing Committee. The documents indicate that its five members split on martial law. They voted two to two, with one abstention, in a meeting later that day. Their comments as they voted: Li Peng: I support Comrade Xiaoping's views on martial law. ... Yao Yilin: I strongly support Comrade Xiaoping's proposal to impose martial law in Beijing's urban districts. Taking this powerful measure will help restore the city to normalcy, end the state of anarchy, and quickly and effectively stop the turmoil. Zhao Ziyang: I'm against imposing martial law in Beijing. My reason is that, given the extreme feelings of the students at this juncture, to impose martial law will not help calm things down or solve problems. It will only make things more complicated and more sharply confrontational. ... In the 40 years of the People's Republic, our party has learned many lessons from its political and economic mistakes. Given the crisis we now face at home and abroad, I think that one more big political mistake might well cost us all our remaining legitimacy. Hu Qili: After much careful thought, I too have decided that I am against martial law in Beijing. ... Qiao Shi: On the question of martial law, I find it hard to express either support or opposition. Deng Xiaoping: We all feel Beijing can't go on like this; we have to have martial law. ... Chen Yun: We have to stick with our principles no matter what; we have to stay the course with no change. It seems to me that if we can't even hold to these principles, then what we're doing is destroying our People's Republic _ which we won from decades of battle, with the blood of thousands of revolutionary martyrs _ all in a single day. ... Deng Yingchao: Retreat means that we fall, that the People's Republic falls, that a capitalist restoration wins; it'll be what that American, ((former Secretary of State John Foster)) Dulles, hoped for, that our socialism would turn into capitalism after a few generations. The main point in implementing martial law is to get Beijing back to normal as soon as possible and to rescue the children from Tiananmen Square; to see them fasting breaks my heart. Wang Zhen: Give 'em no mercy! The students are nuts if they think this handful of people can overthrow our party and our government! These kids don't know how good they've got it! When we were their age we lived in a forest of rifles and a rain of bullets; we didn't know what a peaceful day was! So aren't they dandy now? Give them peace and they don't want it; they want to go starve themselves instead. ... If the students don't leave Tiananmen on their own, the People's Liberation Army should go in and carry them out. On June 2, the document says, Li Peng gave a highly inflammatory report to the elders, suggesting that Americans and Taiwanese were infiltrating the democracy movement and using it to provoke bloodshed and destabilize China. This helped persuade the elders to order the army to crush the democracy movement: Wang Zhen: Those goddamn bastards! Who do they think they are, trampling on sacred ground like Tiananmen so long? They're really asking for it! We should send the troops right now to grab those counterrevolutionaries, Comrade Xiaoping! What's the People's Liberation Army for anyway? What are martial law troops for? They're supposed to grab counterrevolutionaries. ... Anybody who tries to overthrow the Communist Party deserves death and no burial. ... Li Peng: I strongly urge that we move immediately to clear Tiananmen Square and that we resolutely put an end to the turmoil and the ever-expanding trouble. ... Deng Xiaoping: I agree with all of you and suggest that martial law troops begin tonight to carry out the clearing plan and finish it within two days. ... The next day, June 3, Li Peng gave an even wilder presentation to the leaders, describing as a riot an incident in which civilians harassed soldiers: Li Peng: Late last night a counterrevolutionary riot broke out in Beijing. A small handful of counterrevolutionaries began spreading rumors and openly violating martial law. They were brazen and lawless, and their behavior has aroused extreme indignation among the masses. We must resolutely adopt decisive measures to put down this counterrevolutionary riot tonight. ... Chen Xitong: The lawless elements used all manner of despicable means to defame our soldiers, attack the martial law troops, and stir up trouble between the troops and the citizenry. The situation has become utterly intolerable. We have to take resolute measures at whatever cost to put down the counterrevolutionary riot. ... Li Peng: We have to be absolutely firm in putting down this counterrevolutionary riot in the capital. We must be merciless with the tiny minority of riot elements. The P.L.A. martial law troops, the People's Armed Police, and Public Security are authorized to use any means necessary to deal with people who interfere with the mission. Whatever happens will be the responsibility of those who do not heed warnings. ... Yang Shangkun: The Martial Law Command must make it quite clear to all units that they are to open fire only as a last resort. And let me repeat: No bloodshed within Tiananmen Square _ period. That night, the troops forced their way into the center of Beijing from several directions. In accordance with Yang's directions, the troops held their fire in the central part of Tiananmen Square, but hundreds were killed and thousands injured in other parts of the city. A military bulletin to the leadership describes one of the first clashes: Infantrymen led the way, firing into the air. Then the soldiers _ with the first two rows in a kneeling position and those in back standing _ pointed their weapons at the crowd. Approximately 10:30 p.m., under a barrage of rocks, the troops opened fire.

Citing security concerns, the U.S. Embassy in Rome sent most of its employees home for the day Friday. ``We had credible information and we decided as a precaution to close down the embassy,'' a spokesman for the embassy said. The State Department did not describe the nature of the threat. Other U.S. consulates in Italy remained open, and the embassy said it would decide over the weekend whether to re-open to the public on Monday. Officials in Washington said that U.S. intelligence recently was told of a threat made by Islamic terrorists against the interests of the United States and at least one other country represented in Rome. Other officials said the threat came from people associated with Osama Bin Laden's organization, Al-Qaeda. But officials cautioned that there was no specific threat made against the U.S. Embassy in Rome, which is in the heart of the city and employs 300 workers, Italian and American. An official added that the general threat comes at a time of increased Islamic terrorist threats throughout Europe. An embassy spokesman told The Associated Press that ``we looked at the information and we think it was sufficient justification to take measures to protect'' the staff. It was the first time the embassy had closed for security reasons since the Persian Gulf War, a spokesman, Ian Kelly, told Bloomberg News. He said that U.S. offices in Istanbul, Turkey, and Amman, Jordan, had recently closed for short times for security reasons. While the government insisted that the closing was merely precautionary, it also acted Friday to extend a warning already in effect to citizens traveling abroad. Travelers should maintain a low profile, vary routes and times for travel and treat with suspicion mail from unfamiliar sources, the State Department said. ``Vehicles should not be left unattended, if at all possible, and should be kept locked at all times,'' it added. The extension is of a warning issued on Oct. 12, the day that an apparent suicide attack killed 17 American sailors on the destroyer Cole in Yemen.

Documents reportedly brought out of China by a disaffected civil servant say that the late Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping ordered the violent crackdown on demonstrators at Tiananmen Square out of fear they could topple the Communist regime. The documents reveal deep-seated paranoia that the protests were controlled by unknown anti-communist conspirators and anxiety by the party's top leaders that the more than one million demonstrators gathered on Tiananmen Square could demand their arrest. ``After thinking long and hard about this, I've concluded that we should bring in the People's Liberation Army (PLA) and declare martial law in Beijing,'' Deng was quoted as saying at a meeting held at the Party Central Office on May 18, 1989. The documents say Deng was encouraged by several members of his inner circle, including Wang Zhen, who said, ``The students are nuts if they think this handful of people can overthrow our Party and our government.'' Two weeks later, troops using live ammunition moved in on the demonstrators, ending seven weeks of pro-democracy protests in Beijing. Hundreds were killed on June 4, 1989 and thousands arrested in a nationwide crackdown. The comments by Deng and Zhen _ together with what are said to be minutes of secret high-level meetings, Chinese intelligence reports and records of Deng's private phone calls _ appear in the ``The Tiananmen Papers: The Chinese Leadership's Decision to Use Force Against Their Own People.'' Among other things, the papers appear to verify what many China scholars have long suspected: that hard-liners within the Communist Party urged Deng to use force to suppress students while reformers called for a more democratic solution. The book is excerpted in the January/February edition of Foreign Affairs magazine, and CBS' ''60 Minutes'' posted portions of an interview with the civil servant, who uses the pseudonym Zhang Liang, on its Web site Friday. Zhang, who describes himself as a Communist Party member sympathetic to reformers, now resides outside of China. He said he did not use his real name because he intended one day to return to Beijing. If genuine, the documents offer a rare glimpse into the motivations and fears behind the communist leadership's decision to order the troops into Tiananmen Square, one of the most tragic and defining moments of recent Chinese history. The book was co-edited by Andrew Nathan, a professor of political science at Columbia University, and Perry Link, a professor of Chinese language and literature at Princeton University, who told The Associated Press the documents are consistent with the smattering of information already available outside of China and with the testimonies of other former officials who have since fled. The two professors, both well-known China experts, also spent hours interviewing the former civil servant, who they say painstakingly transcribed original records from files in Beijing and elsewhere onto computer disks, which he brought with him out of China. The book only contains brief excepts from the disks, which, if printed out, would total about 15,000 pages in English. Orville Schell, dean of the journalism school at the University of California-Berkeley and author of several books on China, worked with Nathan and Perry. He said he was skeptical about the authenticity of the documents at first. ``Everyone involved in this project went on an Odyssey from skepticism to belief that these were genuine,'' he said. ``The most important thing was to be able to talk with the compiler.'' He said the author's extensive knowledge of inner workings of Chinese government and the clarity of his motive in releasing documents _ helping reformers now jockeying for position in Beijing _ helped convince him that the work was legitimate. According to the documents, Li Peng, then China's premier, warned Deng on May 17, 1989 that protesters shouting anti-Party and anti-socialist slogans were calling for the government to step down. ``The spear is now pointed directly at you and the others of the elder generation of proletarian revolutionaries,'' he said. Two days after the violent crackdown, Deng reportedly defended the decision in a Central Politburo Standing Committee meeting. ``If we hadn't been firm with these counterrevolutionary riots _ if we hadn't come down hard _ who knows what might have happened? The PLA has suffered a great deal; we owe them a lot, we really do. ``If the plots of the people who were pushing the riots had gotten anywhere, we'd have had civil war,'' he said. In another meeting of the Party Central Office, Deng said: ``A tiny minority is exploiting the students; they want to confuse the people and throw the country into chaos. This is a well-planned plot whose real aim is to reject the Chinese Communist Party.'' Nathan said the documents showed just how deep the divisions were within the party. ``But one thing we learn is that the split within the top leadership on how to deal with student movement was very, very intense,'' said Nathan, who was sought out by the civil servant to help compile the notes into a book. It is a rift, he said, that still exists today. The records reveal that if left to their own preferences the three-man majority of the Politburo Standing Committee would have voted to persist in dialogue with the students instead of declaring martial law. But, according to the Tiananmen papers, the standing committee was obligated by a secret intra-party resolution to refer any stalemate to Deng and the other senior revolutionaries. One of the results was the promotion of the man who eventually replaced Deng, China's current president, Jiang Zemin. ``One thing I learned from the materials was the top leadership was more frightened than we realized,'' said Link, who also witnessed the 1989 protests and crackdown. ``They were genuinely afraid of house arrest.'' China scholars are quick to point out that the timing of the book is no coincidence: with leadership changes scheduled for 2002 and 2003, reform-minded officials within the Communist Party are likely trying to influence the choosing of the next Chinese president. The book's author and his associates, they say, hope the documents will spurt debate on reform by embarrassing hard-liners who encouraged the use of violence. Peter Osnos, publisher and chief executive of Public Affairs, described the book's author as a ``compiler who had been specifically sent abroad with material to find a way to make it available.'' Osnos said a Chinese language compilation of the documents would be published in a few months. Comments allegedly made by Deng show that China saw force as the primary means to squelch democratic tendencies that were sweeping through the country. It also revealed how battling Chinese leaders decided after the crackdown to purge dissenters from the country's leadership. ``We should mete out the necessary punishments, in varying degrees, to the ambitious handful who were trying to subvert the People's Republic,'' Deng was quoted as saying. ``Activities that break the law must be suppressed. We can't just allow people to demonstrate whenever they want to. ``If people demonstrate 365 days a year and don't want to do anything else, reform and opening will get nowhere.''

The search for a gang of seven fugitives from a Texas prison continued Saturday as a state official said a leaked memo detailing their escape had been misconstrued and that supervisors had never left the inmates alone. Part of the memo describing an inmate ``picnic'' during the lunch hour that preceded the Dec. 13 escape was inaccurately reported by the media, said Glen Castlebury, a spokesman for the Texas Department of Criminal Justice. According to the memo, six inmates working in the maintenance department of the medium-security Connally Unit told their civilian supervisors they weren't going to the inmate dining room but planned to eat in the maintenance area. Castlebury said media reports indicated the inmates were left alone when the supervisors left for their own lunch, when in fact a maintenance supervisor had stayed in the room. ``It wasn't like everybody walked away and said 'OK, inmates, take over,''' Castlebury said. A seventh inmate probably joined the others after the supervisors left, the memo said. Castlebury said the inmates overpowered the remaining supervisor, then took the 10 civilian workers and a guard hostage one at a time when they returned from lunch, Castlebury said. He said a report on the investigation of the escape would be released around the middle of the week. ``The memo was written and destined to stay in the hands of people involved in the hunt for the fugitives,'' he said. ``I have no idea how it went from one set of hands to the other.'' The memo was disclosed Friday by KHOU-TV of Houston, which did not say how it obtained the document. After overpowering the supervisors, the memo said, one of the inmates called a guard tower, pretended to be a prison supervisor and said he was sending a crew to work on surveillance equipment. An inmate dressed in stolen civilian clothes then tricked the tower guard into letting him and three other inmates inside, the memo said. After they overpowered that guard, they had control of the tower, an armory and the prison gates. All seven then were able to leave the prison in a truck they had loaded with provisions, 14 pistols, a rifle, a shotgun and more than 200 rounds of ammunition. The fugitives are wanted on capital murder charges following the robbery of a sporting goods store in a Dallas suburb on Christmas Eve. Irving police officer Aubrey Hawkins was shot 11 times _ six times in the head. Authorities across the state had received more than 1,200 tips by Saturday. DNA evidence indicated that two of the inmates probably were injured during the robbery. Irving police said blood from Hawkins and two other people was found in a vehicle that was stolen at the scene and later abandoned. George Rivas, 30, is believed to be the ringleader. He was serving a life sentence for aggravated robbery and kidnapping in El Paso. The others are Larry Harper, 37, serving 50 years for aggravated sexual assault in El Paso; Randy Halprin, 23, serving 30 years for injury to a child; Michael Rodriguez, 38, life for capital murder in San Antonio; Donald Newbury, 38, 99 years for aggravated robbery; Joseph Garcia, 29, 50 years for murder in San Antonio; and Patrick Henry Murphy Jr., 50 years for aggravated sexual assault with a deadly weapon and burglary in Dallas. ___ On the Net: Irving Police Department: www.irvingpd.com Texas Department of Criminal Justice: http://www.tdcj.state.tx.us/index.htm

Amnesty International and the New York-based Human Rights Watch on Saturday called for an independent investigation into torture allegations at some of Turkey's prisons. Representatives of the two human rights groups currently visiting Turkey said they had not been given access to the prisons, where inmates were transferred last month from other prisons after a four-day clash that left 32 people dead. Jonathan Sugden of Human Rights Watch and Heidi Wedel of Amnesty International held talks with lawyers, doctors, relatives of the inmates, and three prisoners released from the new penitentiaries. ``These sources consistently indicate that the prisoners were beaten and some tortured before, during and after the transfers to the prisons,'' the groups said in a statement released Saturday. The statement alleged that prisoners were stripped after they were transferred to the new prisons and ``subjected to rape with a truncheon,'' or nightstick. However, it added, the claims could not be backed up because officials ignored prisoners' lawyers' requests for forensic exams. In a statement Saturday, the Justice Ministry rejected the charges and said three chief inspectors had been appointed to investigate the allegations. Soldiers stormed 20 prisons last month to end a two-month-long hunger strike launched by leftist prisoners protesting government plans to transfer them from large wards to small cells. Thirty inmates and two soldiers died in the raids. Many of the inmates set themselves on fire. Sugden said an investigation should be launched into the raids. Nineteen prisoners have died of burns. Eleven inmates were killed either by fellow inmates or by troops. Inmates _ linked to an armed leftist group that has claimed the killings of generals and business owners _ said they feared abuse by guards in the one- or three-person cells. The government said it could not control the wards that were run like indoctrination centers. Authorities transferred more than 1,000 prisoners into cells after the raids. The human rights groups said the prisoners were being held in solitary isolation, which they said can amount to inhumane and degrading treatment. They called on Turkish authorities to allow prisoners to leave their cells and associate with each other during the day.

Ghana's new President John Kufore took office Sunday in a ceremony attended by Nigerian President Arushogono Basenjo and the Presidents of Senegal, Bokino Faso and Togo. As Louis Ramirez reports, Mr. Kufore promised that multi-party democracy has arrived in Ghana to stay. The inauguration of Mr. Kufore as President was the first time there has been a peaceful transfer of power in Ghana from one democratically elected government to another. During his nearly two decades in power, Jerry Rowlings carried out economic reforms that led to unprecedented growth. With the economy now in decline and corruption rampant in the country, voters turned down the candidate of Mr. Rowlings National Democratic Congress John Ata Mills in runoff elections on December 28th. Voters also handed Mr. Kufore's opposition New Patriotic Party a majority in the Parliament. Jerry Rowlings has not made public exactly what his plans are now that he has left office, other than to say he will work to eradicate malaria. Louis Ramirez, VOA News, West Africa Bureau.

They call it the DD-21 destroyer: an electric-powered stealth ship designed to attack enemies hundreds of miles inland from any of the world's oceans as well as fight at sea. It will carry more Tomahawk cruise missiles and bigger guns than any destroyer in existence, yet will need fewer than a third as many sailors and cost less to operate, say its advocates, who include the secretary of the Navy, Richard Danzig, and leading members of Congress. ``It's like going from sail to steam,'' asserts Kendell Pease, a vice president of General Dynamics and a former rear admiral. General Dynamics will release its first public diagrams of the DD-21 at a Navy conference this week. Yet for all the hoopla over it, the DD-21 faces a gantlet of obstacles emblematic of the broader problems that the armed services and the administration of President-elect George W. Bush will confront as they struggle to balance modernizing the military with paying for the upkeep of the aging equipment they have now. During the campaign, Bush hammered home the need to rebuild the services, calling for an acquisition program that would ``propel America generations ahead in military technology.'' To its advocates, DD-21 fits that goal, and Bush is on record as promoting an earlier version of the DD-21 known as the arsenal ship. But Bush also never explained how he would pay for such leap-ahead technology, and therein lies the rub. Like the other services, the Navy is struggling just to pay for mundane things like fuel, spare parts and paint. And long before it can expect to sail its first DD-21, in 2010, the Navy says it must replace aging planes and rusting ships that are scheduled for retirement in the coming decade. The Congressional Budget Office has predicted that the Pentagon budget will have to grow by as much as $70 billion a year to maintain weapons systems while moving ahead with new ones like the DD-21. Some senior Pentagon officials say the shortfall is well over $100 billion a year. Yet Bush has called for increasing military spending by just $45 billion over the next decade. That means that Bush's choice for secretary of defense, Donald H. Rumsfeld, will almost surely have to cancel or postpone major programs in development, defense analysts say. High on that list of potential victims are the Air Force's F-22 fighter, the most expensive jet in history, costing as much as $180 million each; the Marine Corps' V-22 Osprey tilt-rotor aircraft, at as much as $80 million each; and the DD-21, at $750 million each. Important decisions on the F-22, a stealth fighter for air-to-air combat, could be made as soon as this week, when a Pentagon panel is scheduled to decide whether to allow the plane to go into production. Though an outright cancellation of the program seems unlikely, a chorus of F-22 critics in and outside the Pentagon are calling for a postponement or cutbacks in the program, which has been plagued by production delays and cost overruns. Advisers to Bush have also said they plan to review all of the Pentagon's fighter plane programs this spring. The Marine Corps' V-22 Osprey is also in some peril, having suffered two fatal crashes last year. The departing secretary of defense, William S. Cohen, has called for an independent review of the program, which was almost canceled 11 years ago by Dick Cheney, who was secretary of defense then and has returned to Washington as the vice president-elect. But the DD-21 is arguably the most endangered of the big-ticket programs because it is the furthest from being developed. While actual V-22's and F-22's are already flying, the DD-21, with its radar-deflecting hull and futuristic electric propulsion system, exists mainly on drawing boards at the Bath Iron Works in Maine, owned by General Dynamics, and Ingalls Shipbuilding's yards in Pascagoula, Miss., owned by Litton Industries. The two shipbuilders are heading competing consortiums seeking to design the ship. Under current Navy plans, a contract for the program would be issued this spring, calling for the first DD-21 keel to be laid in 2005 and the first completed ship to enter the fleet in 2010. The Navy wants to build 32 vessels to replace its Spruance-class destroyers. The long lead time will give the destroyer's critics _ and they are many _ time to postpone or kill the program. There are academics who argue that the Navy should build a fleet of small, inexpensive ``street fighter'' ships capable of operating close to shore in mine-infested waters and fending off attacks from low-tech enemies, like the terrorists who nearly sank the destroyer Cole in Yemen last October. Others contend that the Navy could save money by shelving the DD-21 and simply refitting four Trident nuclear submarines, scheduled for retirement, with Tomahawk missiles instead. And critics of Pentagon spending raise questions about the need for a new class of powerful destroyers when the United States faces no superpower rival on the high seas. That money might be better spent on diplomacy than weapons, some contend. ``It feels to me like the Navy is still feeling around for a mission when they really don't have an enemy to face,'' said Eugene Carroll, a retired rear admiral who is vice president of the Center for Defense Information, a nonprofit Pentagon watchdog group. But what the program has going for it is the support of two important Republican senators: Trent Lott of Mississippi, where half of the DD-21's would be built, and John W. Warner of Virginia. With Bush's inauguration, Lott will resume his duties as Senate majority leader and Warner will continue as chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee. There is also wide agreement that the Navy must remake itself to meet the new, if less clear, challenges of the post-Soviet era. And many military experts say that mission must focus not on the blue seas but on the ``green waters'' closer to shore. ``In the wake of the end of the Cold War, we recognized that the big naval battles on the open sea are not likely,'' said Danzig, who will leave his post as Navy secretary this month. ``The more relevant issue is to be able to project fire power from the sea to the shore. DD-21 would be the first destroyer designed specifically to perform that mission.'' The DD-21 would serve that mission in several ways, its defenders say. First, it would be stealthier. Propelled by electric engines, it would be quieter than existing ships. It would also have a narrower inverted-V hull designed to avoid detection by radar or sonar. Second, it would carry far more firepower than existing destroyers, hauling at least 120 cruise missiles and 1,500 5-foot-long ``bullets'' for its two 33-foot-long guns. Those guns would be able to hit targets 100 miles inland, four times as far as guns on most destroyers. And with its more efficient electric propulsion system, it would be able to stay at sea longer without refueling. The Navy also wants the ship designed to operate with a crew of just 95, instead of the 325 sailors aboard existing destroyers. The sharp reduction would be made possible by several innovations: Electric drive would mean fewer moving parts and less maintenance; rust-resistant paint would require less scraping and repainting; meals prepared in advance would end the need for squads of potato-peelers and soup-stirrers. With its lower fuel costs and smaller crew, each DD-21 would save the Navy $30 million a year, Danzig contends. The smaller crew would also help the Navy with its recruiting problems. So would the fact that the ship, with smaller engines and larger hull, would give sailors more spacious living quarters, with six-bed ``staterooms'' rather than cramped, 40-bed bunkrooms. But all that sounds too good to be true, critics of the program contend. More important, Danzig, a leading champion of the program, will soon be out of office, making the ship even more vulnerable, some Navy officials say. Danzig insists the program will be sustained. If testing proves that the ship can do what it is designed to do, ``it will be quite apparent that this is just a good idea,'' he said.

Navy commanders overseeing an investigation of the suicide attack on the destroyer Cole in Yemen in October have recommended that neither the ship's captain nor crew members be punished, even though they failed to follow certain security guidelines, officials said on Sunday. The recommendation raises the question whether any American commanders will ultimately be held responsible for the Cole bombing, which killed 17 sailors, wounded 39 others and very nearly sank one of the world's most powerful warships. The recommendation was made first by the naval commander in the Persian Gulf and endorsed by the commander of the entire Atlantic Fleet. It overturned the initial findings of an investigative officer who had concluded that the effects of the attack might have been mitigated if the Cole's captain had adhered to security measures, the officials said. In reviewing those findings, however, the commanders argued that the Cole's captain, Cmdr. Kirk S. Lippold, made defensible decisions to revise some of those measures and to skip others. They concluded that none of the required measures would, even in hindsight, have stopped two suicide bombers from steering a skiff packed with explosives to the side of the Cole and detonating it, the officials said. The Cole, for instance, did not have an Arabic speaker aboard when it pulled into the Yemeni port of Aden to refuel on the morning of Oct. 12, as required by security guidelines issued by the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the officials said. Lippold also decided against having officers stand watch on the bridge, assigning them instead to the quarterdeck. Nor did he order the crew to prepare fire hoses that could have been used to repel attackers, the officials said. Since the crew believed that the skiff was part of a flotilla of harbor boats instead of a hostile boat, such precautions would not have made a difference, the officials said. ``You've got to weigh the performance of the crew against the outcome,'' a senior officer said. ``And had they done everything, it would not have changed the outcome.'' The Navy's investigation focused narrowly on actions aboard the Cole itself, but its basic conclusion, first reported in The Sun of Baltimore on Saturday, will focus greater attention on the decisions by commanders in the U.S. Central Command that resulted in the Cole's stopping to refuel, at only a moderate level of alert, in a country known as a haven for terrorists. Senior officials said last week that Secretary of Defense William S. Cohen planned to order a new review of accountability beyond the Cole. He decided to do so after a broader investigation by two retired commanders found significant shortcomings in security throughout the region. That investigation _ led by Adm. Harold W. Gehman of the Navy and Gen. William W. Crouch of the Army _ did not set out to assign blame for the Cole attack. Some Navy officials have questioned whether the Cole was left vulnerable when it arrived at Aden. Even if there had not been a specific warning of a terrorist attack, there had been general warnings, and Yemen was considered insecure enough that the American Embassy there was closed as a security precaution on the day the Cole stopped to refuel. ``We didn't have the kind of information that could have positioned him to deal with the threat,'' one Navy officer said, referring to Lippold. The new review being ordered by Cohen could assign responsibility to senior commanders in the gulf region, but while the services each have systems in place for establishing accountability, there is no clear mechanism for reviewing the actions of regional commanders. Traditionally, the Navy has been vigorous in holding a ship's captain responsible for anything that happens on board. The Cole's failure to follow basic guidelines for protecting the ship from attack _ in the view of the senior admirals reviewing the investigation _ did not reflect lapses in judgment or a general laxity toward security, the officials said. Instead, they concluded that Lippold made deliberate revisions that were reasonable and defensible, the officials said. The initial inquiry, led by a captain in the Navy's 5 Fleet in Bahrain, found that the crew had failed to carry out nearly half of 62 security steps outlined by the Joint Chiefs of Staff to protect ships from terrorist attacks. Many of those, such as providing sailors standing watch with night-vision goggles, were deemed irrelevant, but the investigating officer concluded that roughly 10 others constituted critical lapses, including the positioning of the officer on watch on the quarterdeck and not the bridge, the officials said. The investigator's conclusions, completed last month, were overruled first by the naval commander in the gulf, Vice Adm. Charles W. Moore, and then by the commander of the Atlantic Fleet, Adm. Robert J. Natter. The commanders concluded that the investigator's conclusions took security guidelines too literally and did not account for the captain's discretion. One senior official said that while the Cole's crew may not have done everything by the book, its performance fell within an ``expected range'' of performance, in the commanders' view, and thus did not warrant punishment. On Friday, Natter forwarded his recommendations to Adm. Vern Clark, who as chief of naval operations, is the service's senior officer. Clark could reverse the findings yet again, but the officials indicated that he is not expected to do so. ``If you have a small boat carrying out a suicide attack,'' one official said today, ``there's not a lot you can do to stop it.''

The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, Jan. 8: In its first two decades of independence, the West African nation of Ghana was an archetypal political disaster, brought low by successive coups and dictatorships, corruption and near total economic collapse. Today, Ghana is a welcome African example of legitimate democracy and successful economic reform. In an unusually peaceful transfer of power, a civilian government that grew out of a military regime has accepted an election defeat and surrendered power to the opposition. John Kufuor, an Oxford-trained lawyer and businessman, and the leader of Ghana's opposition New Patriotic Party, was sworn in as president Sunday. He defeated John Atta Mills, the incumbent vice president, in an election widely viewed as free and fair. President Jerry Rawlings, the charismatic former flight lieutenant who has dominated Ghana for nearly 20 years, stepped down after reaching a constitutional two-term limit as elected president. Few would have predicted this turn of events when Rawlings seized power in a coup in 1981. At the time Ghana was a wreck and millions of people had left the country in search of work. In the two decades since, in close cooperation with the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, Ghana emerged as a model for free-market innovations in Africa, and now spends five times as much on education and health as on its military. Ghana still faces formidable challenges _ continued corruption, low prices for its main exports, cocoa and gold, and high prices for imported oil. Moreover, Ghana is located in the heart of one of Africa's least stable regions, with nearby Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea consumed by war and smuggling, and Ivory Coast in decline. Rawlings is not the only West African leader to surrender power in the past year. In Senegal last March, President Abdou Diouf, who had held power for 20 years, graciously bowed out after losing an election to the opposition leader Abdoulaye Wade. Together these two countries have shown that not all the news of Africa need be bad. The key to success in Ghana has been creative and enlightened cooperation between international lenders and local officials, combined with Rawlings' shrewd effort to tame the military and redirect it away from politics. Nigeria, the region's powerhouse, which is now making its own difficult transition from military rule to democracy, can learn from Ghana's achievement. Kufuor has said he will introduce a South African-style truth commission to investigate Ghana's violent political past. There are risks in probing deeply into past political crimes. But some form of public accounting for the criminal abuse of power can be a deterrent to future crimes, and thus a source of stability.

As the manhunt continues for seven prison escapees wanted in a police officer's death, authorities are looking into possible security lapses that may have set the stage for the prison break. Mac Stringfellow, chairman of the Texas Board of Criminal Justice, says lapses by prison guards may be to blame for the escape at the medium-security Connally Unit. ``Obviously, policies and procedures were not followed,'' Stringfellow told the San Antonio Express-News for Monday editions. ``If those procedures are followed, an escape cannot occur, but when you get lax, get complacent, this is what can result.'' Stringfellow made the remarks as the board prepared to meet Thursday. The Texas Department of Criminal Justice was scheduled to present a report on the escape at the meeting. ``The problem at the Connally Unit I certainly don't believe is systemic,'' Stringfellow said, ``but prudence requires that we take a look at the operation in all our prisons.'' In the escape, the inmates took 14 revolvers, a shotgun, a rifle and more than 200 rounds of ammunition after overpowering guards. They later amassed dozens more weapons in a sporting goods store robbery on Christmas Eve, during which Irving police officer Aubrey Hawkins was shot to death. As authorities try to determine the cause of the escape, police and prison officials hope a $200,000 reward will help them recapture the seven fugitives. ``We hope the high reward money will entice those people who have been assisting them in traveling and hiding,'' prison spokesman Larry Todd said. ``We believe these are the same people who helped them make good on the escape.'' The fugitives _ two convicted murderers, two armed robbers, a child beater, a serial rapist and a burglar _ have been on the run since Dec. 13. Authorities believe the group is hiding out in the Dallas-Fort Worth area. The reward doubled Saturday when $100,000 was offered by Bond Jumper, an online company that seeks to help capture people who fail to appear in court after being charged with a crime. There's also a possibility that one of the seven escapees might break ranks and offer to help the authorities to avoid the death penalty, said Tory Caeti, a criminology professor at the University of North Texas. But he said that could be a risky proposition. ``Anybody in this group who shows they are breaking away is in trouble,'' Caeti said. A Saturday night broadcast of the crime TV show ``America's Most Wanted,'' featuring a story on the escapees along with a toll-free number for sightings, yielded 132 tips. Authorities were working to follow up on those calls, Todd said. ___ On the Net: Irving Police Department: http://www.irvingpd.com/ Texas Criminal Department of Criminal Justice: http://www.tdcj.state.tx.us/ Bond Jumper: http://www.bondjumper.com/

the navy finished its investigation on the attack of "uss cole" in yemen last october. the results will be made paubl tomorrow. we know the results tonight. here's abc's john m wethy. a ship that had won commendations for being vigilant during port visits in the mediterranean seemed to be anything but vigilant when it steamed into yemen's port of aden. navy investigators have found the captain, commander kirk lippold, and his crew failed to take about a dozen required steps to protect the ship. there was no officer on the bridge to coordinate lookouts, no orders to identify and keep the track of small boats near the ship, no measure to divert a small boat if it seemed suspicious, and no audiotape in arabic to warn a boat away. the navy's investigating officer has concluded if all of these steps had been taken, it "may have prevented or mitigated the attack." but various admirals up the chain of command concluded just the opposite, even if all of these step hz been taken, they probably would have not stopped the terrorists. it now seems likely commander lippold, the cole's captain, will not be disciplined but others will still be in trouble. defense secretary cohen ordered another inquiry to see if some of the admirals who reviewed the investigation might bear some responsibilities themselves. john m wethy, abc news, the pentagon.

China's government on Tuesday rejected newly published documents vividly describing how Chinese leaders split over the crushing of the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, suggesting that the papers are fake. ``Any attempt to play up the matter again and disrupt China by the despicable means of fabricating materials and distorting facts will be futile,'' Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao said in a statement issued early Tuesday morning via the official Xinhua News Agency. The crackdown was ``highly necessary to the stability and development of China,'' Zhu said. He said the ruling Communist Party's ``correct conclusion'' about the 1989 protests would not change. It was the first official reaction to the papers, which were purportedly smuggled out of China by a disaffected civil servant and published over the weekend. Beijing has long argued that the protests were an anti-government rebellion that needed to be crushed to safeguard economic growth and Communist Party rule. It has ignored calls for an investigation into the bloody crackdown, in which hundreds were killed, and sought to silence victims' relatives who have demanded redress. Initially, the government had no comment Monday about the documents released in the United States, and China's wholly state-run media did not report them. But despite the blackout, news of the papers quietly leaked into China via the Internet, foreign radio broadcasts and word of mouth, stirring the beginnings of debate. The documents detail conversations among late Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping, who ordered the Tiananmen crackdown, and other Communist leaders. They are said to be based on never-before-published minutes of secret high-level meetings, Chinese intelligence reports and records of Deng's private phone calls. The civil servant who provided the documents describes himself as a Communist Party member sympathetic to reformers. They appear in ``The Tiananmen Papers: The Chinese Leadership's Decision to Use Force Against Their Own People.'' It was published by Public Affairs. The papers indicate that Deng ordered the Tiananmen crackdown out of fear that demonstrators could topple the Communist regime. They reveal deep-seated paranoia that the protests were controlled by unknown anti-communist conspirators. They also expose anxiety by the party's top leaders that the more than 1 million demonstrators gathered at Tiananmen Square could demand their arrest. If genuine, scholars who translated and published the papers said, the documents offer a rare glimpse into the motivations and fears behind the communist leadership's decision to order troops into Tiananmen Square.

The U.S. military needs to devote much more time and money to combat the threat of terrorist attacks, a Pentagon commission that has been investigating the attack on the destroyer Cole said Tuesday. The Oct. 12 attack, which killed 17 sailors and injured several dozen others in the Yemeni port city of Aden, ``demonstrated a seam in the fabric of our efforts to protect our forces,'' the report said. That phrase and others in the 10-page unclassified summary of findings released Tuesday afternoon seemed to reflect a deliberately detached, impersonal, written-by-committee tone. There was no immediate indication of what findings are in a separate 138-page classified report. More importantly, perhaps, there was no sign Tuesday of who will bear the ultimate responsibility for failing to prevent the attack. It had been expected that the findings released Tuesday would not address individual culpability, a point that Defense Secretary William S. Cohen reiterated at an afternoon news conference. Asked if he were concerned that the omission of a finding of blame would make the public think a ``whitewash'' was going on, Cohen noted that separate inquiries on the issue of responsibility were under way, and that their findings would be given to him before he left office with the Clinton administration. Cohen declined comment when he was asked if he thought that the destroyer's skipper, Cmdr. Kirk S. Lippold, had done everything he could to protect his vessel. The secretary said he did not want to ``prejudge.'' The broad-brush findings released Tuesday included this passage, ``The level of competence with which units execute force protection must be the same level for which primary combat skills are executed.'' The Pentagon was to post the report Tuesday afternoon on its Web site, www.defenselink.mil. Cohen's remarks Tuesday were anticlimactic, since it had been known that officers overseeing the investigation had recommended that neither the Cole skipper nor any crew members be punished even if shipboard errors were visible in hindsight. But whether Lippold will ultimately be held accountable was still uncertain Tuesday. Initially, an investigating officer concluded that the attack might not have been as disastrous if Lippold had adhered more strictly to security guidelines. There was no Arabic speaker aboard when the Cole pulled into the port of Aden on the morning of Oct. 12, for example. And Lippold had decided against having officers stand watch on the bridge, stationing them on the quarterdeck instead. Nor did the skipper order the crew to prepare fire hoses to repel attackers. Even if fire hoses had been ready, they might not have made a difference, since the men on the skiff used in the attack had managed to insinuate their craft into the harbor flotilla. Another inevitable consideration is the general difficulty of preventing an attack if the attackers are willing, indeed determined, to sacrifice their lives. ``You've got to weigh the performance of the crew against the outcome,'' one senior officer said this week. ``And had they done everything, it would not have changed the outcome.''

The USS Cole bombing that killed 17 sailors exposed a ``seam in the fabric'' of the U.S. military's anti-terrorism regime but it can be strengthened by improved training and intelligence, a panel reported Tuesday. Calling terrorism a ``pervasive and enduring threat'' to American military forces abroad, the panel appointed by Defense Secretary William Cohen spelled out a series of mostly organizational changes to deter and mitigate terrorist attacks. The panel, known as the Cole Commission, found the Navy and other military services generally react to terrorism rather than focusing efforts to detect and deter terrorist threats before they can be carried out. ``We must get out of the purely defensive mode,'' the report said. The Pentagon's various offices and agencies must improve their coordination in order to ``truly gain the initiative over a very adaptive, persistent, patient and tenacious terrorist,'' the commission said in a 10-page report. The commission, headed by retired Navy Adm. Harold Gehman and retired Army Gen. William Crouch, also produced a classified 138-page version that was not released publicly. The panel did not attempt to assess who aboard the Cole or at higher levels in the Navy or the Pentagon could be faulted for failing to stop the attack, which occurred while the Cole was refueling in Aden harbor. No one aboard the Cole attempted to stop the attacking boat, which was a small harbor craft that sidled up to the Cole and detonated a load of explosives. The issue of blame was the focus of an internal Navy investigation, which has been completed but not publicly released. On Monday, a senior defense official said Adm. Vern Clark, the chief of naval operations, has decided that neither the captain nor the crew of the Cole should be punished. Clark, the final arbiter in the matter, endorsed the determination made last week by Adm. Robert Natter, commander of the Atlantic Fleet, that no punishment is deserved, said the defense official, who is close to the deliberations and who discussed the matter on condition of anonymity. Others, higher in rank than the Cole's captain, could be held accountable. Cohen plans to order a separate accountability review to determine whether military officers responsible for U.S. operations in the Persian Gulf area can be faulted for shortcomings such as inadequate intelligence warnings of threats from terrorists, officials said. In an interview Tuesday with a group of reporters, Navy Secretary Richard Danzig said he could not discuss the matter because Clark had not yet made public his decision. Danzig said, however, that he was pleased the matter would be concluded before he leaves office Jan. 20, since ``this happened on our watch.'' He said he had not seen Clark's written decision. The Navy planned to announce the result of its investigation of the Cole bombing this week or next. The probe sought to determine circumstances of the attack and what ``force protection,'' or preventive measures, the captain ordered the crew to take. Because the Cole's captain, Cmdr. Kirk Lippold, did not carry out all of approximately 60 planned actions to ensure the ship's protection while on a refueling stop in Yemen's Aden harbor, some believed he would be punished and his career ruined. Instead, Clark supported Natter's determination that Lippold had done what could have been reasonably expected under the circumstances and that he was not given necessary information about the terrorist threat in Aden, a major port at the southern tip of the Arabian peninsula. Clark and Natter also believe that even with security measures in place as prescribed, the attack would not have been prevented, officials said. As the Cole took on fuel in Aden harbor, a small boat sidled up to the 505-foot destroyer. Explosives aboard the boat were detonated and ripped a hole 40 feet high by 40 feet wide in the Cole, damaging it so severely it almost sank. Senior Navy officials, including Natter, praised Lippold and the crew for having acted heroically to save the ship. The nature of the attack was unprecedented, although the threat was not unimaginable. The military's written guidelines on terror threats state explicitly that harbor craft of the sort that approached the Cole ``require special concern because they can serve as an ideal platform for terrorists.'' The guidelines say fire hoses should be ready for emergency use and personnel should be briefed on using them for repelling boarders, small boats and ultralight aircraft. On his own Lippold, decided not to prepare for using fire hoses, another senior defense official said, also speaking anonymously. Lippold apparently believed that fire hoses would not strengthen the ship's defenses. Some crew members said after the bombing that they saw the small boat approach the Cole and assumed it was yet another harbor craft providing trash disposal and other services. No one on the Cole challenged the craft as it approached. The Navy officer who conducted the Cole investigation, whose name has not been disclosed, found that the attack might have been prevented or minimized if Lippold had ensured that all preventive actions were taken. But Natter disagreed, and Clark endorsed Natter's view, the official said. Clark has determined that no negative report related to the Cole attack should be placed in Lippold's personnel file, the official said. ___ On the Net: Cole site: http://www.spear.navy.mil/ships/ddg67/ Navy site: http://www.hq.navy.mil/natops/

The rest of the world has always known more than the Chinese people have about what happened in Beijing on June 4th 1989. The government has never given a full account of the suppression that day of pro-democracy demonstrations on Tiananmen Square. But now some Chinese citizens are finding out the facts anyway. They have been reading, largely on the internet, secret documents smuggled out of the country by a Communist Party official, and published in the United States. As the World's Odlon Cousen reports from Beijing, the government is not at all pleased. Chinese officials today lashed out at the Tiananmen papers, saying they are part of a foreign plot to destabilize China. Foreign Ministry Spokesman Ju Bong Zhao said, any attempt to disrupt China by the despicable means of fabricating materials and distorting facts will be futile. But when pressed, Ju refused to say that the hundreds of documents themselves are fakes. Instead, he emphasized what he calls the necessity of the crack down. Ju said that the past decade of relative prosperity, in his words, proves that prompt measures taken at the time were necessary for China's stability. The Tiananman papers purport to show how Lee Pung, now number two in the Chinese government distorted facts and reports to Chinese leaders, leading to the violent crack down that followed and benefiting his own political ambitions. Many Chinese consider Lee Pung the main culprit behind the crack down, they call him by the nick name, the Butcher of Beijing, though not in public. The Communist Party official who reportedly smuggled the papers out of China admits that he is trying to weaken the position of Beijing's hard-liners. Owe Leschell, one of the three Americans scholars who helped to publish the book says that nevertheless, the man and the papers he provided can be trusted. Clearly any time you are dealing with any documents from China, you have to understand there is a political motive and this case is no exception. We understand very clearly what that motive is, mainly to sort of detonate the lockjam in political reform by beginning to clarify history on the subject of what happened in 1989. We could not discern any other sort of hidden political motivation that would cause us to be suspicious. But the book's call for reforms has angered Chinese leaders. As the governments spokesman today was attacking the book as foreign interference, he stressed that the Communist Party is now unified behind President Jiang Zemin. The spokesman did not mention the power struggle among those who want to succeed Zheng next year. Chinese leaders are exploiting the ongoing anti-corruption campaign to jockey for power. Andrew Nathan, one of the Editors of the Tiananman papers, says reformers could try to use the book's revelations for their political gain. People are grabbing corruption vulnerabilities of their enemies and of the followers of their enemies. It's a little bit like the special prosecutor law in the United States and like the so-called of cabinet nominees. If you can find anything to get somebody with, you get them. Indeed, the book is been published in an environment of almost daily corruption cases and high-level staff changes inside the Communist Party. Like the power struggles depicted in the Tiananman papers, today's battles are between reformers and hard-liners. Co-editor Andrew Nathan says he doesn't expect the book to give the reformers the upper hand, at least not immediately. I certainly do not think that a single book or any single thing is going to just crack the walnut and make China become a democracy or something like that because the system is just too robust and strong, but I do think that this will put a lot of pressure on the regime, that it's going to create a lot of pressure to actually answer the question of well, what about Tiananman, was that a mistake, was it correct, show us the evidence. China has never responded satisfactorily to the first two questions, what about Tiananmen and was that a mistake? But the Tiananmen papers may provide answers to the third, why were things done that led to the deaths of hundreds of people and the silencing of the calls for democratic reforms in China. For the World, this is Odlon Cousen in Beijing.

It's been 16 years since he managed to break out, but convicted rapist Roy Wayne Bevan, the longest-sought fugitive from a Texas prison, still remembers the euphoria _ and the panic. ``It's like running in the blind,'' Bevan recalled in an interview last week with The Associated Press. ``You don't know really what's out there. You're just running and hoping for the best.'' Bevan's capture in 1995 after 10 years reinforced Texas' reputation as a state that keeps its 150,000-plus inmates locked up and hunts down those who flee. Until Dec. 13, when seven prisoners stormed out of the Connally Unit in south Texas, 2000 was shaping up as a single-digit year for escapes, with just nine. Those seven joined only one other fugitive currently on the Texas books, an inmate under surveillance in Mexico. The seven, believed responsible for the Christmas Eve killing of a policeman in the Dallas area, have a $200,000 bounty on their heads and are the subjects of a nationwide search. Bevan was careful to distinguish himself from the recent escapees. ``I don't like the violence,'' he said. ``That wasn't my thing. I was trying to get away and trying to start over.'' Bevan slipped out of the Coffield Unit, near Palestine in east Texas, on Feb. 15, 1985. In his decade on the loose, the former oilfield worker learned the importance of remaining disciplined. He never called relatives, for example, figuring authorities would be monitoring the telephone lines. ``My mother was living at the time. She died when I was on the run. I didn't even know about that until I was locked back up,'' he said. Once outside the prison, Bevan, now 44, carefully sought work. He'd go to a service station and offer to work for half-price for a day for cash. He went to a big city _ a learning experience for a country guy. He bought a phony ID card on the street. He grew a beard. He let his hair grow. ``Every day you gain confidence,'' he said. But even after maintaining the charade for years, knowing that someone was always hunting for him was ``like a little ghost on your shoulder,'' he said. Meanwhile, prison system investigators were connecting with an established intelligence network _ state fugitive task forces _ and local, state and federal law enforcement agencies. That's what finally tripped up Bevan, who was calling himself ``Jesse D. Waight.'' After ``Waight'' was convicted in Minnesota of sexually assaulting a child, an FBI investigator matched his fingerprints to those of the man missing from the Texas prison. On Sept. 29, 1995, at a home in Osseo, Minn., Bevan was captured. He wasn't entirely surprised. ``I knew I would be eventually,'' he said. ``One morning I went out and everybody had surrounded the house. I knew the time was up.'' ___ On the Net: Texas Department of Criminal Justice: http://www.tdcj.state.tx.us/ Irving Police Department: http://www.irvingpd.com/

An exiled former president and 16 others have registered to enter Peru's April 8 presidential vote, kicking off the race to replace disgraced former President Alberto Fujimori. Political parties rushed Monday to register their candidates with the National Elections Board before a midnight deadline. Among the hopefuls was front-running opposition leader Alejandro Toledo, a U.S.-trained economist whose powerful speeches rallied tens of thousands of Peruvians in protest of Fujimori's authoritarian rule. Another was exiled former President Alan Garcia, whose populist 1985-90 administration was marred by hyperinflation, guerrilla violence and corruption. Garcia, a fiery orator who still faces arrest here, fled to Colombia in 1992 amid corruption charges. His left-leaning Aprista party has been pressuring the courts to halt legal action against him. Election officials registered of 10 candidates from established political parties. Meanwhile, candidates from seven new parties were accepted conditionally. Fujimori called elections for this April, cutting short his third five-year term to only one year, after the release in September of a video showing his fugitive ex-spy chief Vladimiro Montesinos apparently bribing a congressman. Fujimori later fled to Japan, his ancestral homeland, amid ensuing corruption scandals, and was replaced by interim President Valentin Paniagua, whose mandate is to hold clean election in April and turn power over to a new government next July.

Droughts caused by global warming could set off a biochemical process in northern soils that would release large amounts of carbon dioxide into the air and possibly speed up changes in the climate, researchers reported Thursday in the journal Nature. The researchers, led by Dr. Chris Freeman of the University of Wales in Bangor, said the increase in droughts predicted by some climate models could abruptly activate a dormant enzyme in moist, peaty northern soils, triggering decomposition of their organic matter. This decay would release large amounts of carbon dioxide, a ``greenhouse gas'' thought to cause global warming. The soils are believed to hold some 460 billion tons of carbon, or about 60 percent of the amount already in the atmosphere as carbon dioxide. ``It is an enormous reservoir that potentially can be released into the atmosphere as another climate change factor,'' said Dr. Robert G. Wetzel, a professor of biological sciences at the University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa. Wetzel, who was not involved in the research, said the mechanism identified by Freeman ``would accelerate the release from this enormous pool.'' But he and other scientists cautioned that the possibility outlined in the study depends on predictions that are based on uncertain climate models. Dr. Sandra Brown, an ecologist, said, ``The best predictions I've seen say it will be a warmer and drier climate.'' But Brown added, ``I always worry when I see these papers making broad extrapolations across the entire world.'' Brown, of Winrock International, a private environmental organization in Arlington, Va., is a member of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, an organization of hundreds of scientists that was created by the United Nations. Still, several scientists said that the findings would make it even more urgent to try to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases. Late last year at The Hague, negotiations on a worldwide treaty to reduce global warming collapsed in part because of disagreements over the role of natural ecosystems like forests in sopping up carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and reducing warming. The new study, said Dr. Peter Frumhoff, an official of the global environmental program at the Union of Concerned Scientists, who was present during the negotiations at The Hague, emphasized ``the need to be taking a precautionary approach and moving forward quickly with reducing atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases.'' The organization backs efforts to limit emissions of the gases. Other scientists did not dispute that assessment but said the results demonstrated the great uncertainties in models of the global carbon cycle. As if to underline that point, a second study published in the same issue of Nature suggested that under some circumstances higher amounts of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere could inhibit decomposition of material in grassland soils, presumably enhancing carbon storage there. Any direct implications for the earth's climate will not be known until that effect can be studied longer, said the authors of the study, who include Dr. Shuijin Hu of the department of plant pathology at North Carolina State University and Dr. Christopher B. Field, a plant biologist at the Carnegie Institution of Washington, at Stanford University. ``It reminds us that there are still surprises,'' said Dr. Bruce A. Hungate, an ecologist at Northern Arizona University who was not involved in the work, ``that we don't completely understand all the dynamics that control atmospheric CO2 (carbon dioxide) concentration.'' About half of carbon emissions are eventually absorbed by natural carbon sinks in the oceans and on land. The rest remains in the atmosphere. On land, the carbon is stored when plants grow, die and decay into organic matter in the soil. When that organic matter finally decomposes, nutrients like nitrogen are released in forms that another generation of growing plants can absorb, and the carbon escapes into the atmosphere as carbon dioxide. In experiments at the University of Wales, Freeman and his co-authors _ Dr. Hojeong Kang, now at the University of Wisconsin, and Dr. Nick Ostle, now at the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology at the Natural Environment and Research Council in England _ studied the biochemistry of northern peatland soils, which make up about 6 percent of the earth's land, including wetlands, tundra and other moist soils. The team found that within those soils, the action of a single enzyme called phenol oxydase could trigger a sudden decomposition of the stored organic matter. But the enzyme is normally dormant because the water in those soils keeps them free of oxygen, which the enzyme needs to function. But frequent droughts could dry the soil and let oxygen in. The enzyme would then begin decomposing organic matter; it would also break down compounds that inhibit the activity of other enzymes, leading to a sort of chain reaction. Hu and Field's research found that increased carbon dioxide levels over several years led indirectly to a starvation of microbial activity in grassland soils, lowering decomposition rates. But both scientists said that over much longer periods, the effect could also reduce plant growth, canceling any enhancement of the soil's ability to store carbon. ``The ecosystems are big players, but they're almost certainly not going to save the day and result in a situation where emissions cuts aren't necessary,'' Field said.

Cuba's top diplomat flew to Africa and the Middle East this week to recruit international help in the country's fight to topple the four-decade-old U.S. trade embargo. ``Our primary priority for 2001 is to continue battling against the North American blockade,'' Foreign Minister Felipe Perez Roque said in an interview Tuesday before taking off on his first international trip of the year. The United States now is nearly alone in trying to force a political change on the communist island by isolating it from the rest of the world. Perez Roque wants other countries to help pressure the U.S. government into dropping the sanctions imposed at the height of the Cold War. Cuba has the backing of the United Nations, where 167 General Assembly members voted last year to condemn the 1962 embargo on all trade between the United States and Cuba. Opposed were the United States, Israel and the Marshall Islands. There were four abstentions. Overwhelming condemnations of the embargo by U.N. member states have been the norm for several years. Now, Cuba says, anti-embargo sentiment is growing inside the United States as well. ``The Cold War is over,'' Perez Roque told The Associated Press. ``There is a broad (American) consensus in favor of the normalization of relations.'' Last year, there were increased moves in the U.S. Congress to at least ease sanctions to allow U.S. farmers to sell their products to the Caribbean nation. After several failed attempts by embargo foes, Congress passed a law that would allow American food to be sold to Cuba for the first time in 40 years. But Cuba complained that accompanying financing restrictions made sales all but impossible. During visits last year to Africa, the Caribbean and Latin America, Perez Roque emphasized support for Cuba's efforts to end the embargo. Now, Cuba wants to ensure that international opposition to the embargo doesn't weaken, especially among European Union members that joined last year's U.N. vote to criticize the island for ``continued violation of human rights and fundamental freedoms.'' All countries in the Western Hemisphere save Mexico and Canada cut ties with Cuba in the early 1960s under U.S. pressure. But relations have been gradually restored as pragmatic interests replace ideological ones, especially after the former Soviet Union's collapse in late 1991. Now, El Salvador and the United States are the only nations in the Western Hemisphere without some kind of diplomatic links with Fidel Castro's government.

The seven convicts who escaped from prison systematically overpowered guards and staff over a 2 1/2-hour period, eventually driving out the rear exit unchallenged in a prison vehicle, according to a report released Thursday. The convicts, who escaped Dec. 13 from the Connally Unit near Kenedy, are charged in the Christmas Eve slaying of an Irving police officer and are still on the loose. In an hour-long report, Gary Johnson, director for the institutional division of the Texas Department of Criminal Justice, outlined the events leading up to the escape. Inmates able to take 11 employees and three prisoners hostage in a maintenance storage room binding them with duct tape and plastic ties and threatening them with homemade weapons, the report said. The report also noted that some of the prison employees held hostage in the maintenance area managed to free themselves and pull a fire alarm. However, the security officers responsible for responding to the fire alarm did nothing to investigate after they called the maintenance room and the phone was not answered, the report said. The report also said that an officer who had seen several of the inmates unsupervised in the maintenance area did not alert anyone. ``In retrospect, the events fit together like a puzzle. We just didn't fit them together fast enough to keep the offenders from escaping,'' Johnson said. Before the report was released, department spokesman Larry Todd said, ``We don't have any secrets, and we're not hiding anything. We want to be as candid as we possibly can.'' The gang stole work clothing, a pickup truck and firearms and left a note saying ``You haven't heard the last of us yet.'' Other letters left behind by three of the convicts complained of the ``tyranny of the Texas prison system'' and called for a revolution, The Dallas Morning News reported Thursday. The breakout, robbery and killing triggered an extensive manhunt and touched off complaints about guard pay and staff shortages in the nation's largest prison system. Although security at state prisons has been stepped up since the breakout, Todd said events leading to the escape were unusual and would not be repeated at other prisons. State Rep. Judy Haley, who represents the district southeast of San Antonio where the prison is located, said the breakout happened because legislators have not sufficiently funded prison security and guard training. Haley is among the lawmakers who want to increase guard pay. ``If we were where we need to be, something like that would not have happened,'' she said. Starting pay for a Texas prison guard is about $18,000, or 43rd in the country, said Brian Olden, executive director of a prison employee council within the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees. Pay for veteran officers was boosted to slightly more than $28,000 last year, but that is still behind a national average of about $34,000, Olden said. The proposed state budget announced Wednesday includes $42 million for prison guard pay raises promised last summer but doesn't include any new money for additional raises or staff. ___ On the Net: Texas Department of Criminal Justice: http://www.tdcj.state.tx.us

The escape of seven convicts from a maximum-security prison comes under scrutiny Thursday with the release of a state report detailing the getaway. The Texas Department of Criminal Justice was expected to identify who is to blame and how the escape was carried out Dec. 13 at the Connally Unit near Kenedy. ``We don't have any secrets, and we're not hiding anything. We want to be as candid as we possibly can,'' department spokesman Larry Todd said. ``The report certainly points out some flaws that will be corrected, be it human error or a communications fault.'' The breakout has touched off complaints about guard pay and staff shortages in the nation's largest prison system. The gang broke out of prison by overpowering 10 civilian workers, a guard and a supervisor in the maintenance shop where they worked. They stole work clothing, a pickup truck and firearms and left a note saying ``You haven't heard the last of us yet.'' Other letters left behind by three of the convicts complained of the ``tyranny of the Texas prison system'' and called for a revolution, The Dallas Morning News reported Thursday. The group is charged in the Christmas Eve shooting death of a police officer during a holdup at a sporting goods store in Irving. A gun taken from the prison was found at the store, police said. The robbery has triggered an extensive manhunt. Although security at state prisons has been stepped up since the breakout, Todd said events leading to the escape were unusual and would not be repeated at other prisons. State Rep. Judy Hawley, who represents the district southeast of San Antonio where the prison is located, said the breakout occurred because legislators have not sufficiently funded prison security and guard training. Hawley is among the lawmakers who want to increase guard pay. ``If we were where we need to be, something like that would not have happened,'' she said. Starting pay for a Texas prison guard is about $18,000, or 43rd in the country, said Brian Olsen, executive director of a prison employee council within the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees. Pay for veteran officers last year was boosted to slightly more than $28,000, compared with a national average of about $34,000, Olsen said. The proposed state budget announced Wednesday includes $42 million for prison guard pay raises promised last summer but doesn't include any new money for additional raises or staff. The Texas prison system has 23,622 guards, with a total of 2,595 open positions. Olsen said the Connally Unit was 22 officers short the day of the escape. ___ On the Net: Texas Department of Criminal Justice: http://www.tdcj.state.tx.us

in texas today, state officials said that in the wake of the great escape a month ago, several prison guards may lose their jobs. the seven members of the connelly gang, so named for the congressionally prison from which they escaped, are still on the loose. today the department of criminal justice released its report on the escape. there were several missed opportunities to catch the men in the process. a prison guard walked into the maintenance shop the inmates had taken over and didn't notice anything wrong. prison guards who were taken hostage managed to pull a fire alarm but no one investigated. et cetera let's take "a closer look." here's abc's mike von fremd. there was furious finger pointing because of the escape. one of the guards, alejandro marroquin stormed out of the news conference. he was held hostage by escapees and says the report ruined his reputation. they are making us look bad. now i can't go look for a job anywhere, because they will say, "he was part of the connelly seven." the mother of the police officer who was allegedly slain by the escapees says the blame goes much higher than the guards. they are certainly accountable, but so are you and so is the governor. it starts at the top. prison officials admit they were ultimately outsmarted by one of the most clever gang leaders in texas history -- george rivas, who was serving 17 life sentences. this store clerk was held hostage by rivas on christmas eve. what is it like looking into george rivas' eyes? it was terrifng to look at him. i don't know if it was because he had a gun, or it was just because he controlled whether i was going to live or die that day. he wants to keep his identity a secret because he remembers what george rivas said to him. be calm and do what we say and no one is going to die. but if we have to shoot one person, everyone is going to die. while the clerk was being held hostage, he heard shooting outside. it was officer aubrey hawkins being killed. i had my eyes closed with my head against the wall. they had just left. i was just praying to god that they wouldn't come back in when we heard the gunshots. during the robbery the gang members called rivas "hefe" -- spanish for boss. dr. richard coons was rivas' court-appointed psychiatrist. george has charisma. george is a leader. he is methodical. he is a manipulator. when rivas we inside the sporting goods store, he passed himself off as a security guard. he said, "i need all of the employees to look at these photos of someone who has been shoplifting. and the sporting good employees fell for it. i think he was very cunning and very, very precise. he knew exactly what he was doing. he is not just a normal criminal. a difficult criminal who's now been on the run for 30 days. mike von fremd, abc news, dallas.

Texas prison officials have issued a report following the escape of 7 inmates. The men have been on the run since December 13. Janet Hymlek reports from Austin. The 7 escapees were housed at the maximum-security Connoly Unit prison near San Antonio. According to the report, they made their move while working in the maintenance area at lunchtime. There the men overpowered a supervisor and bound and gagged him and then did the same to 9 other employees and 3 inmates. Some of the men then put on uniforms of the Down-Correctional officers, which allowed them to walk around pretty freely. After that, they overtook an officer in a security tower and when they got to a back gate a guard failed to ask them for ID's. This helped them to steal a truck and make their getaway. Prison officials largely blamed the escape on the officer at the back gate, but guards say they are being scapegoated. They say prison officials have not taken proper precautions to protect their safety. For NPR News I am Janet Hymlek in Austin.

Arguably no one in the Clinton administration, aside from the President had more impact on the formulation of US foreign policy then Sandy Berger. As national security advisor, Burger consulted closely with Mr. Clinton on foreign hotspots, western alliances, and global trends. Sandy Berger is now moving out of his office and making way for his presumed successor Condoleezza Rice. Mr. Burger is in New York today, so do you have everything packed up and set to go yet? Haven't started to pack yet, I guess that's the last think I will do on the 19th. I guess in a way that really doesn't surprise me but I wonder if you and Ms. Rice have at least crossed paths in the hallways. Have you made time to speak with her at all? Oh yes, I have spent quite a time with Condy Rice. I have been on the other side of the transition. She's met with many people on our staff, had briefings on a range of issues, and we've had a very good and cooperative relationship. Well, as you have been briefing her, I assume that during that time, you have had a little bit of a chance to reflect on your own foreign policy accomplishments and that of the administration as well. I want to start off with some of your proudest moments. Can you reflect kind of publicly for us for a moment? I think when President Clinton came into office at the end of the cold war, it really was incumbent on him to design and define a new role for America in a globalized world. We enlarged NATO to include new members. I am very proud of the fact that we took a stand as NATO to stop the carnage in the Balkans and now Milosevic has tumbled and southeast Europe can join the mainstream of European democracy. I am proud of the work we did to bring China into the international trading system and in so doing open China to competition, which I think will have a profound effect ultimately on change and the nature of life there for the Chinese people. I am very proud of the role the President has played in peacemaking from the Good Friday agreement in Northern Ireland, which he just visited a few weeks ago, to the Balkans, to the Middle East, and even in Africa, in Ethiopia, Eritrea or so. I think this has been a very productive and important period. You mentioned Africa, as return inevitably, of course to what your greatest disappointments that might have been. I wonder if some of them you could point to Africa or tell us in terms of those things that you might perhaps be even be haunted by in the years to come? Would you point there first? Well, if you are in fact referring to Rwanda, I think, President has said that he wishes that we had done more, it was a very difficult situation. It was one that erupted very quickly. It was not particularly clear what international presence could do. But having said all that, I think we should have done more. But I am also proud of what we have done in Africa. This is the first American President who's traveled to Africa twice, and we are at the forefront of the efforts to try to stop the terrible epidemic of AIDS in African, which has devastated the continent, so on the one hand I regret that we were not able to do more to prevent or mitigate that tragedy, but I do feel good about our engagement with Africa in the last 8 years. You are talking about the genocide in Rwanda. I am thinking as well about in 1998 after our own embassies were bombed in Kenya and Tanzania, the United States launched cruise missiles against Afghanistan and Sudan. After which, as you know, there were numerous reports suggesting that we hit the wrong target in Sudan, that the factory that we struck was not ammunitions factory. Do those revelations, which have occurred on several fronts, do they upset you? No they are wrong. The fact of the matter is that the facility that we struck in Sudan was unquestionably associated with production of chemical weapons or with chemical weapons. It was part of a military-industrial corporation that Osama Bin Laden had an interest in, a financial interest in and helped it finance. Have we been able to prove unconditionally that the owner, for instance of that factory in Sudan was linked with Osama Bin Laden and have we been able to prove that in fact it was ammunitions factory? We never said it was ammunitions factory. We said it was a factory that was associated with chemical weapons and there is unmistakable analytical and chemical analysis of chemicals that were found in and around that facility before we bombed it that were, they have only one known purpose and that is for use as chemical weapons. Want to I ask you some broader questions in terms of United States foreign policy now as you prepare to leave office, President Clinton shortly after the end of the cold war during which time American foreign policy interests could be really fairly simply expressed. Started talking about a different kind of foreign policy, I mean at that time during the cold war, obviously we had a powerful enemy in the USSR. Over the past 8 years foreign policy has been a little more ill defined and there are some critics who say this is a reflection of the fact that there is disorganization and unclear thinking about the world. What do you think about that? Is it possible now these days to have a clearly defined US foreign policy in a world where the United States does not have a clear enemy? Well, I think it is possible. I think, it is more challenging, but as you said Lisa, we lived for 50 years in which we defined the world in quite simple terms. We knew what we were against. We were against communism and our policy was to contain it, and that worked brilliantly in Europe and ultimately the Soviet Union collapsed. When that paradigm was applied by the United States to Southeast Asia, or Central America, or Africa, sometimes it proved to be not particularly the right way to look at a situation. I think now we have entered a new global era in which forces of technology, economic forces are necessarily integrating the world and a challenge that America has at a time of enormous strength, militarily and politically and economically, is to harness those forces of globalization in ways that promote the peace and prosperity of the United States and of other democracies. Final question for you Mr. Burger, as you prepare to leave your job, I wonder how you have liked it? Well, I think it's been a wonderful opportunity and I have been very grateful to the President for letting me serve. I think that this is a extraordinary time for the world as the world goes more interdependent, closer together in many ways and yet the old demons of ethnic hatred and ambition and aggression still exist, and I think what we've had to do during this period is to try to define a new role for America at the end of the cold war. We have tried our best to do that. We tried to make good decisions that advanced peace, that advanced American prosperity, and advanced our relations, and our alliances and I believe that, where as in 1992 when we came here, Time magazine wrote the United States was in an irreversible decline. We would no longer be a world power. I think we now leave America as a proscenia of its power and influence politically, militarily, and economically and I feel quite good about that. Outgoing National Security Advisor Sandy Berger, thanks for your taking the time to speak with us. Thank you Lisa.

And with that sports update for us, here's Steve Schy. Olympic and soccer officials have agreed that the men's soccer competition at the'2004 Athens games will remain the same as in Sydney with sixteen teams and only three players above the age of 23 allowed on each team. The President of football's world governing body Seb Blador and International Olympic Committee President Juan Antonio Samaranch say they were pleased with the way last year's Olympic soccer tournament in Sydney went. That competition attracted more than a million spectators. In a statement Thursday, the officials said the number of teams will increase from 8 to 12 in the women's tournament. The IOC also announced the 2008 Olympics will be held the last week of July and first week of August. Beijing, Istanbul, Osaka, Paris and Toronto are the five finalists to host the games. Argentine football legend Diego Maradona has arrived in Italy and was greeted by tax police, informing him that he is being investigated for alleged tax fraud of almost 25 million dollars. The Italian news agency reported that around 20 officers met Maradona at the Womm airport Thursday evening, they discreetly asked the soccer star to accompany them to an office where the papers were served. The 40 year old Maradona led Argentina to the 1986 World Cup trophy and was voted alongside Brazilian legend Pele, as the greatest footballer in the twentieth century just last month. He signed a document saying he had been served with the claim and then left, clearly upset by the turn of events. Michael Vick, who helped turn Virginia Tech from just another college football team into a title contender in just two seasons, has decided to leave school for the National Football League. Vick made the announcement Thursday at a news conference in his hometown Newport News Virginia. He called it one of the hardest decisions he has ever made. Vick also said his family is important to him and that he wants to take care of them. The decision to turn pro represents a change of heart for Vick, who said last month that he planned to return to Virginia Tech. Since arriving in Blacksbird three seasons ago and spending the last two with starting Quarter back, Vick has led the Hokies to consecutive eleven win and one loss seasons, a berth in last year's National Championship game and a Gator Ball berth this season. He is projected by many analysts as the first pick overall in the draft, a consideration that might have convinced Vick to enter the NFL. It is true. It will be in the world being the number one draft all. Comes from where I come from but you know just to be considered in the and have a to tell you that this is a great chance that you can be number one throughout the I am glad. Friday is the deadline for all under classmen to declare their draft intentions. The President of a public company building the Olympic village for the Athens 2004 games, says he has been forced to resign because of a disagreement with the Greek government. Georgios Ian Anites, head of the organization of Labor Housing, resigned on Thursday. That could further delay construction of the village that will house more than 17,000 athletes and officials. Construction is scheduled to begin in mid-March and had been expected to be completed by February of 2004. It was the third high level Olympic related resignation in two months and the latest in a string of shakeups since Jiana Angelopolis Daskalaki was brought in as the head of the organizing committee last May to bolster Athens' flagging preparations. Greek Premier Castes Semites has also fired a Minister with Olympic oversight and a senior executive at the 2004 Organizing Committee during the past four months. International Olympic Committee officials say they are confident Athens has made up for lost time, but they also stress that Greece can't afford any more delays. A spokesman with the code of arbitration for sport in Lausanne, Switzerland, says disgraced French cyclist Richard Verank has lodged an appeal against his nine month ban for doping. Lawyers for Verank have ten days to submit their written arguments. And that's a look at sports this hour. I am Steve Schy.

Yemenis probing the attack on the USS Cole have put a number of questions about the ship's security to U.S. investigators, a weekly Yemeni military newspaper reported. The paper, 26 September, which hit newsstands in Aden late Thursday, did not say when the Yemenis made their request. Last month, the United States and Yemen signed an agreement calling for closer cooperation between U.S. and Yemeni investigators. The accord was hammered out after Yemen initially balked at allowing the Americans much access to Yemeni suspects in the Cole bombing, saying it was a matter of sovereignty. U.S. and Yemeni officials could not immediately be reached for comment on the 26 September report. The newspaper said the Yemenis were particularly curious about a peddler believed to be an American they say was allowed to board the Cole while it was stopped in the Suez Canal en route to Yemen's Aden harbor. Yemeni authorities wanted details of conversations the man had with sailors aboard, what the sailors bought from him, any questions he asked sailors while aboard and precisely where on the ship he was allowed, said the paper, which did not identify its sources. The report said that peddler was a ``clown'' who ``behaved like the English comic actor Charlie Chaplin.'' It was the first report of an outsider being allowed on the Cole before the explosion, and could raise further questions about U.S. security. The Cole, refueling in Aden on the way to the Gulf to support the U.N. embargo against Iraq, was attacked Oct. 12 by a small boat that maneuvered alongside the destroyer and detonated a load of explosives. The blast killed the two bombers as well as 17 U.S. sailors. The attack prompted an internal U.S. Navy inquiry on whether any Americans should be held responsible for security lapses. That review has been completed but not made public, while a separate inquiry seeking to draw lessons from what happened to the Cole concluded the U.S. military must take more aggressive precautions against terrorists. Yemeni officials have said they are preparing to try at least eight Yemenis detained on suspicion of helping plot the attack and that they continue to pursue other suspects. No trial date has been set, but Prime Minister Abdul-Karim al-Iryani said last month that he expected it would be held in the last half of January. During the past week, additional security forces have been arriving in Aden, where the trial is expected to be held, sources close to the investigation have told The Associated Press. A high-level security meeting was planned for Saturday in the capital, San'a, according to the sources. Some of the questions 26 September said had been put to the Americans appeared to be part of the attempt to build cases against Yemeni suspects for the upcoming trial. 26 September said the Yemeni investigators also asked: _how many people knew about the Cole's route and who told them; _whether any abnormal telephone calls were received aboard the ship during the Cole's journey from the Suez Canal to Aden's harbor; _what was found at the Cole blast site after the U.S. destroyer was towed out of Aden's harbor; and _for details from U.S. explosives experts on the bomb materials and quantity, as well as results of lab tests on materials and samples sent to the United States. The paper also quoted Deputy Interior Minister Motahar Rashad al-Masri as saying authorities still were looking for three people in connection with the bombing. Among them was Mohammed Omar al-Harazi, who earlier reports said issued orders to Cole plotters in Yemen by telephone from the United Arab Emirates. The newspapers gave no details on the other two being sought. Al-Masri also confirmed that five people have been arrested in connection with explosions Jan. 1-2 in Aden. Blasts went off at an Anglican church compound, near the official Yemeni news agency, at a hotel and along two major roads. Only one injury, reportedly minor, resulted from the blasts. Three of the five suspects have provided detailed confessions of their involvement, al-Masri was quoted as saying. There has been speculation in Yemen the small bombings were part of an attempt to disrupt preparations for the Cole trial.

Scientists at a private company in Massachusetts announced today that they have succeeded in cloning a rare Asian ox called a gaur. The animal was born on Monday but died 48 hours later. NPR's Joe Parker has more. The private company Advanced Cell Technology of Wischter, Massachusetts has been engaged in several efforts to clone rare or endangered species. The idea is to use the same techniques as Scottish scientists used to create the cloned sheep "Dolly". But instead of risking a pregnancy in an endangered species the scientists sought to find another species that could act as a surrogate mother. The gaur was a natural choice since it is closely related to domestic cows. The scientists used skin cells that had been taken from an adult male gaur that died five years ago, inserted the DNA from those cells into a cow egg and implanted the resulting embryo into a cow's womb. The gaur calf appeared healthy when it was born last Monday but died 48 hours later of a common infection. Joe Parker, NPR News, Washington.

This is The World, a co-production of the BBC World Service, PRI, and WGBH in Boston. I am Lisa Mullins. A plan was announced today to raise the Russian nuclear submarine 'Kursk', next summer, almost a year after it hit the bottom of the Barents Sea following a mysterious accident. The Kursk Foundation, an international consortium led by the governments of Russia and The Netherlands says it can do the job safely if it can secure the funding. The BBC's James Rogers was in Brussels for today's announcement. He says there are two main reasons for raising the Kursk. Obviously the first one is to recover the bodies that remain. There are still the bodies of more than 100 sailors trapped in the vessel since it sank in the Barents Sea in August of last year. Secondly, there is a longer-term threat and that's an environmental threat. The Kursk Foundation says that the nuclear reactors, there are two on board, are safe for the time being but that the corrosive effects of seawater could in time lead to radioactive leaks into the ocean, which obviously could have devastating consequences on the fishery and the environment in general. That's the danger of leaving it down there. I would think there are risks of bringing it up as well. I mean this is a huge submarine. That's right. The size of these things is really very surprising. In fact one of these Russian nuclear submarines is about the length of one and a half football fields. Now, it's lying in something over 300 feet of water. So if you can just visualize it being turned on its end, it would stick out of the sea about 200 feet. It is a huge submarine and nobody is pretending that this, if it goes ahead, is going to be an easy operation. There are any number of complications, one of which is that as part of the submarine is stuck in sand and clay on the seabed. So that's going to give resistance once they do try to lift it. Second problem, as I have already mentioned, two nuclear reactors on board. They are not going to be able to attach any lifting gear to any parts of the vessel nearby the nuclear reactors for fear of provoking an accident. So it is going to be extremely difficult. We had heard a few months ago about some theories on how the submarine could be raised. One of them was using balloons. Is that what the foundation itself plans on doing? That's not what they are proposing. Their rescue attempt involves three vessels essentially. One is a diving ship with two diving bells. The second is a huge platform with very large cranes on it, perhaps a platform of the type more usually used for oil and gas exploration. And a third vessel involved is what the rescuers describe as a giant offshore barge and the plan is to lift the submarine off the seabed, attach it to the underneath of this barge and then take it to the Russian naval port of Mamansk. How much is it going to cost and where is the money coming from? Well, that's one of the problems that they are facing so far. The Kursk Foundation today were mentioning a figure of 70 million dollars. They have already presented their rescue plans to the European Union. They are hoping to get some funding from them. But they are going to be looking for worldwide funding because as they see it, the potential environmental consequences make this an international problem requiring an international solution. It might be worth reiterating that the Kursk was such a prestigious submarine and really held a high position in terms of the Russian Navy. So this is something that Russians themselves are still dealing with even now. Very much so because obviously we have read a lot in the last few years about how many parts of the Russian Naval fleet is essentially rotting and is poorly maintained. The Kursk certainly wasn't part of that. It was only launched in the 1990s and to a great extent was the pride of the Russian submarine fleet. So it was a great sense of shock when this went down. It was also for men in the Russian Navy it was a great source of pride to serve in the submarine fleet, and then of course you have the feelings of the relatives to take into account. There are still more than 100 bodies which haven't been recovered, so at least raising the vessel and being able to return the bodies of the dead sailors to their loved ones might go some small way towards redressing their grief. The BBC's James Rogers speaking to us from Brussels. Thank you for the update James. Thanks very much. My pleasure.

Former President Reagan broke his right hip in a fall at his home Friday afternoon and will have surgery Saturday morning, his spokeswoman said. Reagan, who turns 90 on Feb. 6, was taken from his Bel Air home by ambulance to St. John's Health Center, where he was resting comfortably, said his chief of staff Joanne Drake, who described it as ``just a simple fall.'' The former president's wife, Nancy, was taken with him to the hospital in the midafternoon, Drake said. ``He is fully alert, in good humor and in stable condition,'' she said in a statement. Drake said the surgery would likely involve installing a pin in the hip. Reagan disclosed in November 1994 in a passionate letter to the American people that he has Alzheimer's disease. The nation's 40th chief executive faded from public view a short time later and has been rarely seen outside his home. He discontinued going to his Century City office in 1999 but still made trips to parks and enjoyed strolls on the Venice Beach boardwalk with his Secret Service contingent. Drake said that Reagan's children were notified, including eldest daughter Maureen, who has been undergoing cancer treatments at the same hospital since Dec. 11. An estimated 250,000 people, mostly elderly, break their hips every year in the United States, according to the National Institutes of Health. Only one-quarter of hip fracture patients make a full recovery and 20 percent die within a year, according to the American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons. Half of patients need a cane or walker, and 40 percent go from hospital to a nursing home. Reagan was born in 1911, in Tampico, Ill., and acquired the nickname ``Dutch'' as a baby. After college he began a career as a sports broadcaster, then jumped into acting in the 1937 film ``Love is on the Air.'' His movie career took off with the role of halfback George Gipp in ``Knute Rockne, All-American,'' permanently associating Reagan with the coach's exhortation to ``win one for the Gipper.'' Reagan served multiple terms as president of the Screen Actors Guild starting in 1947 and then ran for California governor, beating Democratic incumbent Edmund G. ``Pat'' Brown in the 1966 election and winning re-election in 1970. Reagan unsuccessfully challenged President Ford to be the Republican candidate in 1976, then emerged as the GOP frontrunner in 1980 against President Carter. At 69, Reagan was the oldest man ever elected president on Nov. 4, 1980. On March 30, 1981, Reagan was leaving a Washington hotel after addressing labor leaders when a young drifter, John Hinckley, fired six gunshots at him. A bullet lodged an inch from Reagan's heart, but he recovered fully. He was re-elected in 1984 by an even greater margin, carrying 49 states in defeating Democrat Walter Mondale. Reagan generally exhibited good physical condition during his public life. During his visits his Santa Barbara County ranch, he chopped wood and rode horseback. His deteriorating health forced sale of the ranch, however. The statement released by Drake on Friday evening asked that well wishes be sent to the Reagan Foundation, 40 Presidential Dr., Simi Valley, CA 93065. ___ On the Web: Hip information from American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons: http://orthoinfo.aaos.org/ The Reagan Foundation: www.reaganfoundation.org/

President-elect George W. Bush said Friday that he planned to review and possibly roll back some of the most ambitious initiatives that President Clinton has taken in recent days, including regulations that put nearly 60 million acres of the nation's forests off limits to development. ``I understand the Western mentality, and I want the Western mentality represented in this administration,'' Bush said of his own land use policies. In an interview, he emphasized that ``we've got lawyers looking at every single issue, every single opportunity'' to reverse actions Clinton has taken in the waning weeks of his presidency. He also described what could well become a new, tougher approach toward Russia, limiting aid for its conversion to a market economy, and he elaborated on several other foreign policy issues. Previewing one of the most closely watched decisions he will face in his first month in office, he signaled that he was inclined to use an executive order to stop the flow of American money to any international organizations that provide abortions in foreign countries. ``Organizations that promote abortions are organizations I don't want to support'' with American taxpayer dollars, Bush said. Bush's remarks came in a 75-minute interview in the family room of his renovated farmhouse here, followed by less formal conversation during a 90-minute tour of his ranch and a hike up a limestone canyon to his favorite waterfall. Along the way _ stopping at moments to admire the middle fork of the Bosque River rushing through his land or to point out a buzzard _ the man who will become the 43rd president of the United States on Jan. 20 also talked about his legislative priorities, his inaugural address and the diplomatic troubles he anticipates with Moscow and Beijing over his plans to deploy a national missile defense system. Bush was dismissive of the Clinton administration's eight-year-long use of direct financial aid to Russia, part of a broad Western effort to coax the country toward the development of a market economy. He suggested he would try to stop the money _ except for that used to dismantle nuclear weapons _ until Vladimir Putin, the Russian president, cleaned up corruption and enacted far-reaching economic and legal reforms. ``It's hard for America to fashion Russia,'' Bush said. ``It just seems like to me that we don't want to be lending money and/or encourage the lending of money into a system in which the intention of the capital is never fulfilled,'' he said. ``The intent of the capital was to encourage entrepreneurship and growth and markets.'' According to the General Accounting Office, the United States has spent roughly $2.3 billion since 1992 promoting democracy, the rule of law and market reforms in Russia, but the annual disbursements have tailed off steeply since the Russian financial crisis of 1998. The International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, institutions in which the United States is the largest single shareholder, have issued loans to Russia over the same period worth approximately $30 billion. Taken together, Bush's comments amounted to a sketchy road map for his first 100 days in office. By making it clear that he would rigorously review Clinton's environmental orders and suggesting he might reverse the Clinton administration's position on aid to family planning groups working overseas, he was embracing some favorite causes of his conservative base, especially the Western states he called ``that big swath of red on the map'' _ a region of contiguous states he swept as he took the presidency in the narrowest of victories. In the case of reversing Clinton's forest policy, which was made final this month, after years of painstaking review and public comment, Bush would face many legal restraints. In the interview he acknowledged that his lawyers would have to look carefully at what options were open. His comments on Russia, if converted into policy, could lead to a fundamental change in the way the United States seeks to influence the behavior of a nation that was once its chief superpower rival _ and it risks heightening suspicions in Russia of how America is leveraging its economic and military power. In the interview, Bush also made the following points: _ He said his inaugural address, which he hopes to keep to 12 minutes, would carry the message that ``we can be a unified America.'' But he insisted that this theme was not the product of his slim victory in the Electoral College, and his loss of the popular vote. _ Bush said he planned to quickly introduce his plan to cut taxes by $1.3 trillion over 10 years as a single bill, perhaps modifying it to deepen the tax cuts in the first few years to spur a slowing economy. Asked if he was willing to negotiate the size of his proposed tax cut with a sharply divided Congress, he shot back: ``The answer is no. I think it's the right number.'' _ He suggested he might be willing to pick up on Clinton's framework for a deal with North Korea to control its production and export of missiles but said it must include provisions to ``verify that they are upholding their end of the agreement.'' If North Korea no longer threatens its neighbors, he said, he would ``take a look'' at reducing American troops on the Korean Peninsula, but only in consultation with South Korea and other Asian allies. _ Bush acknowledged that the economic sanctions imposed on Iraq since the Persian Gulf War have so collapsed that ``they resemble Swiss cheese.'' But while he was critical of Clinton's handling of Iraq, he declined to say what tools he might use to pressure Saddam Hussein. _ The president-elect said he may have erred in commenting on the Federal Reserve's action early this month to cut interest rates, and suggested that to preserve the Fed's independence he would not publicly evaluate its actions as president. ``I kind of read the feedback and tended to agree with it, frankly,'' he said of the criticism he received for enthusiastically backing the half-point cut in short-term rates. Throughout the conversation Bush looked relaxed. He was clearly enjoying a day off puttering around his ranch, brewing coffee for visitors and interrupting the conversation repeatedly to admonish his two friendly but occasionally disobedient dogs, Spot and Barney. But he leaned forward and turned intent when the subject turned to his choice for attorney general, former Sen. John Ashcroft, R-Mo., a religious conservative who he said he knew ``could end up being a lightning rod'' for criticism. He said he expected that Ashcroft's confirmation hearings, which begin Tuesday, would be focused on the designee's comments on civil rights, his fierce opposition to abortion and comments he made supporting leaders of the South in the Civil War. ``They are going to dig up every word the guy uttered,'' Bush said. ``He's going to get to explain them. He explained many of the words he uttered to me.'' The president-elect professed to be unfazed by the withdrawal last week of his choice for labor secretary, Linda Chavez, who had failed to tell the Bush transition team that she had once had an illegal immigrant live in her home and perform occasional house chores. Bush would not say that he had been misled by Chavez, but noted, ``She said she made mistakes,'' and he seemed to agree with that assessment. Bush described his cabinet as ``a very strong group of folks,'' made stronger by their extensive experience in government. ``I'm always mindful of what Sam Rayburn told Lyndon Johnson when he first saw the Kennedy administration,'' he said, referring to the famously gruff former speaker of the House. ``He said, `Gosh, I just wish one of them had run for sheriff.' And that's why I'm very comfortable with an Ashcroft or a Norton. They not only ran for sheriff, they ran for statewide offices.'' Talking like a professor of management at Harvard Business School _ which he attended decades ago _ he said he was working hard to turn his cabinet choices into a cohesive team that is accustomed to his own style. In his two visits to Washington in recent weeks, he noted, he was ``spending time with the folks, just watching everybody interact and letting them see how I respond and my style. I want them to see the decision-making process and how it works.'' He wanted, he insisted, no yes-men or yes-women. ``Here's loyalty,'' he said. ``Loyalty is somebody who walked into my office and says, `Here is my opinion,' or `I hear you are thinking this way. I don't agree with you.''' He made it clear, however, that once he had chosen his path, he expected his cabinet members to voice unanimous support for his decisions in public. At one point Bush said that he had cautioned his press secretary, Ari Fleischer, that at times he would withhold information so that Fleischer could truthfully profess ignorance to reporters _ hardly a new strategy for occupants of the White House. Bush recalled telling Fleischer recently, ``When I tell you you are not going to know something, you say, `Yes, sir.''' Bush made little effort to hide his interest in reversing some of Clinton's recent executive orders and rules. But he cautioned that his aides were still researching whether reversals would be legally or politically possible, noting at one point that some of his actions would require legislation and ``it doesn't take much to block action in the United States Senate,'' where there are now 50 Republicans and 50 Democrats. Bush's views on the administration's recently completed effort to block the development of roadless areas of federal lands, essentially putting those areas off limits to loggers and oil drillers, was complex. Bush himself clearly treasures his natural surroundings _ ``I love land,'' he said while driving around the 1,600 acres he acquired in 1999 _ but he instinctively bridles at the thought that the federal government would trump local officials or private landholders in deciding how that land should be used. ``What I would seek to do is to make sure that our bureaucracies were not trampling the interest of the people _ and the president himself would work with local stakeholders before takings _ such as what the president has done with the roadless areas, for example.'' The word ``takings'' is used to describe government action to limit the use of land, with minimal or no compensation. ``The concept of the federal government taking people's property without compensation is something I agree with Gale Norton on,'' he said. ``It should not. There ought to be a balance between obviously the public interest and private property. And a lot of people in my state and in the Western states feel that balance is not there.'' He reiterated his determination to drill for oil in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and said, ``People shouldn't be shocked that I'm picking somebody who agrees with me. That's what a president does.'' But he stopped short of saying definitively that he would reverse the forest regulation wholesale, suggesting he would consult with ``governors and senators and local folks'' to determine what lands should remain off limits, and what lands should be developed. ``There's going to be some property in these giant chunks of land that we can use and not damage the environment,'' he said. ``There are some in this country that have wanted zero exploration or zero activity. And I just don't think it's in our national interest to take that approach.'' He was more definitive about his opposition to federal aid for family planning groups that promote or perform abortions abroad. One of Clinton's first acts, two days into his presidency in 1993, was to sign an executive order scuttling a Reagan-era policy that prohibited these private organizations from receiving public funds. Under a compromise reached in October to avoid a confrontation between congressional Republicans and Clinton, Congress allocated $425 million for such family planning activities _ but said it could not be spent until Feb. 15. That clears the way for Bush to return to the Reagan policy, and while he said that he had not yet thoroughly reviewed the matter, he suggested he was inclined to head in that direction. He also gave a sense of his other priorities, suggesting that in addition to education reform legislation and his tax bill, ``we may be able to move a little faster on Medicare'' reforms, including prescription drug coverage for elderly Americans. But he tacitly conceded that an overhaul of Social Security, a major subject of debate in the campaign, would take time. In discussing his approach to foreign policy, both in the formal interview and on his ranch tour, Bush again said he would not allow American military forces to engage in what he called ``nation-building'' _ converting countries to stable democracies _ because it was a distraction from their main mission. That was a critical difference with Vice President Al Gore, who repeatedly cited the experience of American forces in helping remake Japan and Germany after World War II. He said allies in Europe were ``very aware'' of his desire to gradually reduce America's presence in Kosovo and Bosnia, and said Secretary of State-designate Colin L. Powell would make it clear that Washington wanted Europe ``to be the peacekeepers.'' (In fact, the United States provides less than 20 percent of the peacekeeping forces in the Balkans.) But, Bush said, ``I don't have deadlines in mind'' and ``I honor the agreements that the president has _ that our country has made. ``It's going to take a while'' to pull back, he said. He endorsed much of Clinton's core strategy toward China, using economic engagement to promote more freedom, but he seemed unable to decide whether China posed more of a threat to the United States because of its growing military strength or its internal weaknesses. ``I'm trying to figure out if your question is a trick question,'' he said with a smile. After a digression on the chaos brought about by the Cultural Revolution, he concluded, ``To me, particularly as China develops as the military power, a chaotic China would be something that should cause great concern to people in the region and to us.'' He said he was prepared for objections from Moscow and Beijing to his plan to build a national missile defense, but he insisted it should not be seen by either capital as a threat. ``We've just got to explain why we are doing what we are doing,'' he said. ``The Chinese know and the Russians know that there will be no system developed in the immediate future or the foreseeable future, is a better word, that can conceivably intercept a multiple launch'' of missiles at the United States. ``You know that. They know that,'' he said. The system's real intent, he said, was to intercept an accidental launch of one or two nuclear weapons, or to deprive ``some nation like Iran to eventually say to us, `And we've got one aimed at Israel.''' He would not discuss what kind of incentive he might offer China or Russia to accept the system, other than decreasing the size of America's own nuclear missile fleet. And how many warheads could he eliminate from America's arsenal? ``That's what we are going to find out,'' he said.

Afghanistan's Taliban rulers scored major victories against opposition forces Saturday, capturing two key districts in northern Takhar province, a Taliban official said. The Taliban seized Hajaghar and Ikhanum districts, near Afghanistan's northern frontier with the Central Asian state of Tajikistan, Abdul Wakil Omar, a Taliban spokesman in the Afghan capital of Kabul, told The Associated Press. But the northern-based opposition rejected the Taliban claim and said the ruling militia's assault had been driven back. No confirmation of the contradictory statements was available because of the remoteness of the embattled region. Hajaghar and Ikhanum are key routes from Tajikistan to opposition forces on the battlefield in northern Afghanistan. If the Taliban have captured them, it would be a severe blow to the opposition, led by ousted president Burhaunddin Rabbani and his deposed defense chief Ahmed Shah Massood. Backed by fighter planes, tanks and artillery, the Taliban said they attacked the two districts, forcing opposition troops to flee. Scores of fighters were killed. The Taliban also said they captured Hajaghar's airport, some 210 miles north of Kabul. The official said they were now trying to capture the nearby district of Dasht-i-Qala. The Taliban, who captured most of Takhar province last year in a string of victories, had lost Hajaghar and Ikhanum to the opposition in November. The Taliban are mostly Sunni Muslims and Pashtun, Afghanistan's majority ethnic group. They are fighting the opposition forces on several fronts in an attempt to capture the entire country. The opposition, made up of ethnic and religious minorities, has been squeezed into several small pockets, mostly in the country's northeast. Despite international isolation and U.N. sanctions, the Taliban have maintained a firm grip on the areas they control and are gradually expanding their rule in the country's northern regions, which once were considered opposition strongholds. The Taliban accuse Russia of arming and supporting the opposition. The opposition denies the charge and says Pakistan is backing the Taliban. The latest Taliban victories would come just days before fresh U.N. sanctions against the Taliban take effect to press the ruling militia to hand over Saudi billionaire Osama bin Laden to the United States or a third country for trial. Washington accuses bin Laden of masterminding the bombing of two of its embassies in East Africa in 1998. Bin Laden denies the charge and the Taliban say the United States has failed to give any evidence of his involvement.

A major earthquake shook Central America on Saturday, unleashing a landslide that buried hundreds of houses near San Salvador and causing major damage across the country. About 1,200 people are believed to be missing in the buried Las Colinas neighborhood just west of the capital, according to Red Cross spokesman Carlos Lopez Medina, who said 61 people were known to be dead across the country. The national police said it estimated the death toll at near 100. Salvadoran President Francisco Flores declared a national emergency and appealed for international aid, especially for experts at searching for buried victims. The 7.6-magnitude quake centered off El Salvador's southern coast also rocked Honduras and Guatemala, where two deaths were reported. Buildings swayed in Mexico City, about 600 miles to the northwest. Hundreds of rescuers frantically ripped at the earth with sticks and bare hands to reach those buried in the middle class Las Colinas area, where a 1,500-foot landslide carried away houses, cars and trees. A distraught Arturo Magana, 25, wandered about trying to find his 18-year-old brother, Jaime: ``I don't know where to dig because I don't know where the house is,'' he said. ``This is terrible. I don't think we will be able to pull out any victims; everything has been buried,'' said David Lara, a rescue worker struggling at the mass of dirt and concrete with a shovel. Lopez estimated that 300 houses had been destroyed in Las Colinas. The wall of a hospital collapsed in the southeastern town of San Miguel and 25 people were known to be dead in a small village nearby. ``There is my boy! Help me! Help me!'' wailed Carmen de Marin, a 41-year-old woman weeping beside the buried ruins of her house there. She said her 12-year-old son Jaime Ernesto Marin had stayed home to await a phone call from his father in the United States when she went out shopping shortly before the quake hit at about 11:35 a.m. By night, 20 bodies had been recovered at Las Colinas. No survivors had yet been found. News of the damage was slowed by the fact much of El Salvador's telephone service and electricity was knocked out by the quake for several hours. Only sketchy reports had arrived from many hard-hit areas. In Santa Ana, about 35 miles northwest of the capital, the 116-year-old El Calvario church collapsed, killing at least one employee and possibly others worshipping inside, according to the Rev. Robert Castro. ``The church is generally empty then, most everyone had already come and gone,'' said Castro, 46. ``We can only hope now that there weren't people inside.'' The Red Cross reported that 13 people died in nearby Sosonati. Some 200 other victims were rushed to the area hospital, which authorities weren't sure was still structurally sound. The quake was centered off the Salvadoran coast, about 65 miles southwest of San Miguel, according to the U.S. Geological Survey in Denver, Colo. It took more than an hour for some San Salvador radio stations to return to the air and telephone service remained spotty at mid-afternoon. There were cracked buildings and shattered windows across the city of 500,000. Officials at San Salvador's international airport said all flights had been halted. Most businesses in the city also were closed _ though in a surreal touch, acrobats and dancers from a touring circus marched through the streets past frightened people, using a loudspeaker to promote a coming performance. Police in neighboring Guatemala said a man and a 2-year-old girl were killed and three other people were injured when a pair of homes collapsed in the city of Jalpataua. Local radio stations reported the collapse of a church in Suchitepequez, in southern Guatemala. The quake set off car alarms and temporarily knocked out electricity, radio, television and cellular phone service all over Guatemala, but most service was quickly restored. Honduran officials reported cracked buildings in several cities, but there were no reports of injuries. A 1986 earthquake centered near San Salvador killed an estimated 1,500 people and injured 8,000.

Jelena Dokic, upset about the way her family has been treated in Australia, will play instead for her native Yugoslavia in the Australian Open. The switch came as Dokic's outspoken father, Damir, complained for the second year in a row that the Australian Open draw is rigged against his daughter. She must face defending champion Lindsay Davenport in the first round Monday. The 17-year-old Dokic, Australia's top player, is unhappy with the way her family has been portrayed by the media in her adopted country. Tournament officials confirmed Sunday that she asked to play for Yugoslavia rather than Australia on the WTA Tour this year. ``We will accept this and amend the Australian Open 2001 draw according,'' said Geoff Pollard, Tennis Australia president. ``It's a sad situation, but we're focused on running the Australian Open for the next two weeks.'' Damir Dokic questioned the computer draw that gave his daughter such a tough opening match. ``The draw is fixed just for her,'' he told the Sun-Herald of Sydney. ``If it is not, the country should protect its own player. ... She feels that no one here likes her.'' Damir Dokic was expelled from last year's Wimbledon and U.S. Open, and he has been banned by the WTA Tour until March because of a series of outbursts. Pollard dismissed Dokic's allegation regarding the draw. ``That's just the way it came out,'' Pollard said. ``The draw was done publicly in front of players and media. He should know that all draws are done the same way. It's the luck of the draw _ you get good draws, you get bad draws. She has had good ones and bad ones before.'' Dokic said she plans to move from Sydney to Florida and feels betrayed by Australia. ``If anybody has been attacked the way I am in the media, they would feel the same way,'' she told the Sun-Herald. ``I am playing under the Yugoslavian flag, not for Australia.'' Dokic received a Yugoslav passport in November after traveling on an Australian passport for four years. She and her family left Yugoslavia six years ago.

Rescuers using sticks and their bare hands dug for survivors in buried homes after a powerful earthquake struck El Salvador and Guatemala, killing at least 81 people and leaving hundreds more missing. About 1,200 people were unaccounted for in the buried Las Colinas neighborhood just west of El Salvador's capital and at least 79 people are known to be dead across the country, a National Emergency Committee announced. Two people died in Guatemala. Police and rescuers in El Salvador put the toll from Saturday's 7.6-magnitude quake at a slightly higher figure of around 100 confirmed dead and said they feared the number could rise as excavations continued. ``It was like a wave of dirt that covered us,'' said Emilio Renderos, 60, a watchman employed in Las Colinas. ``It was horrible.'' Rescuers fought to pry into the 1,500-foot landslide that had buried an estimated 300 homes in the middle-class neighborhood. By night, 20 bodies had been recovered at Las Colinas. No survivors had yet been found in the mass of dirt and concrete. The quake shattered buildings in several cities in this Central American nation of 6 million. Smaller aftershocks were felt in San Salvador late Saturday, but there was no immediate information on their magnitude. Centered off El Salvador's southern coast, the temblor also rocked Honduras and Guatemala. Buildings swayed as far away as Mexico City. Salvadoran President Francisco Flores declared a national emergency and appealed for international help to search for survivors. A distraught Arturo Magana, 25, wandered about in Las Colinas, trying to find his 18-year-old brother, Jaime. ``I don't know where to dig because I don't know where the house is,'' he said. In the southeastern town of San Miguel, the wall of a hospital collapsed and 25 people were known to be dead in a small village nearby. The U.S. Agency for International Development said it had three people in El Salvador before the quake and that five more were en route. As soon a suitable airport is open, the agency plans to send a planeload of relief supplies, including medical kits, blankets and plastic sheeting, from a stockpile in Miami. The quake knocked out El Salvador's telephone service and electricity for several hours, impeding the spread of news. Only sketchy reports had arrived from many hard-hit areas. In Santa Ana, about 35 miles northwest of the capital, the 116-year-old El Calvario church collapsed, killing at least one employee and possibly others worshipping inside, according to the Rev. Robert Castro. The Red Cross reported that 13 people died in nearby Sosonati. Some 200 other victims were rushed to the area hospital, which authorities weren't sure was still structurally sound. The quake was centered off the Salvadoran coast, about 65 miles southwest of San Miguel, according to the U.S. Geological Survey in Denver, Colo. It took more than an hour for some San Salvador radio stations to return to the air and telephone service remained spotty at mid-afternoon. There were cracked buildings and shattered windows across the city of 500,000. Officials at San Salvador's international airport said all flights had been canceled Police in neighboring Guatemala said a man and a 2-year-old girl were killed and three other people were injured when a pair of homes collapsed in the city of Jalpataua. Local radio stations reported the collapse of a church in Suchitepequez, in southern Guatemala. The quake set off car alarms and temporarily knocked out electricity, radio, television and cellular phone service all over Guatemala, but most service was quickly restored. Honduran officials reported cracked buildings in several cities, but there were no reports of injuries. A 1986 earthquake centered near San Salvador killed an estimated 1,500 people and injured 8,000.

Trapped in a bathroom, her legs pinned under concrete blocks, a young servant named Maria Antonia cried out for her brother and for the child she used to care for. Above the tons of dirt covering her, firefighters worked furiously to free her, hammering away concrete to create a narrow hole and feeding an IV tube through in a desperate rescue effort following the earthquake in El Salvador. ``She's calm, but she said she can't feel her legs,'' said Jhonny Ramos, a rescue worker who descended into the pit to comfort her. The woman, whose first name only was known, said she was touching the leg of another servant _ who was lying near her, dead. Maria Antonia was one of only three survivors found by Sunday morning among the hundreds of homes buried by the quake-triggered landslide in the Las Colinas neighborhood of Santa Tecla, about six miles west of the Salvadoran capital. The child she asked about _ like hundreds more people reported missing _ may be buried somewhere beneath. Digging through the rubble to reach her took five hours. Amid the massive destruction, it was a tiny victory: nearby, corpses, some horribly mangled, were laid out in a yard. Authorities said 79 people had been confirmed dead nationwide and another two in Guatemala. As many as 1,200 people have been reported missing in Las Colinas. Elsewhere in the middle-class neighborhood, Arturo Magana shoveled continuously _ even though he wasn't sure exactly where his crushed home was located. ``I can't leave. I can't stop. My brother is down there,'' he said. Authorities brought in soldiers and bulldozers _ but afraid the equipment would crush survivors, some residents preferred to keep working by hand. The neighborhood was flattened and buried by the Cordillera de Balsamo, the ridge that looms over Las Colinas. For years, residents had carved into the hillsides and cut into forests to clear building lots. The quake, centered off the country's coast, finally tumbled the loosened soil onto the neighborhood below. Reynaldo Maradiaga, 35, described how he started to run when the earthquake began rocking his home. ``I heard a big roar, and I saw the mountain come tumbling down over the houses,'' said Maradiaga. The wave of earth stopped three feet from his doorway. Some rescuers, like volunteer David Lara, said it would be difficult to find more survivors. ``I don't think we're going to get anyone out alive,'' Lara said. Others vowed to keep trying. ``I'm not losing hope,'' said Maria Hernandez, 26, whose aunt and 3-year-old nephew were missing. ``Only God knows why this happened. But I'm not giving up. I'm going to get them out of here.''

Peruvian ex-President Alberto Fujimori on Sunday invited investigators to come question him in Japan and said he will return home only if cleared of all corruption allegations. Fujimori said a possible homecoming will also depend on the outcome of Peru's April presidential and legislative elections. ``It will not be something for the near term,'' he said during a talk show on Japan's TV Asahi. Fujimori, who is in self-imposed exile, has been accused of secreting public money into his own bank accounts. He asked Peru's judicial authorities to investigate him in Japan. ``I am waiting for them, but strangely, they have failed to come to Japan,'' he said. ``I will cooperate fully. I believe they know that I do not have any illegal bank accounts.'' Fujimori resigned in November amid corruption scandals involving his former spy chief, Vladimiro Montesinos. Interim President Valentin Paniagua will oversee elections in April and turn power over to a new government next July. Congressional investigators said they have found no evidence linking Fujimori to Montesinos' illicit bank accounts, but they say he bears responsibility for allowing his former adviser to organize a reputed network of illicit arms dealing, money laundering and influence peddling. Fujimori has denied reports that he transferred $18 million to three bank accounts in Japan from an alleged front company linked to Montesinos. He said Montesinos had planted the allegation to discredit him. The Japanese government recently announced that Fujimori _ the son of Japanese immigrants _ holds Japanese citizenship, allowing him to stay there indefinitely. The 62-year-old former leader spoke a little Japanese at the beginning of Sunday's television program. He told the show's host that he used to eat Japanese food three times a week in Lima and had cooked sukiyaki, a popular Japanese stew.

Rescuers using sticks and their bare hands dug for survivors in buried homes after a powerful earthquake struck El Salvador and Guatemala, killing at least 81 people and leaving hundreds more missing. About 1,200 people were unaccounted for in the buried Las Colinas neighborhood just west of El Salvador's capital and at least 79 people are known to be dead across the country, a National Emergency Committee announced. Two people died in Guatemala. Police and rescuers in El Salvador put the toll from Saturday's 7.6-magnitude quake at a slightly higher figure of around 100 confirmed dead and said they feared the number could rise as excavations continued. ``It was like a wave of dirt that covered us,'' said Emilio Renderos, 60, a watchman employed in Las Colinas. ``It was horrible.'' Pope John Paul II on Sunday urged the international community to come to the aid of earthquake victims in Central America. Countries as far away as Spain and Taiwan announced plans to send rescuers and humanitarian aid. Rescuers fought to pry into the 1,500-foot landslide that had buried an estimated 300 homes in the middle-class neighborhood. By night, 20 bodies had been recovered at Las Colinas. No survivors had yet been found in the mass of dirt and concrete. The quake shattered buildings in several cities in this Central American nation of 6 million. Smaller aftershocks were felt in San Salvador late Saturday, but there was no immediate information on their magnitude. Centered off El Salvador's southern coast, the temblor also rocked Honduras and Guatemala. Buildings swayed as far away as Mexico City. Salvadoran President Francisco Flores declared a national emergency and appealed for international help to search for survivors. A distraught Arturo Magana, 25, wandered about in Las Colinas, trying to find his 18-year-old brother, Jaime. ``I don't know where to dig because I don't know where the house is,'' he said.

To Rod Laver's eye, tennis was more attractive back when he was becoming the only player to win the Grand Slam twice. ``There was more variety in the strokes and the rallies that we played,'' Laver said Sunday after he helped christen the newest court at the Australian Open. When rackets were wooden and he was young, the 62-year-old Laver said, ``Seems like the drop shot became very important because you just couldn't do so much with the rackets.'' which were wood when he started out, the 62-year-old Laver said. For recreational tennis players, he added, ``it used to be when you had a tiny wooden racket it would come back and hit you in the eye. You'd say, `I don't like this game.''' Aside from racket technology, ``I get the feeling that the courts are quicker, maybe the ball is quicker,'' he said. The 15,000-seat center court at Melbourne Park was named Rod Laver Arena last year in honor of the Australian who won the four major tournaments of tennis in both 1962 and 1969. And on the day before this year's open started, Laver hit with rising Aussie star Lleyton Hewitt to christen the 10,000-seat, retractable-roof Vodafone Arena. Laver, who has 11 titles from Grand Slam tournaments, said he did not expect today's younger players to dominate tennis the way Pete Sampras has, winning a record 13 singles titles at Wimbledon and the Australian and U.S. Opens. There are ``just so many young players out there that can rise up and play their best tennis,'' he said. He mentioned U.S. Open champion Marat Safin, a 20-year-old Russian now No. 2 in the rankings, and Hewitt, a 19-year-old Australian who won last week's ATP tournament in Sydney and is seeded seventh for the Australian Open. Laver, nicknamed the ``Rocket,'' might have won more Grand Slam tournaments, possibly surpassing Sampras' total, if they had been opened sooner to professionals. As a pro, he missed the six years up to 1968. ``I don't dwell on that,'' he said. ``If you are just trophy-hunting or whatever, then maybe you could start to go back and try to analyze your career, but I was very fortunate to play some of my best tennis at the right time. ``I am very, very happy that Pete is the record holder. ... You don't see him play just average matches. He is always playing at his peak.'' Laver suffered a stroke in July 1998, and ``I think tennis is certainly one of the things that has brought my recovery back,'' he said.

First there was a blood-chilling scream from atop the mountain. Within moments, a wall of earth was crashing down onto the middle-class neighborhood of Las Colinas below. When the dust cleared, nothing was left of Las Colinas but a flat plain, its silence punctuated by the wails of the injured. As many as 1,200 people disappeared below the mass of dirt: A woman walking to the store for some eggs. A 12-year-old boy waiting at home for a phone call from his father in Kansas. Three 5-year-olds riding the bicycles they received for Christmas. Rescuers on Sunday frantically dug with earth-movers, with shovels, with their bare hands to extract mangled corpses _ and at least three people who had miraculously survived. It began at 11:35 a.m. Saturday, with a scream. Julio Antonio Ramirez, a bodyguard for a wealthy American woman who lives in a columned white mansion at the top of the hill, was standing in the yard when he heard it. The earth had begun to shake, lightly at first, but then with a sudden jolt. Someone in a house at the top of the hill let out a desperate scream, and almost simultaneously the hillside gave way in a giant explosion. Ramirez, 40, watched in awe as a wave of dust swept down from the top of the hill a half-mile into the neighborhood below. It sounded like the crash of the surf, he said. Next came silence. And then the grotesque wails of the injured. ``The cries were terrible,'' he said. ``I thought, 'this is the end of the road.''' The dust cloud was so fierce that for a half-hour Ramirez couldn't see a thing. When it began to clear, he couldn't believe his eyes. The neighborhood below was now a plain of dirt. There was no way of telling where the streets had run, where the houses had stood. All were buried below three stories of dirt. Miguel Angel Ortega, a 34-year-old importer, was already racing home. He had gone to his ranch to tend to his horses and when the earthquake stuck, his only thought was to reach his three sons and his wife. Their seventh anniversary would have been Sunday. When he arrived the dust had cleared, but it took him several minutes of wandering to figure out where his house had been. He sat down in the dirt to cry, and his gaze met that of the household's only survivor: A white husky named Lobito _ ``Little Wolf.'' ``I called him and he came running to me,'' Ortega said. ``He's all I have left. I'm alone in this world with him.'' On Sunday, Ortega sat atop what had been his swimming pool, wrapped in a blanket, his cowboy boots caked with mud. His eyes were red from crying, and he was waiting for an army crew to arrive to help dig down for his family. ``Ay, my little God. Where are my corpses? That's all I want to know, so I can bury them,'' he said. ``If I had been here it would have been better, because I would be dead.'' A few blocks away, the Rev. Peter Danaher had fled as his church crumbled around him. But the Franciscan priest from New York abandoned the ruins of his house of worship and made his way to Las Colinas. ``I looked at it and said, 'What's a few bricks and mortar? We'll rebuild. This is the real tragedy,''' he said. It was 1 p.m., and no rescuers had arrived. But they would, by the hundreds. Soldiers, pilots, firefighters, doctors. But also sales clerks, students and housewives. While soldiers formed into squads with earthmovers and jackhammers, groups of citizens dug into the earth with shovels, picks and their bare hands. ``People just came on their own,'' said Angel Palacios, 16, exhausted after 12 hours of digging but nowhere near ready to put down his shovel. The walls of his house across town were cracked and part of the roof had fallen, but when a neighbor told him about the plight of Las Colinas, Angel's father made a quick decision. ``My dad said, 'Let's go help them, because we need to thank God that we're alive,'' he said. ``We walked across town and we've been here since.'' Soon, the entire plain was a rescue zone, with groups of diggers swarming between the rapidly growing piles of dirt. Above the buzz of generators came shouts of ``stretcher!'' when a corpse was found. But even with the hundreds of rescuers pouring over the area, there weren't enough. Relatives stood vigil above what had been the houses of their loved ones, waiting for someone to come help them. Kathia Machaca, 27, collapsed onto a muddy mattress after waiting for more than 17 hours for crews to reach the house of her parents and her daughters, ages 5 and 8. Her husband, an electrician in Los Angeles, called her on her cellular phone, weeping and pleading for something encouraging about their daughters. She couldn't help him. ``I had hope when I got here, but that's gone now,'' she said. ``All that's left now is desperation.''

Former President Reagan remained hospitalized in stable condition on Sunday after undergoing surgery to repair a hip fracture suffered during a fall. Reagan, 89, was placed under general anesthesia on Saturday before a series of pins, screws and a plate were used to put the his hip back together. The surgery, originally expected to last three hours, started at 8:30 a.m. and was completed by 9:35 a.m. While he would be able to complete most of his recovery and rehabilitation at home, Reagan was likely to be hospitalized for seven to 10 more days, lead orthopedic surgeon Dr. Kevin Ehrhart said Saturday. The doctor said Reagan would need to use a walker when he regains mobility. ``The condition of the president's tissue, specifically the muscle and bone, was that of a much younger man, which obviously helps substantially with his recovery,'' Ehrhart said. Nancy Reagan has been with her husband since he was hospitalized Friday afternoon at St. John's Health Center after falling at the couple's Bel-Air home, said Joanne Drake, Reagan's chief of staff. Daughter, Patti Davis, and son, Michael Reagan, visited Saturday. Youngest son, Ron Reagan, telephoned and plans to visit his father in the hospital in a couple of days, Drake said. Reagan's eldest daughter Maureen has been undergoing cancer treatments for melanoma at the same hospital since Dec. 11. In a statement issued Sunday, President Clinton sent well-wishes to the former president and his family. ``Hillary and I are relieved that President Reagan's treatment for his injury appears to have been successful,'' Clinton said. ``Our thoughts and prayers are with the president, his wife, Nancy, and the entire Reagan family during this difficult period. We join all Americans in wishing him a speedy recovery.'' Mrs. Reagan was called before the surgery by President-elect Bush. Former President Gerald R. Ford called during the surgery while the Rev. Billy Graham sent a faxed message wishing the Reagans well. At 69, Ronald Reagan was the oldest man ever elected president of the United States. He maintained a thumbs-up demeanor for the public after a 1981 assassination attempt in which he was hit in the upper chest by a bullet. He also went through several bouts with illness _ including surgery for skin cancer, to remove a suspicious polyp and for enlargement of the prostate _ during and after his presidency. He announced in November 1994 that he had been diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease, a progressive, irreversible neurological disorder. Reagan said in a letter to the American people he hoped his disclosure would improve public knowledge about of the disease, as his past disclosures had raised awareness about cancer. ``At the moment I feel just fine,'' he wrote. ``I intend to live the remainder of the years God gives me on this earth doing the things I have always done.'' ___ On the Net: Hip information from American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons: http://orthoinfo.aaos.org/ The Reagan Foundation: www.reaganfoundation.org/

A blizzard was blowing across Red Square this month, and the wet snow was turning hairdos into spaghetti curls while putting a white veneer on the mountains of dirty snow that line the streets of the capital this time of year. Nonetheless, Vladimir Barinov, his wife and son persevered against the weather, along with about 1,000 other people, and lined up to see the preserved body of Lenin. The family was visiting from Vladivostok, nine time zones to the east. And because Barinov, age 50, had never looked upon the face that launched the Bolshevik revolution, and because his 13-year-old son, Peter, soon to enter high school, has never encountered Lenin or Leninism in the new Russian school system, ``I thought we would just stop by and see him,'' the railway worker said. The family has no political obsessions about Lenin, or really about anything. ``Our political feelings have atrophied,'' interjected Barinov's wife, who pulled tight the fur-lined hood of her jacket against the driving snow. Yet here they were, with all of their political apathy, standing on line in a blizzard to see the founder of the Soviet state who died at the age of 53 in January 1924, and whose mummy now has 77 years on the meter. When President Vladimir Putin proposed last month to reinstate the music of the old Soviet anthem as the Russian national hymn _ with new lyrics _ some leading political reformers, like Anatoly Chubais, criticized Putin's embrace of Soviet symbolism and called on him to bury Lenin once and for all. But where such a call might have once triggered a political tempest among Communists, nationalists, reformers and Soviet hangers on, this winter it provoked little reaction. The reason is that under Putin, the former KGB officer who straddles Russia's political divide by embracing the achievements, and the symbols, of the Soviet past, Lenin is more secure in his resting place on Red Square than he has been in years. Boris Kagarlitsky, a sociologist with the Russian Academy of Sciences, believes that Putin's restoration of Soviet symbols, and his defense of Lenin, does not mean that his goal is to reinvent the Soviet state, in fact the opposite. ``I think the intelligentsia seriously believed that the restoration of the Soviet anthem would somehow herald a return to Soviet methods,'' he wrote in a recent newspaper commentary. ``In reality, though, the state has restored the anthem precisely because it is not possible to restore anything else. The authorities offered up the hymn as compensation'' because ``the Soviet Union is far in the past and the point of no return was passed long ago.'' For the same reason, Kagarlitsky said in an interview, there will be no move against Lenin's body unless Putin's political fortunes plummet sharply and he uses the issue of Lenin's status to provoke a crisis as a means to distinguish himself from the Communists and their allies. Still, he added, ``I think it is quite curious that this mummy remains on exhibit.'' So does 87-year-old Ilya B. Zbarsky, a biochemist who seems to wince these days over his long association with the ``apparat science'' that made ``this sign of barbarity'' possible. ``In my opinion, Lenin has to be removed from Red Square,'' Zbarsky said in an interview. Lenin's body ``is not a symbol of modern Russian society,'' he added, speaking in halting English in the laboratory where he has dedicated most of his career to the chemistry of cell nuclei. ``It is rather a symbol of tyranny and should not be there.'' From 1934 to 1952, Zbarsky served as one of the elite Soviet scientists who worked at the top secret institute whose job it was to thwart even the appearance of mortality in Lenin's corporal tissues. His father, Boris I. Zbarsky, was a member of the original mummification team that worked furiously between March and July of 1924 to stop Lenin's decay by dipping the corpse in baths of potassium acetate and glycerine. They bleached the dark spots on his skin with hydrogen peroxide, stitched his lips and eyelids closed, and sealed up the cranial scars after Lenin's brain was removed. The equally secretive Institute of the Brain studied the shape, size and every bend and fold of Lenin's brain for years to wrest from it the secret of the genius that Soviet ideology attributed to Lenin. It is still preserved in a jar at a laboratory in central Moscow _ along with the brain of Stalin, who shared the Red Square mausoleum with Lenin from his death in 1953 until 1961, when he was taken out and buried by the Kremlin wall. Pink filters were placed on the lights to give Lenin's skin the flush of the living, and his hair was darkened a bit. When his widow visited the body for the last time in 1938, she is said to have muttered, ``He's just the same, but look how I've aged.'' Putin's arrival is better than rent control for the dozens of scientists and technicians who still attend the body in the underground chambers beneath the mausoleum. Their scientific leader is Valery A. Bykov, who has little patience for Zbarsky or for those who question what he sees as the historical importance of his task to preserve Lenin. ``We have no doubts here about what we are doing,'' Bykov said, adding, ``We all are from the Soviet Union _ everyone here older than 10 is also from the Soviet Union and no intelligent people, especially those who work in science, spit at their past.'' Putin seems to understand Bykov's sentiments and, for now, seems determined to indulge them as part of the price for maintaining political comity in Russia. But for Barinov, and millions of others Russians like him, the future of Lenin and the state symbols of Russia have almost nothing to do with what is important in life. ``They can bury him or they can keep him here,'' said Barinov, ``to me, it simply doesn't matter.'' What matters, he said, is that Russia's government start functioning competently to get the economy going. So many Russians today are simply struggling to survive that the abstractions of the political debate in Moscow can seem absurd to out-of-towners like the Barinovs. Symbols would no longer be a matter of debate if economic prosperity were to return for the average Russian, Barinov said. ``If life was good, people would stand for Tra-la-la as an anthem,'' he said.

The walls of his house across town were cracked and part of the roof had fallen, but when a neighbor told him about the plight of Las Colinas, Angel's father made a quick decision. ``My dad said, 'Let's go help them, because we need to thank God that we're alive,'' he said. ``We walked across town and we've been here since.'' Soon, the entire plain was a rescue zone, with groups of diggers swarming between the rapidly growing piles of dirt. Above the buzz of generators came shouts of ``stretcher!'' when a corpse was found. But even with the hundreds of rescuers pouring over the area, there weren't enough. Relatives stood vigil above what had been the houses of their loved ones, waiting for someone to come help them. Kathia Machaca, 27, collapsed onto a muddy mattress after waiting for more than 17 hours for crews to reach the house of her parents and her daughters, ages 5 and 8. Her husband, an electrician in Los Angeles, called her on her cellular phone, weeping and pleading for something encouraging about their daughters. She couldn't help him. ``I had hope when I got here, but that's gone now,'' she said. ``All that's left now is desperation.''

Monica Seles became the first player to reach the second round at the Australian Open, winning in just five minutes Monday when Brie Rippner retired after spraining her left ankle. Seles, seeded fourth, led 1-0, 0-15 when Rippner stumbled along the baseline and tumbled to the court. After receiving treatment from a trainer, Rippner decided she couldn't continue. It was a strange finish for the first match at Vodafone Arena, the new 10,000-seat stadium that gives Melbourne Park a second court with a retractable roof. Seles said footing on the new court was tricky but will likely improve as the tournament progresses. ``The court hasn't been played much on,'' she said. ``It's definitely a lot stickier than the outside courts I've been practicing on. Right now it's just like a glue.'' Seles said she felt badly for Rippner, her good friend and a fellow American. But because Seles is battling a virus and taking antibiotics, she was glad to play just 12 points. ``Now I can rest a couple more days,'' she said. ``I've got a low-grade fever, and I'm just really weak.'' No. 8-seeded Anna Kournikova also won her opening match, beating Daniela Hantuchova of Slovakia 6-2, 7-5. No. 14 Sandrine Testud eliminated Maria Antonio Sanchez Lorenzo 6-1, 6-0. U.S. Open champion Marat Safin, showing no signs of the sore elbow that bothered him in a match last week, beat Galo Blanco 6-4, 1-6, 6-4, 7-6 (5). Safin's serve improved as the match progressed, and he fired aces at up to 131 mph. ``The elbow for the moment is OK,'' Safin said. ``Hopefully I will serve like this the whole two weeks.'' Safin is seeded second. The victory was an improvement on last year's showing, when he lost in the opening round to Grant Stafford and was fined $2,000 for tanking. The U.S. Open and Australian Open men's titles have been won back to back four times in the past eight years, with Pete Sampras and Andre Agassi each achieving the feat twice. Safin said he's optimistic about his chances. ``I have enough game. I have enough power. I have everything to win Grand Slam tournaments,'' he said. No. 8-seeded Tim Henman and No. 9 Juan Carlos Ferrero also advanced. Henman beat Hicham Arazi 7-6 (5), 6-4, 6-4, and Ferrero swept Alun Jones 6-3, 7-6 (3), 6-2. Seles, a four-time Australian Open champion, won her first 33 matches in the tournament before losing to Martina Hingis in the semifinals two years ago. ``I've always liked playing here and always look forward to coming back,'' Seles said. She has a favorable draw this year, with Hingis, Venus Williams and Serena Williams all in the other half. Hingis is seeded No. 1 and bidding for her fourth Australian Open title, and Venus Williams is seeded third and trying for her third consecutive Grand Slam title. Defending champion Lindsay Davenport is seeded second.

Strong aftershocks Sunday sent rescuers fleeing from the search for survivors of an earthquake believed to have killed more than 300 people. But they quickly resumed the desperate hunt for hundreds of missing, using sniffer dogs, shovels and their bare hands. Workers rescued a 22-year-old man trapped for 30 hours under slabs of concrete, reviving dwindling hopes that more survivors might still be found in a quake-triggered landslide in the Las Colinas neighborhood near the capital. Drawn by tapping on concrete slabs, workers dug for hours until they reached Sergio Moreno late Sunday. Red Cross volunteer Lucio Castellano said he suffered dehydration and a cut leg, but was in good condition. Moreno was one of only a handful of survivors from the landslide that engulfed hundreds. As the death toll rose from Saturday's magnitude 7.6 quake, President Francisco Flores said he had asked Colombia for 3,000 coffins and overwhelmed officials began to bury some victims in common graves. The strongest of more than 660 aftershocks led rescuers to scale back digging in the Las Colinas neighborhood that was buried by dirt that came crashing down from a mountainside on Saturday morning. ``We still don't know anything,'' said Gladis de Carman, searching for her missing daughter and crying as she spoke on a cell phone to her mother. ``And now the ground is shaking again under us.'' The largest aftershock , measured at magnitude 5.4, caused more of the hillside to collapse late Sunday afternoon, sending rescuers fleeing in panic. None was injured, and they soon returned to the gruesome work. Body-hunting dogs, sent in from the United States and Mexico, sniffed for the living and the dead under the blinding sun at Las Colinas. ``We're looking for our friends here. This can't wait,'' said a frustrated Juan Jose Lopez, who had come with six friends to try to dig out an elderly couple and was frustrated by the delays. Saturday's quake off of El Salvador's coast was felt from northern Panama to central Mexico _ a distance of more than 1,100 miles. Sunday's aftershocks were centered within a few miles of the capital, according to local seismologists. Workers at a temporary morgue near the disaster scene said 182 bodies had been pulled from Las Colinas on Sunday. Dr. Mario Afredo Hernandez of the coroner's office, the Institute of Legal Medicine, said about half had not yet been identified, and those were being buried in common graves because there was no place to keep them. Flores told a news conference he had asked Colombia for 3,000 coffins, but said it was ``premature'' to evaluate the damage. In the post-quake chaos, rescuing took precedence over accurate counting. National Police counted 234 dead nationally, 2,000 injured, 4,692 houses destroyed and 16,148 damaged. But with bodies emerging hourly from Las Colinas alone, the death toll seemed certain to rise above 300. Eighty-seven churches were damaged as well _ including the ruined Our Lady of Guadalupe Church overlooking Las Colinas. ``We will need to do some crying today, and there will be time for that. But we all need to understand how lucky we have been,'' the Rev. Peter Danaher of Lindenhurt, N.Y., told somber, red-eyed parishioners worshipping before the rubble of brick and stone that had been their church. The only surviving wall behind Danaher displayed a cross in a stained-glass window and an icon of the Virgin. The sound of hymns drifted a few hundred yards down the ravine to rescuers digging in Las Colinas. ``I am not worried about rebuilding the church. That can be done in five months or five years, it doesn't matter,'' Danaher said. ``That is a question of brick and concrete. Ours is a question of lives and human spirit.'' Few survivors had been recovered from Las Colinas, but hundreds of people worked without sleep to hunt for more, many using only shovels, even bare hands. ``It is very dangerous here, but we are going to keep hunting. We are going to take them out alive or dead,'' said Juan Sanchez, a Green Cross rescue worker. Fearful of the aftershocks that reached magnitude 4.6, many residents of San Salvador slept in the streets or cars overnight, tablecloths or curtains covering windows for privacy. The nation's main airport reopened Sunday afternoon after being closed more more than a day. That eased the way for more relief. Pope John Paul II urged international assistance for the nation of 6 million. Mexico was first to send substantial help: five planeloads of food, medicine and 150 specialists. The United States followed with rescue crews and supplies. Offers of assistance came from Germany, Spain, Taiwan, Britain, Panama, even Guatemala, which itself suffered six deaths in the quake. Guatemala was supplying 40 percent of the electricity used by El Salvador's quake-crippled power grid, up from less than 10 percent. Police said seven people died in San Miguel, 70 miles southeast of the capital, five of them when a hillside collapsed on coffee-pickers. A prematurely born infant died when the loss of power cut hospital respirators. On Sunday, scores of patients dozed on gurneys and mattresses beneath tarps and palm trees before the quake-damaged hospital. Mayor Jose Perez said 95 percent of the houses were badly damaged in Comasagua, 17 miles west of the capital, and he said four people died. The Red Cross said 13 people died in Sosonati west of the capital and 10 were killed when a landslide buried a bus on a highway east of San Salvador.

Authorities buried many of the 400 victims of El Salvador's earthquake in mass graves, saying a landslide that wiped out entire families had made it impossible to fully know the identities of the dead. Distraught relatives lined up on Sunday at an improvised morgue in a bloodstained alley to identify some of those mangled and entombed in Saturday's 7.6-magnitude quake. But the need to dispose of the mounting number of corpses cheated some of the chance for closure. One woman looking for a pair of missing cousins showed up at the morgue in the half-buried Las Colinas neighborhood only to find out that two children who matched their description had already been sent to a mass burial. ``My cousins are similar to the ages of the ones you buried, and they are missing,'' 18-year-old Kenya Marbella told stern-faced soldiers who said it was too late to see the bodies. ``How could you just throw bodies in the ground like that?'' With no refrigerated facilities, and bodies and body parts piling up in the alley near the quake-triggered landslide that covered Las Colinas in a wall of dirt, there was little choice but mass burial, said coroner Mario Alfredo Hernandez. About half of the corpses were unidentified, he said. With aftershocks as strong as 5.4 magnitude rattling the unstable mass of soil and rubble, there was no safe place to keep the 182 bodies found in the area so far. Some corpses lay peacefully on the pavement as if the victims had lain down for a nap. Some were covered in trash bags. President Francisco Flores asked Colombia to send 300 coffins. Red Cross official Mildred Sandoval said 403 deaths had been confirmed nationwide. Police also reported 2,000 injured, 4,692 houses destroyed and 16,148 damaged. Authorities said about 1,000 people were still missing, most in Las Colinas, located six miles east of San Salvador. Saturday's quake off of El Salvador's coast was felt from northern Panama to central Mexico _ a distance of more than 1,100 miles. Sunday's aftershocks were centered within a few miles of the capital, according to local seismologists. Pope John Paul II urged international assistance for the nation of 6 million. Offers of help came from Mexico, the United States, Germany, Spain, Taiwan, Britain, Panama, even Guatemala, which itself suffered six deaths in the quake. Unlike the night before in El Salvador, when hundreds of survivors steered diggers to areas where their family members might be buried, starkly fewer people waited for relatives and friends to emerge from the immense landslide Sunday. ``Most of those that are under there now were with their families when they died,'' said police officer Rafael Hernandez. ``With everyone already dead, there is no one here to claim many of the bodies we find now.'' But as some gave up hope, incredibly, a survivor was brought up from beneath tons of soil late Sunday. Workers rescued 22-year-old Sergio Moreno, who was trapped for 30 hours under slabs of concrete. He had drawn rescuers' attention by tapping on the concrete. Red Cross volunteer Lucio Castellano said he suffered dehydration and a cut leg but was in good condition otherwise. During Sunday afternoon, a powerful aftershock caused more of the hillside to collapse, sending rescuers fleeing in panic. Nobody was injured. Body-hunting dogs, sent in from the United States and Mexico, sniffed for the living and the dead under the blinding sun. One led authorities to the battered body of a Las Colinas man who was wearing nothing but a navy blue bathing suit when the earthquake killed him. His body went unclaimed. Meanwhile, those who could identify their dead held hundreds of funerals Sunday. Junior church officials in T-shirts helped lead graveside services, while bone-weary priests in sweat-soaked suits tried to come up with new ways to reassure a devastated nation. ``Oh, mama, tell me how this could happen, tell me what else I could have done,'' stammered Jose Cruz Torres, who buried three sisters and three grandchildren lost to the quake Sunday. He began to sing a hymn in Spanish, but the lyrics were soon drowned out by his sobs. ``It's like the world here is upside down.''

Defending champion Lindsay Davenport survived a tough first-round match against Jelena Dokic and won 4-6, 6-4, 6-3 in the Australian Open on Monday. Davenport pounded five aces and a service winner in her last two service games to take command. ``Win it for Australia, Lindsay,'' one spectator shouted to the American in the last game. The 17-year-old Dokic, born in Yugoslavia but an Australian resident the last six years, has accused Australian tennis officials and the media of treating her family badly. On the eve of the Open, she demanded to be listed in the lineup as Yugoslavian, rather than Australian. Her father, Damir, said before the match that despite the outcome, Dokic would quit the tournament immediately following the match and leave the country. He contended that the draw pitting Dokic against the defending champion in the first round was rigged against his daughter. However, Dokic remained focused on the court and kept Davenport on the run with hard, deep shots and gained a key service break in the 10th game by forcing errors. In the second set, Davenport broke in the third game and then put the set away with two aces. More heavy serving put her ahead 5-3 in the final set. Dokic badly missed with a drop shot attempt at deuce in the last game, and then netted two shots. U.S. Open champion Marit Safin also struggled in his opening match. But departed from his usual style of power tennis, and it helped carry him to victory over Spain's Galo Blanco. The U.S. Open champion gained a key third-set service break with a short slice, a drop shot and a winning lob, and then set up match point with a delicate volley as he beat Blanco 6-4, 1-6, 6-4, 7-6 (5). Thanks to his lopsided second-set score, Blanco won more points than Safin, 137-133. ``He was playing unbelievable tennis,'' Safin said. ``I was very lucky. In some important moments, I played very good.'' In other first-round matches, Andre Agassi and Patrick Rafter were among the men who advanced. On the women's side, Monica Seles, Conchita Martinez, Anna Kournikova and Jennifer Capriati got to the second round. The 20-year-old Russian also showed no signs of an elbow injury that hampered his serve in a match last week. He served 11 aces at speeds up to 131 mph. ``For the moment, it is OK. I can serve and I'm really satisfied,'' said Safin, who went out in the first round at last year's Australian and was fined $2,000 for tanking. He was ranked No. 2 in the rankings at the end of the year. On his way to his second service break of the second set, Blanco sprinted back for a lob and hit a sharply angled passing shot between his legs. Safin broke in the third set's sixth game, but was immediately broken back. He was warned for a code violation when he broke his racket after netting a backhand on game point. After winning the set with his touch shots, Safin was unable to cash in two match points with Blanco serving at 4-5 in the fourth. In the tiebreaker, he reached 6-3 with a soft cross-court volley and, three points later, finished the 2-hour, 47-minute match with a forehand blast that Blanco could only push back into the net. In the last eight years, Pete Sampras and Agassi each have gone on twice from U.S. Open victories to Australian Open titles. Safin believes he can do it too. ``I have enough game, I have enough power _ I have everything to win a Grand Slam tournament,'' he said. Agassi, the defending champion, encountered few problems in his first-round match. Agassi, seeded sixth, needed just 1 hour, 40 minutes to beat Czech player Jiri Vanek 6-0, 7-5, 6-3. ``I really couldn't have done it better today, and if that continues, I have a good feeling for how quickly I'll get into my best form,'' he said. Rafter, seeded 12th, beat fellow Australian Scott Draper 6-3, 6-2, 7-5. No. 8 Tim Henman defeated Morocco's Hicham Arazi, a quarterfinalist last year, 7-6 (5), 6-4, 6-4. No. 9 Juan Carlos Ferrero beat Australian Alun Jones 6-3, 7-6 (3), 6-2, and No. 13 Cedric Pioline beat Italy's Davide Sanguinetti 7-6 (3), 6-4, 6-2. No. 14 Dominik Hrbaty, plagued by early errors, had to struggle from two sets down for a 3-6, 3-6, 6-4, 6-1, 6-1 victory in 2 1-2 hours over French qualifer Jean-Rene Lisnard. In the tournament's first match in the new Vodafone Arena, Melbourne Park's second stadium with a retractable roof, Brie Rippner stumbled and sprained her left ankle five minutes into her match with Seles. She had to retire against Seles, a four-time champion and the women's No. 4 seed, leading 1-0, 0-15. The quick result gave Seles more time to recover from a virus that has left her feeling weak. American Chanda Rubin, No. 11, was the first seeded player to lose. Slovakia's Janette Husarova beat her 6-3, 6-0. No. 5 Martinez, a semifinalist here last year and finalist at the French Open, defeated Australian Christina Wheeler 6-1, 6-1. No. 12 Capriati, also a semifinalist last year, pulled out a 4-6, 6-2, 7-5 victory over Slovakia's Henrieta Nagyova. Kournikova, No. 8, defeated Daniela Hantuchova of Slovakia 6-2, 7-5; No. 14 Sandrine Testud beat Spain's Maria Antonia Sanchez Lorenzo 6-1, 6-0; and No. 15 Kim Clijsters defeated Germany's Anca Barna 6-3, 6-2.

Taiwan's highest court ruled on Monday that the premier should have won the legislature's support before scrapping a nuclear project, a landmark legal decision that could force the Taiwanese leader to resign. Many hoped the decision by the Grand Justices would end political feuding that has already threatened to topple the minority government and has played a major role in the stock market's 44 percent drop last year. After weeks of deliberation, the 15-judge panel ruled that Premier Chang Chun-hsiung, Taiwan's No. 3 ranking leader, should have consulted with the legislature before he canceled the $5.4-billion nuclear plant, which was one-third complete. ``The legislature should make the final decision on the issue,'' Yang Ren-shou, secretary-general of the Judicial Yuan, told reporters while explaining the court's decision. The president and premier did not immediately comment. President Chen Shui-bian insisted that finishing the plant, approved in 1980, would be irresponsible because Taiwan cannot safely store the waste. The plant decision infuriated opposition parties, which control the legislature and said they must first approve termination of the project. The court said that if the premier did not want to confer with the legislature, he should resign. The premier is appointed by the president and responsible for selling the government's policies to the legislature. Shortly after the court announced its decision, the government said it would honor the ruling. ``We hope the report will allow the premier to make his report to lawmakers,'' Vice Premier Lai Ing-jaw told reporters. ``We hope that this decision will calm the people and stabilize the political situation.'' The president of the legislature, Wang Jin-pyng, told reporters that the government should immediately restore the nuclear project or request lawmakers' approval for canceling the plant. ``We should seek a resolution to help bring political stability,'' said Wang, whose once-ruling Nationalist Party won the legislature's approval of the project in 1980. Many expected that the Nationalists, who control the legislature, would demand that the premier resign and form a coalition cabinet with the powerful opposition. Scrapping the nuclear plant was a campaign promise of Chen, whose March election victory made him Taiwan's first president from an opposition party. Chen's first premier, Tang Fei, was widely criticized by the president's Democratic Progressive Party because he supported the plant. Tang resigned four months after taking office, and many blamed his demise on the nuclear issue. The opposition, led by the Nationalists, launched a campaign to recall the president, but backed away after polls showed the public did not support the move, which would likely threaten the sputtering economy.

Peru's jailed former armed forces commander has confirmed that fugitive ex-spy chief Vladimiro Montesinos tried to persuade top military commanders last September to overthrow then-President Alberto Fujimori and install Peru's finance minister in his place. Retired Gen. Jose Villanueva Ruesta said in a television interview Sunday night that Montesinos proposed the coup plot after Fujimori's Sept. 16 announcement that he was dissolving the spy chief's intelligence agency and stepping down after special elections. The proposal, which Villanueva said he and other military commanders turned down, came days after the release of a video of Montesinos apparently bribing an opposition congressman. Fujimori was later declared morally unfit for office by Congress after he fled to his ancestral homeland of Japan in November, amid mounting corruption scandals surrounding his former intelligence adviser. He was replaced by interim President Valentin Paniagua, whose mandate is to hold elections in April and turn power over to a new government in July. Former Finance Minister Carlos Bolona, now a presidential candidate, confirmed Sunday night that Montesinos had approached him with the offer to head a ``provisional government of national reconciliation.'' He said he refused the offer. Villanueva, who has denied any illicit involvement with Montesinos, was arrested near the border with Ecuador last month and placed under house arrest to prevent him from leaving the country. He was transferred to a prison this weekend on charges that he helped hide Montesinos, who reportedly slipped out of Peru on Oct. 29 on a yacht and whose location remains a mystery. Fujimori used the threat of a coup to rally support from the United States and other governments in the region to pressure Panama into giving Montesinos refuge in late September. But the spymaster returned to Peru a month later after it became clear that his bid for political asylum was going to be turned down. He immediately went into hiding, amid mounting charges ranging from money laundering and influence peddling to illegal arms dealing. Since then, dozens of former military officers, government officials and businessmen have come under investigation for taking part in Montesinos' reputed web of corruption.

McALESTER, Okla. (AP) _ Two inmates with a history of escapes, including a man who raped and murdered an 81-year-old neighbor, fled from the state prison early Monday. The inmates were discovered missing from their cells in a maximum security wing of the Oklahoma State Penitentiary about 5 a.m., said Jerry Massie, a spokesman for the state Department of Corrections. Massie identified the escaped convicts as James Robert Thomas, 25, and Willie Lee Hoffman, 21. Both were considered dangerous but there was no evidence they were armed, Massie said. They were suspected of stealing a car in the McAlester area late in the morning, said Sterling Taylor, a dispatcher for the Pittsburg County Sheriff's Office. ``They are on the road. And we don't know which way they are headed,'' Taylor said. Thomas was convicted of the 1993 rape and murder of Jessie M. Roberts, an 81-year-old neighbor who had hired him to mow her lawn. Thomas, who was 17 at the time of the slaying, was sentenced to life without chance of parole for murder plus 400 years for rape, Massie said. Hoffman is serving a 20-year sentence for kidnapping and other charges. It is the first escape from the high-security area of the prison known as H Unit, which was opened in September 1991, Massie said. A preliminary investigation indicated that the inmates removed toilets from the back of their cells, which gave them access to a maintenance crawl space, prison spokeswoman Lee Mann said. They crawled through an air duct, made their way to the roof and finally reached the ground and climbed over two fences, she said. A third inmate attempted to escape but was caught between the two fences, Mann said. Authorities said Thomas escaped from the Oklahoma County Jail in 1994. Hoffman broke out of the Payne County Jail in 1998 and from a private prison in Cushing in 1997. Authorities in neighboring Texas are searching for seven convicts who escaped Dec. 13 from the maximum-security Connally Unit, 60 miles southeast of San Antonio. They have since been charged with the Christmas Eve slaying of a Dallas-area police officer.

Two senior executives are under arrest and scores more are being questioned in a corruption probe at China's electric utility monopoly that has shaken the powerful company and tainted the nation's No. 2 communist leader. Investigators have taken over offices inside the State Power Corp., a symbol of government economic might, and ordered corporate officials in for questioning, said executives in the power industry and the company. One of those arrested was caught just before fleeing the country, they said. In a China now beset by multiplying corruption scandals, the affair stands out on two counts: Unlike many government-owned enterprises, the State Power Corp. makes money; and it is also a core of support for Li Peng, second in the Communist Party hierarchy. Two of his three children are employed by corporation subsidiaries and have working ties to those arrested. Premier Zhu Rongji, a straight-talking reformer often at odds with the conservative Li, spoke combatively about the investigation at a leadership meeting last month, prompting President Jiang Zemin, the party chief, to intervene, a former government official with ties to top leaders said, speaking on condition of anonymity. This month, the release overseas of documents exposing party debates over quashing the Tiananmen Square democracy protests further tarnished Li, who is already disliked for supporting the crackdown. Internet accounts have seeped into China, and party functionaries have chatted at work about the documents' grim portrayal of Li. Adding to the controversy, victims of a $64 million pyramid scheme protested outside the Beijing government offices in November demanding Li meet them. They claimed Li's second son, his only child not involved with State Power, had ties to the scam's arrested chairman _ a charge confirmed by a party official involved in security work who asked not to be named. President Jiang and his colleagues have promised to give China clean government and spare no offender. Yet prosecutions are so seemingly spotty they are seen as camouflage for other battles. ``Almost every official is corrupt to a degree. So who gets overthrown is very selective,'' said Wu Guoguang, a former government official and now a China politics expert at Chinese University of Hong Kong. ``The criterion is not who's corrupt. There's another criterion.'' Government media have made only glancing references to the State Power investigation and no one has suggested that Li or his children have been implicated. But word of it has circulated among Beijing's political classes. They speculate that the bad news surrounding the 72-year-old Li is being used to make sure he steps down when party posts are reapportioned late next year. But more than political power is at stake. For more than two years, State Power has resisted attempts by Zhu and his allies to bring more competition to the industry and lower electricity costs that are often higher than rates paid by U.S. consumers. Created from the old Ministry of Electric Power, the State Power Corp. has thrived in the transition from central planning to free markets. It has subsidiaries listed on New York exchanges and controls an impressive share of China's electricity, from power plants to grids to sales networks. Its holdings account for one-sixth of all state industrial assets and last year's profits were $1.1 billion. ``The Power Corp. is going to be a big player for a long time in the distribution and transmission of electricity, even though they're going to try to clip its wings,'' said Nick Driver of the Beijing consultancy Clear Thinking. ``It does help Zhu Rongji make his reforms if he's got his nemesis and all of those henchmen on the ropes.'' While investigators camped out at State Power, Zhu set up an interagency panel in November to map a strategy to reduce State Power's influence and separate power producers from distributors. A spokesman for State Power, Wen Xuting, conceded the reforms were coming but denied State Power was a target. He noted that the changes would be long-term and industrywide. However, he said he knew nothing about the corruption probe. Company insiders tell a different story. Senior managers told employees that Tan Aixing, the company's retired head of international cooperation and a consultant, was detained July 26, two executives said, asking not to be named for fear of losing their jobs. Not disclosed but widely known inside the company was the fate of Zha Keming, a vice general manager. Zha is under a form of house arrest, keeping him on call 24 hours a day for questioning, the executives said. Tan and Zha are suspected of taking money to influence power plant bids, the executives said. Foreign industry executives who knew Tan said he supposedly had stashed away a large sum of money and was about to leave China when arrested. Both men have long-standing ties to Li Peng's family. Tan at one point supervised Li's daughter, Xiaolin. Zha is vice chairman of the China Huaneng Group Corp., a State Power Corp. subsidiary run by Li's son, Xiaopeng. One of the projects purportedly under scrutiny is a $290 million plant in eastern Rizhao city, Shandong province. Zha also headed the Shandong power company, and Li's daughter's company, China Power Investment Corp., is a shareholder in the project.

Thank you Tony and good day. The official death toll in El Salvador from Saturday's earthquake has reached 600 and is likely to go higher as rescuers give up hope of finding survivors. One man was found alive Monday after calling for help on his cellular telephone but officials believe thousands of others are buried under tons of rocks and mud. Authorities are burying bodies in mass graves to prevent a possible spread of disease. Salvadoran President Francisco Florez is appealing for more international aid. VOA's Greg Flakus picks up the story. There has already been a significant response from the United States, Mexico, Israel and European nations to El Salvador's tragedy. Many relief flights are coming into a military airport near the capital of San Salvador. Here in Mexico City El Salvador's ambassador to Mexico, Eduardo Calix appeared on the Televisa television network appealing for aid. He says many of his nation's hospitals have been heavily damaged so the victims are being treated in the gardens and outer areas near the hospitals. He says medicine is being used up rapidly and that antibiotics, analgesics and anti-diarrhea are mostly needed. Greg Flakus, VOA News, Mexico City. Saturday's earthquake measured 7.6 on the Richter scale and was felt as far South as Panama and as far North as Mexico City. It also killed six people in Guatemala and damaged buildings in Honduras.

With the ground settling and time passing, rescuers said Monday that the chance of finding survivors from an earthquake that killed more than 400 people is slipping _ though one man was freed after using his cell phone to call for help. As many as 1,000 people remained buried beneath a mountain of rock and earth in the Las Colinas area here, some three miles west of the capital. Residents complained that the government allowed wealthy people to clear trees from the hillside, despite objections it could leave those below vulnerable to landslides. Saturday's magnitude-7.6 quake loosened that hillside, burying the middle-class neighborhood at its base and bringing down some of the mansions above. Although the largest number of deaths appeared to be in the Las Colinas neighborhood, the quake caused landslides across El Salvador, burying coffee workers and blocking roads. At least 403 people were confirmed dead, although that figure was expected to rise. President Francisco Flores has sought 3,000 donated coffins from abroad. Six others were killed in neighboring Guatemala, and three more were feared dead. With nearly 5,000 houses destroyed and tens of thousands more damaged in El Salvador, many people were living with relatives or in shelters. Others who still had homes lacked basic services. Water service was cut to as many as half of the country's 6 million people, the Pan-American Health Organization said. The World Food Program began distributing food to 13,000 people and had enough to last two weeks. Officials planned to seek more donations. Aftershocks continued to rock the country on Monday, frightening residents and knocking more debris onto highways. Many towns were reachable only by helicopter, and little was known about damage or deaths in isolated communities. In Las Colinas, the city, environmentalists and residents had sued landowners and construction companies to stop the deforestation of the hillside. A judge had ruled against them, and angry residents on Monday argued that the resulting development had caused hundreds of deaths. ``What good does money do us if we are subjecting our children to something like this?'' asked Santa Tecla Mayor Oscar Ortiz. After two days of rescue efforts, officials pulled Sergio Moreno from beneath a pile of cinder blocks and earth late Sunday, raising hopes that more may be found alive. But kidney and heart failure left Moreno fighting for his life on Monday. While buried, Moreno had used his cell phone to call for help. After 31 hours waiting to be freed, he began to lose faith. At one point, anguished, he told rescuers: ``You stayed here to watch me die.'' Army Maj. Jose Miranda said there was little chance more survivors would be found, adding that the majority of those under the rubble who weren't killed instantly likely had already suffocated. ``Nonetheless, at 4 a.m. they pulled out a body that still had warm blood on it, so anything is possible,'' he said. Kathia Machaca has lost all hope that her parents and two oldest daughters will be found alive. Rescuers found the body of one of her children, 5-year-old Kathia. But she has no information on the others. Pulling a child's sock from the mud, she said: ``I'm finding everything from the house except the most important things.'' She has stayed at the spot where her parents' house used to be since the quake, and she vowed not to leave. ``I won't move from here until they find the bodies,'' she said, weeping. Her daughter, who had been riding her bicycle when the earthquake struck, was found hugging a boy. ``Maybe she was afraid,'' Machaca said. She was afraid to see her husband, an electrician in Los Angeles who was scheduled to arrive on Monday. ``I don't know what I'll tell him,'' she said. ``This is hard.'' Her brother, Oscar, 25, also lived at the house, but had been at work as a chauffeur when the quake struck. ``I ran home after the quake because I thought my mother would be worried about me, but ... '' he said, pausing with tears running down his cheeks. ``I felt like I was dying.''

Hopes dwindled Monday for finding more survivors trapped under tons of earth in a suburb here after the earthquake on Saturday set off a landslide. The death toll increased. Officials said that by their estimates more than 500 people had been killed, and some reports said the number still missing was as high as 4,000. Many of the dead were in Las Colinas, a suburban neighborhood of Santa Tecla where a housing development was obliterated by a wall of earth that came crashing down a hillside. In the small southwestern town of Comasagua, an area that has been inaccessible to rescue workers, local reports said there had been a landslide that might have buried many more victims. The government of El Salvador asked Colombia to donate 3,000 coffins to help bury the dead. There was also widespread damage, clearly visible during helicopter flights by relief workers, in several towns in Usulutan Department, southeast of the capital. With many towns still without running water, public health specialists have begun to provide assistance and post-disaster counseling. In the town of San Agustin, the red tile or zinc panel roofs of many houses have partially or completely collapsed, exposing the interiors to the elements. On every block, one or more houses have been reduced to adobe and wood, and the interior of a church has crumbled behind its facade. Throughout the streets and fields, residents sought shelter under sheets of blue plastic from relief workers propped up by poles. ``Except for this area, I think some houses have held up well,'' said Kenneth Ellis, the director of the local mission of the U.S. Agency For International Development. ``But I think that there is a strong disaster in Usulutan.'' Aftershocks continued throughout Sunday night, although they have grown shorter and weaker. At least five of the aftershocks since Saturday have had a magnitude of 5.4 or more. Rescue workers, including more specially trained units from other countries, continued to comb through the dirt and debris in Las Colinas Monday. The scene was more orderly and without as many gawkers or well-intentioned volunteers as during the first two days. Bullzdozers and backhoes pried loose clumps of earth, as rescue workers shoveled into crannies and craters in a vain search for survivors. Every so often, bodies were plucked out of the ground, placed on stretchers and taken away for identification by relatives or sent to a morgue. Concern over a series of tremors in Las Colinas led officials to evacuate the residents of several damaged houses on the edges of the huge landslide that buried about 80 percent of the neighborhood's houses. A scooped-out area on the hillside marked the place where the deadly landslide began. The police also secured a four-block zone in the area to protect household belongings, although reports of theft or looting have been virtually nonexistent. ``The most important thing right now is to save lives,'' said Interior Minister Mario Acosta Ortel. ``It is a matter of time before there is a new avalanche on the houses that have been left standing.'' Officials, who have begun to compile damage reports from about 80 percent of the country, said the temblor had left no part of the nation untouched, although loss of life was minimal compared with the number of deaths in Santa Tecla. Emergency shelters have been set up in health clinics. And bodies, some of them mangled from the effects of the quake and the bulldozers that worked to clear the area, have begun to be sent to morgues. A sprawling tent city has sprung up at El Cafetalon, a recreation field in Santa Tecla where volunteers have been sifting through piles of donated clothing and distributing food and setting up medical care. Two and three families huddle under each hastily built tent of plastic and split bamboo, some of them finding their way to the camp after having had to sleep outdoors since the quake. All day, television stations broadcast appeals for food and clothing, as well as reports from stranded residents of villages who have yet to be visited by relief workers or who are desperately trying to contact relatives. With rampant _ and unfounded _ rumors of tidal waves or worse, officials have issued appeals for calm. The United States has sent five helicopters from a U.S. military base in Honduras to assist with aerial damage assessments and recovery efforts. With emergency housing becoming a priority, U.S. relief officials met Monday morning with representatives of private aid groups to begin planning for rebuilding efforts. Local work has been hampered, rescuers and others said, by a lack of coordination among the various agencies and volunteers who showed up to help. The national emergency center got off to a slow start when it had to be relocated after its original site suffered structural and other damage. Communications have also been spotty, since cellular phone service has been intermittent in some areas. The damage from the earthquake may surpass that from Hurricane Mitch, which devastated much of Central America in 1998. It is a heavy burden on this country, which emerged from a 12-year civil war in the early 1990s. ``It's not just Mitch,'' said Rose Likins, the ambassador from the United States. ``Many Salvadorans are still recovering from the conflict. The peace accords were signed in 1992, and Salvador is a model in making that a reality. Salvadorans are very resilient. I have every confidence they will weather this as they have other crises.'' Maria Arely Abrego and her four children now wonder where they will go after their house collapsed on Saturday. They spent Sunday night outdoors, before setting up a makeshift home on a Santa Tecla soccer field. ``I really have no idea what we are going to do,'' she said. ``Maybe we can go back and rebuild the house, but I think there isn't any opportunity for us there, so maybe we should do something different.'' Nearby, her 9-year-old son, Luciano, knew one thing was already going to be different. ``There won't be any football games this Sunday,'' he said, chomping on a piece of chocolate.

As the death toll in a devastating earthquake topped 600 and continued to climb, authorities shifted their attention from searching for trapped survivors to coping with the growing number of corpses. El Salvador's president said 3,000 coffins were expected to arrive from Colombia on Tuesday, and workers continued to bury unidentified bodies in common graves at Santa Tecla's municipal cemetery. As information began to trickle in from the countryside, where hundreds of communities remain almost completely cut off from the outside world, the president said workers had recovered 609 bodies in El Salvador and were searching for hundreds more. At least six people were killed in neighboring Guatemala. President Francisco Flores said 2,412 people were injured and more than 45,000 houses were damaged or destroyed in Saturday's magnitude-7.6 quake. In a televised address to the nation Monday night, he said he expected the death toll to rise significantly and that 3,000 coffins would arrive Tuesday from Colombia, a major exporter of coffins in the region. ``We must face this phenomenon with serenity and with hope,'' he said. ``We have the capacity to face what has happened, but right now the most important thing is solidarity with the people who need it most.'' Residents of Las Colinas, a neighborhood of Santa Tecla, had pleaded with Congress and gone to the Supreme Court _ without success _ to block the construction of mansions on the hillside above them, saying the lack of ground cover left those below vulnerable to landslides. Saturday's quake loosened that hillside, sending dirt raining on the homes below and bringing down some of the mansions. Angry residents on Monday argued that the resulting development had caused hundreds of deaths. ``What good does money do us if we are subjecting our children to something like this?'' asked Santa Tecla Mayor Oscar Ortiz. As bulldozers, rescue workers and a dwindling number of locals continued to dig into the mountain of dirt that buried Santa Tecla, Raquel Barrera waited for authorities to help her pull the newly uncovered bodies of her husband and 12-year-old son from the ground Monday. ``This is a nightmare. I can't believe this is happening,'' said Barrera, whose husband was a well-known professional baseball player in El Salvador. ``I left them alive, and now look, they're underneath all this.'' Elsewhere, rescue workers from around the world used sniffer dogs to continue the search for live victims. But the settling ground below their feet made painstakingly slow digging even more difficult. Army Maj. Jose Miranda said there was little chance more survivors would be found. He said the majority of those under the rubble who weren't killed instantly likely had already suffocated. But, he said, ``they pulled out a body that still had warm blood on it, so anything is possible.'' Although the largest number of deaths appeared to be in Las Colinas, the quake caused 185 landslides across El Salvador, burying anyone who couldn't get out of the way fast enough and blocking hundreds of roads. Police said nearly 18,000 people had been evacuated from dangerous areas. Many were living with relatives or in shelters. Others who still had homes lacked basic services. Water service was cut to as many as half of the country's 6 million people, the Pan-American Health Organization said. ``We are doing all we can to strengthen the hopes of our countrymen,'' Ortiz said. ``But we are a nation of very strong people and we will need that strength now.'' Aftershocks continued to rock the country, terrifying residents and knocking more debris onto highways. Many towns were reachable only by helicopter, and little was known about damage or deaths in isolated communities. ``I am totally out on the street,'' Carmelo Lopez, whose house and four family members were buried in a landslide that wiped out a coffee plantation outside of San Salvador. ``I am alone.''

As the death toll in El Salvador's devastating earthquake topped 600 and continued to climb, authorities made a final push to find trapped survivors Tuesday and shifted their attention to coping with the growing number of corpses. El Salvador's president said 3,000 coffins were to arrive from Colombia, and workers were burying unidentified bodies in common graves at a cemetery in this devastated town. The chances of anyone else emerging from the rubble alive appeared slim. Meanwhile, finger-pointing began: In Santa Tecla, where a mountainside buried a whole neighborhood, environmental activists and authorities said deforestation _ and greed _ contributed to the disaster. Residents of the buried neighborhood, Las Colinas, had pleaded with Congress and the Supreme Court to block the construction of mansions on the hillside above them, saying the lack of ground cover left those below vulnerable to landslides. Their pleas were ignored, and construction continued. Saturday's 7.6-magnitude quake loosened that hillside, sending dirt raining on the homes below and bringing down some of the mansions. Angry residents argued Monday that the development had caused hundreds of deaths. ``What good does money do us if we are subjecting our children to something like this?'' Santa Tecla Mayor Oscar Ortiz asked. Ecologist Ricardo Navarro accused members of Congress and government officials of negligence for failing to stop the deforestation. ``Several urbanization projects were born ... and there you have the results, hundreds of deaths,'' he said. In Santa Tecla on Tuesday, rescuers cleared the area where the mountainside buried the neighborhood. In the silence, Taiwanese technicians and Spanish rescuers with sniffer dogs combed the area to make sure nobody was still alive beneath ground. They then planned to use bulldozers to remove the mud and recover the remaining bodies, believed to be in the hundreds. The only rescue was of a German Shepherd named Bobby, who appeared to be in good shape. Bobby's owner, who lost his mother and his brother, led the dog away. As information began to trickle in from the countryside, where hundreds of communities remain almost completely cut off from the outside world, President Francisco Flores said workers had recovered 609 bodies in El Salvador and were searching for hundreds more. At least six people were killed in neighboring Guatemala. Flores said 2,412 people were injured and more than 45,000 houses were damaged or destroyed in Saturday's quake. In a televised address to the nation Monday night, Flores said he expected the death toll to rise significantly. He said thousands of coffins were on their way from Colombia. A Colombian disaster official, however, said he had no knowledge of a government effort to send coffins. ``We must face this phenomenon with serenity and with hope,'' Flores said. ``We have the capacity to face what has happened, but right now the most important thing is solidarity with the people who need it most.'' In Santa Tecla on Monday, Raquel Barrera waited for authorities to help her pull the newly uncovered bodies of her husband and 12-year-old son from the ground. ``This is a nightmare. I can't believe this is happening,'' said Barrera, whose husband was a well-known professional baseball player in El Salvador. ``I left them alive, and now look, they're underneath all this.''

Gunfire broke out Tuesday afternoon around the home of embattled Congolese President Laurent Kabila, who has been fighting multiple rebel armies for more than two years, witnesses said. Presidential aide Eddy Kapend went on national television shortly after the shooting ended to appeal for calm, but he made no mention of the incident. Kapend ordered all airports and borders closed, but gave no other details. It was not immediately clear if anyone was injured or killed in the shooting, which apparently lasted for less than an hour. Following Kapend's broadcast, Kinshasa residents hurried home, and many streets were quickly deserted. But no increased military presence could be immediately seen in the streets. Kabila's hilltop residence near downtown Kinshasa is known as the Marble Palace and is usually heavily guarded by soldiers and a North Korean-made tank. Kabila has been fighting a civil war since August 1998, when rebel forces backed by Kabila's former allies, Rwanda and Uganda, turned against him. The rebels reached the outskirts of Kinshasa before being turned back by Kabila's army, which is now supported by Angola, Namibia and Zimbabwe.

Congolese President Laurent Kabila was shot during an attempted coup d'etat on Tuesday, a senior military official in neighboring Republic of Congo said. It remained unclear whether Kabila had been killed during an intense 30-minute gunbattle at his palatial residence in the capital. Intelligence officials in Rwanda, which supports rebels battling Kabila's government, said they had unconfirmed reports that Kabila was dead. But senior Congolese officials insisted Kabila was alive. ``President Kabila is alive and everything is OK,'' said Congolese Gen. Francois Olenga. He gave no further details. After the shooting, a presidential helicopter landed at Kinshasa's main hospital, a government official who witnessed the event said, and there were unconfirmed reports that the aircraft was carrying Kabila's son, Joseph Kabila, who had apparently been injured. The Republic of Congo official, who spoke on condition of anonymity from his country's capital of Brazzaville, said Kabila was shot and that it was not known who was in control of Congo's government. Shortly after the gunfire erupted, Kabila aide Eddy Kapend went on national television to appeal for calm. Kapend ordered all airports and borders closed and appealed to the armed forces and civil leaders to help maintain order. ``The Congolese people need your serenity and your discipline,'' he said. Kabila's Interior Minister Gaetan Kakudji announced an 8 p.m. to 6 a.m. curfew until further notice. ``For reasons of security in Kinshasa, President Kabila has ordered a general alert of all fighting units of the capital Kinshasa,'' Kakudji said. Amid the confusion, Kinshasa residents hurried home, and many streets were quickly deserted. Truckloads of armed soldiers patrolled the streets in the capital city of the vast Central African nation. Large numbers of troops in armored vehicles and on foot blocked off roads near Kabila's hilltop residence not far from downtown Kinshasa. The presidential residence, known as the Marble Palace, is usually heavily guarded by troops and a North Korean-made tank. The Congolese president has been fighting a civil war since August 1998, when rebel forces backed by Kabila's former allies, Rwanda and Uganda, turned against him. In the war's early stages, the rebels reached the outskirts of Kinshasa before being turned back by Kabila's army, which is now supported by Angola, Namibia and Zimbabwe. Kabila came to power in May 1997 following a Uganda- and Rwanda-sponsored rebellion against former dictator Mobutu Sese Seko, who ruled the nation then called Zaire. The world community initially welcomed Kabila, who many hoped would be a vast improvement over Mobutu's decades-long rule, which left his nation desperately broke and with an infrastructure that barely functioned. But Kabila quickly alienated himself, inviting close friends and relatives into the government, angering investors and obstructing a United Nations investigation of reports that his rebel army had slaughtered thousands of Hutu refugees. Kabila's government signed a peace agreement last year with the rebel movements, though fighting has continued and each side has consistently accused the other of violations.

From BBC News in London, I am Gregor Cragey for The World. El Salvador's President Francisco Flores is warning more disasters are possible after Saturday's earthquake. Flores says there could be more landslides because the quake left many hill sides unstable. Meanwhile, there is little hope of finding any more survivors. The BBC's Malcolm Bravent reports. It has been three days since the last survivor was dug out of the mud and hope is fading that any more will be found. Officially the government's main priority is saving life, but disaster experts suspect it won't be long before the search for survivors is called off. Some analysts believe that the impact of this earthquake on Central America could outweigh that of Hurricane Mitch, which devastated the region two years ago. Twenty thousand people have been made homeless and several towns have been completely leveled. Malcolm Brevant.

This is The World. I am Lisa Mullins. El Salvador is still a long way from recovery today. President Francisco Flores warned that the tragedy that started Saturday with a massive earthquake is still unfolding. So far about 600 bodies have been recovered, but hundreds more are missing and the tremor has left many populated hillside unstable, which means residents now risk more catastrophic landslides. About 20,000 people have been evacuated so far from danger zones. But President Flores says many more people still need to be moved to safety. Joseph Schultz is with the Disaster Response Team of the US Agency for International Development. He is now in San Salvador. Mr. Schultz, can you describe the conditions there today? The search and rescue efforts are ongoing particularly in Santo Takla, which is a suburb, a small town, small community outside of the capital San Salvador. The largest area of the landslide damage is in Las Colinas. Saturday morning when the earthquake occurred the mountainside rushed down the side of the mountain and covered up to a height of about a 2-storey building, 300 to 400 homes. Have the rescue efforts waned then at all or is there still an attempt at ... In addition to the US AID Disaster Response Team we have people in from all over the world. There are search and rescue teams from Mexico, from Nicaragua, from Guatemala, a team came in from Spain, a team came in from Taiwan. It's a very international effort to help El Salvador and help respond to this disaster. The search and rescue efforts have been going on pretty much 24-hours a day since the earthquake. Teams were there first light in the morning, worked till light goes down. At night they fire generators and have floodlights on. Now I know Joseph that you woke up to an after shock early this morning. Was that followed by others and are those after shocks hampering the rescue efforts at all? Yeah, I indeed was woken up this morning about 5 o'clock by an after shock. I've heard reports that there have been anywhere from several hundreds of after shocks since Saturday's earthquake of varying degrees. Nothing which has caused severe additional damage. Nothing near the level of the original earthquake on Saturday. I think everybody expects that there will be tremors, but still I would think that they also must exaggerate the problem and induce a certain amount of panic among the survivors there. There is really not a lot of widespread panic. The Salvadorians are remarkably and I am constantly impressed by their ability to cope with this. You know, as soon as the disaster hit, people were in digging or in rescuing anyone and trying to fix their homes or fixing their roofs. You know, people do what they need to do to strive and to get on. The efforts are ongoing and will continue for several days at least. How difficult is it to get done what you need to do, be a part of the survival effort or to try and get clothing and food to some of the people around that area? The biggest challenge which we are addressing right now and I believe successfully with the landslides, a lot of the roads out of the city to out of the outlined towns and other parts of the country were cut off. So we couldn't get in to do assessments, disaster assessments. We couldn't get in to deliver supplies. We were initially doing airdrops of food and emergency supplies and now, as you know, we are a couple of days out. Roads are starting to open up, so we are able to take trucks in to the outline communities that have been affected. Things are moving. You know, we are trying to get as much aid to the right places and the right kind of relief supplies, the right kind of food to the most affected populations. What are you preparing for now coming up in the next couple of days? What do you expect to be caught on today? In the next couple of days we are intensifying our efforts of both air lifting and getting supplies out into outlying areas. The search and rescue effort in Los Calinas in South of Tekla is very comprehensive. I don't have a number of how many people are involved, but there are dozens and dozens if not hundreds of people on the ground there at any given time digging through the dirt essentially that piled up. You know, yards and yards of dirt covered the town, but apparently now as getting accurate assessments from the countryside from outside the capital up to the areas that we know were cut off by Sun, cut of by road the first two days. So our part is making sure that communities are getting the food they need, are getting the supplies they need and that people are healthy and are able to get through the next couple of weeks. Joseph Schultz with the Disaster Response Team of the US Agency for International Development in San Salvador. Thank you very much for taking the time to talk to us. Thank you.

Not many Salvadorians who were near the epicenter of the quake survived, but some did and correspondent Mike Lanchin has the story of one of them. In the Intensive Care Unit of a city hospital, a rare survivor from Saturday's giant landslide is fighting for his life. Doctors crowd around 22 year-old Serheo Morrano, just hours after he was pulled alive from the mud. Surgeon Edwardo Castill says he can't believe the young man is still alive. This is nothing short of a miracle that he survived so long. We have seen so many other people in the same conditions who haven't had the same luck. It really is a miracle he has got this far. During the 33 hours he was trapped underground, Serheo suffered severe loss of blood. His left leg is badly damaged and his pelvis is broken. According to Dr. Castill, he needs major surgery and probably will lose both legs. Serheo was found alive trapped inside his house on Saturday night by rescue workers digging at this site of the giant mudslide caused by the earthquake. He was under 10 feet of mud, pinned down by huge beams. Finding him alive was a rare breakthrough for the searchers. Jose Espehello is a Mexican rescue worker who squeezed into the ruins to help set him free. For hours on end Jose says he lay close to the trapped man encouraging him to hold on, telling him that it wouldn't be too long before he was freed. As the ground around him continued to move with the after shocks of the earthquake, Jose says that the young man begged him to speed up the rescue operation. Eventually, after more than 33 hours underground, he was pulled to the surface unconscious but alive. Jose, a veteran of natural disasters, says that witnessing Serheo's will to live during the harrowing underground ordeal has given all those involved in this rescue operation a new sense of hope. But as the hours pass in the mammoth rescue operation in El Salvador, the possibility of finding more survivors in the mud is rapidly diminishing. For The World, I am Mike Lanchin in San Salvador.

President Laurent Kabila was shot during an attempted coup on Tuesday, senior Congo officials said, and the Belgian government reported that the embattled leader was dead. Belgian Foreign Ministry spokesman Koen Vervaeke said from Brussels that ``two sources, of whom we are 100 percent certain'' said Kabila had been killed during the intense 30-minute shooting at his palatial residence in the capital. ``He has probably been shot by one of his guards,'' he said.

Bulldozers plowed through the wreckage of an earthquake-driven landslide Tuesday after sniffer dogs and heartbeat detectors failed in a final, desperate attempt to locate any more survivors in this Salvadoran town. The only one pulled alive from the rubble was a German shepherd mix named Bobby. His owner, who lost his mother and brother in the quake, led the dog away with what few belongings he could salvage before the earth movers trundled in. A man who was pulled out alive 31 hours after the earthquake and had come to symbolize hope in a nation that has little, died Tuesday night at a hospital. Doctors had amputated Sergio Moreno's legs, and his heart and kidney failed. The death toll rose to 683 and was expected to continue rising as authorities reach communities isolated by landslides. Officials said more than 2,500 people were injured by Saturday's quake, and nearly 45,000 had to be evacuated. On Tuesday, President Francisco Flores called on the more than 1 million Salvadorans living in the United States to help raise money for reconstruction. Comasagua, a city 17 miles west of the capital that was rendered inaccessible by landslides, had been reduced to a jumble of mangled houses, although only six people were reported dead there. Hungry residents swarmed around U.S. Army helicopters bringing food, water and medicine. ``All we have is God and the helicopter that brings food,'' said Fidelia Guardao. The soldiers loaded the food onto trucks, which rumbled into the destroyed downtown where makeshift kitchens awaited the corn, rice and canned fish. ``We're doing things to help people out,'' said Sgt. Bill Cagle of Carson, Calif. ``I love this stuff.'' There was little hope that anyone would be found alive in the Las Colinas neighborhood just outside the capital, where the magnitude-7.6 quake buried hundreds of houses. Still, Taiwanese rescuers combed the partially excavated area with equipment designed to detect heartbeats, and Spanish and Mexican volunteers followed dogs sniffing for signs of life buried in the mounds. After a few hours, the search ended unsuccessfully. Bulldozers and earth movers moved in to tear through the dirt and debris, searching for bodies and filling dump trucks lined up for several blocks. Nearly 350 cadavers have been pulled from the middle-class neighborhood that was buried when a nearby hillside collapsed, and officials were still finding more amid wrecked cars and dirt-packed houses. Officials had counted 677 bodies in El Salvador and at least six more in Guatemala. Many of the dead were being buried in common graves at the municipal cemetery in this devastated town just outside San Salvador. A magnitude-5.7 tremor _ the strongest aftershock since Saturday _ rocked the capital before dawn Tuesday, panicking residents still sleeping outside and sending others charging into the street. No major damage or injuries were reported. With more than 46,000 houses damaged or destroyed Saturday, Nicaragua's president visited neighboring El Salvador to appeal for international aid. ``Hopefully the aid will not only come now, but also in the reconstruction phase,'' he said. Blocked from entering the Las Colinas neighborhood where her niece's house was buried, Sonia Olivo waited outside barricades Tuesday for word on the excavation's progress. Although her niece was able to run out of the house in time to avoid being buried alive, other relatives weren't as lucky. The two daughters of another niece were found dead Sunday in a nearby house, wrapped in the arms of the woman who cared for them. ``We are just waiting to see if there is a possibility of finding anything,'' she said. With entire families lost in the landslide, many belongings lay on the muddy expanse, likely to remain unclaimed forever. Next to the remains of one house that had been partially dug out of the mud lay a photo album covered in pink taffeta, lace and dirt. Photos spilling out showed a smiling teen-age girl standing next to a cake that read: ``Happy 15th Birthday Natalia!'' Others showed her laughing with icing smeared on her face, and dancing with a man who appeared to be her father. Tucked in the back were handwritten birthday wishes. ``May God bless you and keep you always. Goodbye with lots of love,'' read one note, dated June 6, 1999. Another read: ``May you have a Happy Birthday and many more years to come.'' Scattered a few feet away were dirty pages of chemistry homework and several children's shoes. Fidel Guzman returned Tuesday to look for anything he could salvage from his parent's house, and was surprised to find that Mexican volunteers had just found their dog, Bobby. His father had been rescued earlier from the house, but the bodies of his mother and brother were found later. The dirty, black dog, a piece of rope tied around his neck, circled Guzman nervously but otherwise appeared in good shape. ``I didn't think I'd find him alive, but there he was,'' Guzman said, a long florescent lightbulb tucked under his arm.

Annoyed at her racket, Lindsay Davenport flipped it aside, slumped into her changeover chair, shook her head and muttered to herself. Davenport's body language was bad Wednesday, but her serve was good, and that saved her in the second round of the Australian Open. The defending champion withstood an upset bid from qualifier Greta Arn to win 6-2, 4-6, 6-2. Seeded No. 2, Davenport said she felt fine physically, other than being a little tired. But she played with none of the flair she showed in winning last year's title. ``I was getting sooooo frustrated and fed up with the way I was playing, and you can't do that,'' she said. ``For whatever reason, I didn't play as well as I can. Hopefully I'll get better. I don't know.'' On the tournament's third consecutive mild, sunny day, No. 4-seeded Monica Seles beat Miroslava Vavrinec 6-2, 6-3. Seles' opponent in the fourth round could be 18-year-old Belgian Justine Henin, who improved to 12-0 this year by beating Sarah Pitkowski 6-3, 6-2. Henin's winning streak has boosted her ranking from 48th to a career-high 22nd. Her next opponent will be No. 14 Sandrine Testud, who was leading 6-4, 5-2 when Jing-Qian Yi retired because of a back injury. No. 12 Jennifer Capriati, a semifinalist last year, beat Miriam Oremans 6-0, 6-2. No. 9 Juan Carlos Ferrero became the first seeded man to be eliminated when he lost to Australian Andre Ilie 3-6, 6-2, 6-1, 1-6, 6-2. Second-seeded Marat Safin, the U.S. Open champion, rallied to beat Andrei Pavel 4-6, 6-3, 6-4, 7-6 (5). Eighth-seeded Tim Henman beat Nicolas Lapentti 6-1, 7-6 (3), 7-6 (7). No. 14 Dominik Hrbaty swept Francisco Clavet 6-3, 6-4, 6-2. Davenport, who edged Jelena Dokic in a tense three-setter in the opening round, squeaked though again thanks to her serve. She lost only 10 points on her first serve, faced just one break point _ on the final point of the second set _ and closed out the win with her ninth ace. But she sheepishly admitted she gave off bad vibes. ``I was just getting a little crabby out there,'' Davenport said. ``I've allowed these girls to play well, and last year here I wasn't allowing that to happen. I'm a little bit away from my `A' game right now.'' Arn, a German ranked 146th, fared well swapping groundstrokes with Davenport and could tell her opponent was out of sorts. ``Lindsay threw her racket two times,'' Arn noted. ``It was kind of frustrating for her. ... I had nothing to lose. It was a lot of fun to play her, especially in such a big arena.'' Davenport began to move better in the final set, slamming shots into both corners to pull away. She has a favorable draw, with her top rivals _ No. 1 Martina Hingis, No. 3 Venus Williams and No. 6 Serena Williams _ in the other half. They play second-round matches Thursday. A dangerous floater in Davenport's half is Henin. The teen-ager won titles in Australia earlier this month at the Gold Coast and at Canberra, beating three seeded players in the latter event. ``When I arrived in Australia I was confident,'' said Henin, who reached the fourth round at last year's U.S. Open. ``I'm not afraid to lose now. I'm not so nervous, and I can do my best on the court.'' Henin comes to the net well for such a young player and also has the powerful groundstrokes characteristic of her generation. ``Right now she's full of confidence and all the luck is running her way,'' Pitkowski said. ``She's very solid, bangs it hard from both sides and has a backhand like the guys.'' But the young Belgian's heavy early-season schedule could soon take a toll. She played only 31 matches all of last year and is already almost halfway to that total. ``I'm confident, but I'm also a little bit tired,'' Henin said. ``I want to win all my matches, but it's difficult. Sometimes I lose a little concentration because mentally I'm a little tired.''

China's effort to join the World Trade Organization was held up Wednesday by a major disagreement over its subsidies to its 900 million farmers. ``If you want to bind our hands and not allow support for our farmers, nobody could back that,'' said China's top negotiator, Long Yongtu, after a week of negotiations ended Wednesday without sealing China's entry as anticipated. ``Our agricultural subsidies are peanuts,'' Long said at a press briefing, compared to the subsidies offered in the European Union and in the United States. When China joins the Geneva-based trade group, it wants the same flexibility that developing countries have with agricultural subsidies. Its negotiators rejected three compromise attempts this week, engineered by European negotiators, to find common ground on the issue. Although the talks appeared to be at an impasse, Long dismissed suggestions that this round's failure sinks China's chances to join the 140-country organization. ``This membership is in China's interest,'' Long said. ``China has already enormously benefited from this process,'' he said, citing a 30 percent increase in foreign investment and record exports and imports last year. China's attempt to join the organization entered its 15th year this week. Trade diplomats said the talks proved more difficult than anticipated because U.S. trade negotiators were hamstrung by the imminent change in administrations. Envoys said U.S. negotiators were not able to compromise, mindful that they could be overruled by the incoming Bush administration. Some envoys thought China was digging in its heels on agriculture and services, a wide-ranging area that covers the ability of foreign insurance and financial institutions to operate within Chinese borders, to see what more it could gain. Although no firm date was announced, talks could reconvene in late February or March.

El Salvador is facing serious health problems after Saturday's earthquake. There is particular concern about the spread of a virus that was already affecting small children before the quake. The BBC's Malcolm Bradman reports. Eighteen-month-old Juana Desvides is in agony after five days of stomach cramps. Juana is one of more than 1200 babies who've been stricken by the rotavirus in San Salvador in the past fortnight. She is attached to a drip in the Emergency ward of the city's Children's Hospital. The death toll from the earthquake continues to rise steadily, but there was one particular fatality that has saddened people still praying for a miracle. A 27-year-old man, who was the country's last known survivor to be pulled from the mud, died from complications caused by extensive crush injuries. Malcolm Bradman reporting.

Both defending champions, Americans Andre Agassi and Lindsey Davenport have advanced to the third round of the Australian Open tennis tournament in Melbourne. The sixth seeded Agassi scored a straight sets win over fellow American Paul Goldstein on Wednesday. Davenport who is seeded second in the women's draw needed three sets to beat Greta Arn of Germany. The Americans say she was not at her best. I felt just a little tired and sluggish today and I don't know if it's for finishing late the other night and maybe having a little bit of a let down after a match that had a lot of hype on Monday. But for whatever reason just didn't play as well as I can play. Elsewhere in men's play second seeded US Open winner Marat Safine of Russia defeated Andre Pable of Romania in four sets. Pete Sampras of the United States the third seed also needed four sets to overcome Bodon Oloroc of the Czech Republic but eight seeded Tim Henman of Britain defeated Ecuador's Nicholas Lipente in straight sets. Other men seeds advancing were Australian Patrick Rafter, Cedric Pioline of France and Slovakian Dominic Arbady but number nine one Carlos Ferraro of Spain was the first men seed to fall losing in five sets to Andrew Healy of Australia. In the women's draw fourth seeded Monica Seles of the United States beat Miroslava Varonec of Switzerland 6-2, 6-3. Seles said she needed time to get her game going. This really was kind of my first match because I was unfortunate in the first round. I might well have to be faster first game. So kind of I feel for me it's one of the first round. Just feeling okay, I mean they are still early rounds, just want to get through them and then just take it at a time. Fifth seeded Conchita Martinez of Spain was the big upset victim of the day as Emmanuel Galiardi of Switzerland beat her 5-7, 6-3, 8-6. Anna Kournikova of Russia also advanced. Other women seeds moving into the third round included American Jennifer Capriati, Sandrine Testu of France and Kim Clisters of Belgium.

Thank you, Vic. A Congolese government official has confirmed the death of President Loron Kabila. The official, who asked not to be further identified, tells VOA the death will be announced officially later today. The official says Mr. Kabila died Tuesday while being flown to Zimbabwe for urgent care. President Kabila was shot at the presidential palace in Kinshasa midday Tuesday by a member of his security team. The official says Mr. Kabila's body is being retrieved and a State burial will be held Saturday in Kinshasa. Other Congolese officials Wednesday continued to deny reports the President was dead. After a special cabinet meeting Mr. Kabila's son Joseph was named interim leader in charge of the government and the armed forces.

Residents of this central African capital returned to the streets Thursday for the first time since reports began circulating that the president was gunned down at his palace. Security forces kept a low profile. Traders arrived from nearby villages with their goods, but many city markets stayed closed as their administrators didn't turn up. Most stores were shuttered, banks were closed and the main business district nearly deserted. At the downtown Cybermatonge cafe, however, a crush of people was anxiously trying to get the latest news off the internet. ``I don't understand anything about our situation,'' said Matthieu Kassindi, a civil servant who was trying to reach his sister abroad for information. State-run radio was still broadcasting a Wednesday government statement insisting President Laurent Kabila was wounded but alive, despite reports from numerous foreign officials that he had died of his injuries in 30 minutes of intense gunfire Tuesday. Cabinet officials thrust Kabila's son into power Wednesday, naming him temporary head of government to fill the power vacuum that has threatened to throw this vast, deeply troubled nation into even more turmoil. The younger Kabila, who already headed the armed forces, has made no public statements. Tuesday's shooting and the questions about Kabila's fate have added to the disorder in Congo, a mineral-rich nation where a 2 1/2-year civil war has turned into a regional conflict involving troops from a host of African nations. The U.N. Security Council urged all sides in Congo's war to respect the cease-fire and refrain from military action. U.N. officials said the United Nations had not independently confirmed that Kabila was dead. Congo's presidential spokesman Lambert Kaboye said in a telephone interview Wednesday that Kabila had been evacuated to an undisclosed country. And Congo's ambassador in Zimbabwe, Kikaya Bin Karubi, told Zimbabwean television that Kabila was being treated there. ``He is in a very critical condition,'' he said, adding: ``He has not passed away yet.'' A lobbyist and public relations consultant who acts as Kabila's spokesman in the United States, however, said Tuesday the president had been fatally shot. Top-level Congolese officials had confirmed the death, John Aycoth said by telephone from Durham, N.C. Officials in Angola, a close ally, agreed Kabila had been killed. In Zimbabwe, another ally, top-ranking government officials said Wednesday that Kabila died en route to Zimbabwe's capital, Harare. The government was waiting for instructions on what to do with the body, the unidentified officials told Zimbabwe's state-run news agency. At the White House, national security spokesman Daniel Cruise said U.S. officials had seen ``a number of what we believe are credible reports'' that Kabila was dead. Details of Tuesday's attack at the palace were murky. A member of Kabila's security entourage said late Tuesday on condition of anonymity that a bodyguard shot the president in the back and right leg. French and Belgian foreign ministry officials quoted local sources as saying they believed Kabila died of his injuries. A number of Kabila's bodyguards were arrested, the wife of one of the bodyguards said on condition of anonymity. Belgian Foreign Affairs Minister Louis Michel said in a radio interview Wednesday morning that he had received reports that Kabila was killed after a disagreement with some of his army generals. He said it was unclear whether it was a general or a bodyguard who fired at Kabila. Belgium is Congo's former colonial ruler and retains close ties with the nation, formerly called Zaire. Belgian Prime Minister Guy Verhofstadt said the country was preparing to evacuate its nationals from Congo if necessary. Kabila's hold over the army has grown increasingly tenuous in recent months, with some troops reportedly threatening to revolt over pay demands. Young recruits make as little as 1,450 Congolese francs _ less than $10 _ per month. Kabila has been fighting a civil war since August 1998, when rebel forces backed by his former allies, Rwanda and Uganda, turned against him. In the war's early stages, the rebels reached the outskirts of Kinshasa before being turned back by Kabila's army, which is now supported by Angola, Namibia and Zimbabwe. A rebel spokesman said the attack on Kabila caught rebel forces by surprise. ``We didn't plan this. But we will not be ready to cooperate with whoever replaces Kabila unless the government is ready to end the war and talk to us,'' Maj. Siatilo Ngizo said. Kabila came to power in May 1997 following a Uganda- and Rwanda-sponsored rebellion against the late dictator Mobutu Sese Seko. The world community initially welcomed him, and many hoped he would be an improvement over Mobutu's decades-long rule, which left the nation in ruins. But Kabila quickly alienated himself: He invited close friends and relatives into government, angered investors and obstructed a U.N. inquiry into reports that his fighters slaughtered thousands of Hutu refugees from neighboring Rwanda.

North Korean leader Kim Jong Il, on a history-making tour to study China's economic reforms, has visited a joint-venture General Motors Corp. car factory and the Shanghai Stock Exchange. Kim's visit to Shanghai GM is the first direct contact with American capitalism for the North Korean leader, whose intensely secretive Stalinist regime is formally at war with the United States. Accompanied by Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji and an entourage of 80, Kim spent 30 minutes Wednesday at the factory, part of a $1.5 billion venture 50 percent-owned by GM. They toured the assembly line that makes a luxury Buick sedan and a compact car for the Chinese market. His surprising appearance at the GM plant was followed Thursday morning by a visit to the city's stock exchange _ a symbol of China's abandonment of radical communist economics in favor of capitalist tools. Kim, escorted by senior managers of the 10-year-old exchange, went to the observation deck overlooking the trading floor, said two exchange employees, who asked not to be identified. Traders said they glimpsed Kim at the deck's window, but didn't realize who he was until later. Kim's trip has been shrouded in a bizarre secrecy. The Chinese government has publicly refused to confirm the visit, despite Kim sightings in Shanghai. Diplomats spotted Kim in a Shanghai hotel, and foreign reporters got a glimpse of him Wednesday night outside the city's Grand Theatre after a private gala concert. The trip is only the second known foreign foray in 18 years for Kim, who arrived late Monday. His earlier trip, also to China, was last May. South Korean commentators say Kim is studying Chinese reforms to revive North Korea from an economic collapse. His visit to Shanghai GM could be aimed at learning how to handle ventures with countries that his government until recently shunned. The stock exchange offers lessons in raising money to finance reforms. South Korean President Kim Dae-jung said Wednesday that the trip was a positive sign for better relations between the rival Koreas. He said the rival North appeared to be ``trying to become a second China.'' The China visit coincides with efforts by North Korea to ease out of its international isolation. Pyongyang opened diplomatic ties Monday with the Netherlands and reached an agreement on relations with Turkey. Kim Jong Il met in October with Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, the highest-ranking U.S. official to visit North Korea. But relations with the United States are on hold while President-elect Bush, who takes office Saturday, prepares his administration.

Nervous residents returned to the streets Thursday as conflicting reports circulated on President Laurent Kabila's fate, two days after a palace shooting. Two Congolese officials said the government was preparing a radio announcement confirming Kabila's death. State-run radio said only that an important announcement would be broadcast at 8 p.m. (2 p.m. EST). But state media head Lambert Kaboyi said the government was preparing to confirm President Laurent Kabila had been killed. A lobbyist and public relations consultant who acts as Kabila's spokesman in the United States also confirmed the government would soon announce Kabila's death. The government delayed the announcement since Tuesday's attack to prevent chaos and ``save lives,'' John Aycoth said by telephone from Durham, N.C. Until Thursday, government officials had insisted Kabila was wounded but alive and receiving treatment in another country, despite reports from numerous foreign officials that he had died of his injuries in 30 minutes of intense gunfire Tuesday. Cabinet officials named Kabila's son, Joseph, temporary head of government to fill the power vacuum that has threatened to throw this vast, wartorn nation into even more turmoil. But the younger Kabila, who already headed the armed forces, has made no public statements. Initial reports indicated Joseph Kabila may have been wounded in the shooting, but Western diplomats said on condition of anonymity that they had met with him Wednesday in Kinshasa, and that he showed no signs of injury. Tuesday's shooting and the questions about the elder Kabila's fate have added to the disorder in Congo, a mineral-rich nation where a 2 1/2-year civil war has turned into a regional conflict involving troops from a host of African nations. The U.N. Security Council has urged all sides in Congo's war to respect the cease-fire and refrain from military action. Kaboyi, the Congolese state media head, said Wednesday that Kabila had been evacuated to an undisclosed country. Congo's ambassador in Zimbabwe, Kikaya Bin Karubi, told Zimbabwean television that Kabila was being treated there. Top-ranking Zimbabwean officials, however, said Wednesday that Kabila had died on route to Zimbabwe's capital, Harare. The government was waiting for instructions on what to do with the body, the unidentified officials told Zimbabwe's state-run news agency. At the White House, national security spokesman Daniel Cruise said U.S. officials had seen ``a number of what we believe are credible reports'' that Kabila was dead. Residents of the capital returned to the streets Thursday for the first time since the shooting, but the city remained on edge. Traders arrived from nearby villages with their goods, but many city markets stayed closed. Stores and businesses opened late, and most parents kept their children out of school. Details of Tuesday's attack at the palace were murky. A member of Kabila's security entourage said late Tuesday on condition of anonymity that a bodyguard shot the president in the back and right leg. A number of Kabila's bodyguards were arrested, the wife of one of the bodyguards said on condition of anonymity. Belgian Foreign Affairs Minister Louis Michel said in a radio interview Wednesday morning that he had received reports that Kabila was killed after a disagreement with some of his army generals. He said it was unclear whether it was a general or a bodyguard who fired at Kabila. Belgium is Congo's former colonial ruler and retains close ties with the nation, formerly called Zaire. Belgian Prime Minister Guy Verhofstadt said the country was preparing to evacuate its nationals from Congo if necessary. He said Belgium would send two C-130 military cargo planes to nearby Libreville, Gabon. Kabila's hold over the army has grown increasingly tenuous in recent months, with some troops reportedly threatening to revolt over pay demands. Young recruits often make less than $10 a month. Kabila has been fighting a civil war since August 1998, when rebel forces backed by his former allies, Rwanda and Uganda, turned against him. In the war's early stages, the rebels reached the outskirts of Kinshasa before being turned back by Kabila's army, which is now supported by Angola, Namibia and Zimbabwe.

Overcoming hardship is part of everyday life in El Salvador, a country of 6 million people crammed into 8,000 square miles and perched atop a major fault line. Wars, earthquakes and diseases have plagued this Central American nation's resilient residents. Bishop Gregorio Rosa Chavez says Saturday's earthquake _ which killed nearly 700 people and left tens of thousands homeless _ is another hurdle for Salvadorans to clear on faith and tenacity. ``In El Salvador we grow up thinking adversity is normal,'' said Rosa Chavez, who put his own life in danger years ago in the defense of human rights during the civil war that killed 76,000 people. Juan Bautista, a painter who lost his home when part of a mountain collapsed and buried several residential blocks, echoed Rosa Chavez as he sat under a tent in a refugee camp. ``What do I have left? My family. I am going to start again. With God's help we will come out ahead.'' Salvadoran resilience is a mixture of religious faith, work ethic and pragmatism, Rosa Chavez said. The country's capital sits in what is called the Valley of the Hammocks because of the killer earthquakes that periodically rock the area. Before Saturday, the last major quake _ in 1986 _ killed more than 1,400 people. This past year has been particularly hard on El Salvador. More than 35 people have died of dengue fever, some 5,000 cases of severe childhood diarrhea were caused by rotavirus and 119 people died of what prosecutors said were drinks laced with methyl alcohol. Throughout the past century, the country was run by a small group of families that controlled the economy and made El Salvador a regional manufacturing center until the late 1970s when the war between the military and leftist guerrillas brought it to the edge of collapse. Even during the war, Salvadorans defied bullets and other threats of violence and lined up to vote in large numbers. It was a common sight to see small businesses, bombed the day before, offer their wares under canvas tents the next day. The best known popular leader was not a politician, but a Roman Catholic bishop, Monsignor Oscar Romero, whose preachings against violence and the war brought him death at the hands of an assassin as he celebrated Mass. ``That profound religious faith is the spring that raises Salvadorans. It is a faith that may be naive, but that gives them the feeling that God is with them even though they do not understand it,'' Rosa Chavez said. A peace agreement was signed in 1992 when the guerrillas gave up their guns and became political organizations. Today the former guerrillas are the single largest minority in Congress and control several large municipalities, including the capital. ``After the war there were no cases of revenge, as we saw in other countries,'' he said. ``There was certain pragmatism involved, as if they had decided there was enough killing and they should get back to work.'' Today, political power is split between the old rightist parties of the 80s and the guerrilla groups, now turned political organizations. In his Sunday homily, Rosa Chavez urged Salvadorans to forget wasteful political discussion and ``give new life to the wonderful dream we had in our hearts after 12 years of war. Rosa Chavez found an almost biblical tone to the disaster. ``The wrath of nature hit us in the face when we were entering an almost suicidal confrontation.''

Pete Sampras is working a lot harder than he wants to at the Australian Open. Much of his effort Friday went into finding his serve-and-volley game. Defending champion Andre Agassi had to scramble at the end of the first set, but advanced to the round of 16 in just 68 minutes when David Prinosil retired with heat exhaustion. Agassi was leading 7-6 (11), 5-0 after trailing 6-2 in the tiebreaker. ``I'm definitely earning my paycheck this week,'' said Sampras, who has spent nine hours in three matches compared with Agassi's four hours. His serve was broken four times in the first three sets _ bringing his total for the week to 13 _ before he beat Argentina's Juan Ignacio Chela 6-4, 4-6, 4-6, 7-5, 6-2 in 3:08. ``I can only kick myself a little bit for letting my game slip'' while leading by one set and a break at 2-0 in the second set, Sampras said. Chela broke right back when Sampras missed a volley, and again in the seventh game when the No. 3 seed netted a volley and gestured as if he would smash his racket on the court. Two superb serve returns gave Chela another break in the third set's seventh game, and Sampras found himself trailing two sets to one. ``I've been down and out in that situation. You just try to hang in there,'' said Sampras, who earlier needed four sets each to beat Karol Kucera and Bohdan Ulihrach. Sampras didn't allow another break point, and Chela slipped into errors. ``It's not very common to break him twice,'' Chela said of the second set. In the 93-degree heat, Sampras said, ``this court definitely felt like I was playing on hot coals.'' But he said he still felt fit, and ``I feel like I get my game going at the right time.'' Sampras next plays fellow American Todd Martin, runner-up to Agassi in the 1999 U.S. Open. No. 6 Agassi meets Australia's Andrew Ilie, a crowd-pleaser who also reached the fourth round here in 1999. The winners of those two matches meet in the quarterfinals. Martin won 6-4, 3-6, 6-3, 6-4 against No. 13 Cedric Pioline, the fourth men's seed to lose. Ilie, who earlier eliminated No. 9 Juan Carlos Ferrero, beat Russia's Mikhail Youzhny 7-6 (3), 6-4, 6-2. No. 2 Marat Safin, the U.S. Open champion, breezed past Czech player Michal Tabara 6-1, 6-1, 6-4, advancing to a meeting with No. 14 Dominik Hrbaty, a 6-4, 6-4, 6-2 winner over Belgian Christophe Rochus. No. 12 Patrick Rafter, a two-time U.S. Open winner, beat Switzerland's Michel Kratochvil 6-4, 6-1, 7-5. A fourth women's seed also went out when 18-year-old Justine Henin extended her winning streak to 13 matches by beating No. 14 Sandrine Testud 6-2, 6-4. Another Belgian teen-ager, 17-year-old Kim Clijsters, seeded 15th, beat Spanish qualifier Nuria Llagostera 6-0, 6-1, advancing to a fourth-round meeting with defending champion and No. 2 seed Lindsay Davenport. Davenport beat Italy's Silvia Farina Elia 6-2, 6-1. No. 8 Anna Kournikova beat doubles partner Barbara Schett 2-6, 6-4, 6-3. She next plays Barbara Rittner, a 6-1, 3-6, 6-1 winner over Ruxandra Dragomir. No. 12 Jennifer Capriati defeated Spain's Virginia Ruano Pascual 6-0, 6-2. Next up is Spain's Marta Marrero, who beat Emmanuelle Gagliardi 4-6, 6-1, 6-2. After Prinosil pulled out, Agassi said, ``It's always disappointing when a match ends that way. You don't want anybody to get themselves in any kind of physical danger.'' He saved six set points in the first-set tiebreaker before pulling away. The heat was making the ball jump off the racket, causing him problems at first, but ``my game was taking form there so it would have been nice to finish,'' he said. Agassi wasn't expecting Sampras to fade despite his long hours on court. ``I've seen him win Slams injured. So I don't buy any of it. If he's tired or not, you've got to beat him. If he's injured or not, you've got to beat him. One of the things he has proven over the last decade is that that's not easy to do,'' Agassi added. Sampras has won a record 13 titles at Grand Slam tournaments. Agassi won his first two matches here, against Jiri Vanek and Paul Goldstein, with a loss of just 13 games in six sets. About two hours after his match, Prinosil said he felt OK, but his pulse was racing during the match and the trainer advised stopping.

Sometime before dawn on Friday, a parrot trained to sound like a machine gun opened fire at a hotel here. But otherwise, this rebel-held town in eastern Congo was quiet, watching and waiting to see whether the death of President Laurent Kabila would bring peace or a worse war. ``Everything has changed, and nothing has changed,'' said one rebel official, Jean-Pierre Lola Kisanga, a doctor before he joined the Congolese Rally for Democracy, one of three groups that had been fighting Kabila. All the heads of the three rebel movements were out of Congo when Kabila was gunned down on Tuesday, apparently by one of his own bodyguards, and even on Friday they seemed at a loss how to react. For two and a half years, they had battled him, and they seemed uncertain whether Kabila's son and successor, Maj. Gen. Joseph Kabila, would be another foe. But there was no question how regular people in the streets and spare shops of Goma feel: They do not like the rebels _ never have _ and so mourned the late president in defiance of the rebels. ``We liked Kabila,'' said Emmanuel Maseka, 46, the father of nine children and a deliveryman who says his boss has been too poor to pay him for three years. ``When the rebels hear that Kabila has died, they will drink and have a big celebration. But not us. The people of Goma are hungry.'' He was sitting on his bicycle, near a huge puddle that flowed up to the small stalls _ a barber, a machinist and fruit sellers _ along one of the main streets. Some people there conceded that Kabila had his problems, that he was no democrat. But most people in Goma seemed to embrace Kabila as the lesser of two evils, and said they would support his young son, too. ``If he's like his father, he will be good,'' said Claudia Bahata, 25, who complained that she had no job. Dislike for the rebels has never burbled up into armed opposition, but rebel officials know full well they have never won over the people's hearts and minds. The reason is partly war weariness. Kabila led the first war, in 1996, starting from Goma, toppling the much-hated dictator Mobutu Sese Seko, who had ruled the nation for three decades. It is partly, too, that they say the rebellion has killed off the economy and that the rebel soldiers are abusive. But most anger seems rooted in the view that this is a foreign war: All three rebel groups are sponsored either by Rwanda or Uganda, which supported Kabila in the first rebellion but then turned on him in 1998. The Rwandans, who call the shots with the rebel group here, are particularly hated. Most people interviewed in Goma said that the rebels and the new president would not find peace _ and that the war would only intensify. U.N. officials reported on Friday that most of the country was calm. But in the northwest province of Equateur, Jean-Pierre Bemba, leader of the Movement for the Liberation of Congo, said that government warplanes bombed the movement's soldiers on Thursday night near Basankusu, some 500 miles north of Congo's capital, Kinshasa. Bemba said six bombs were dropped but no one was hurt. But he used surprisingly measured language to describe the attack. He declined to say whether this indicated that the younger Kabila was sending an early message about his intentions. ``I told my boys, `Be quiet, we don't know what they are doing,''' he said in a telephone interview on Friday. ``It may be some accident by a local commander and not from the new regime. I will try to give him a chance.'' But relief officials in the region were bracing for the worst in a country where hunger and disease are rife and danger blocks help from the outside world. In the two eastern provinces of North and South Kivu, where an ethnic war rages in parallel with the civil war, U.N. officials say about 940,000 people have been uprooted. Elvira Pruscini, head of the local office of the U.N. World Food Program, said on Friday that malnutrition rates are as high as 21 percent _and that food can only get to a small number of those who need it. ``The major occupation of these people is to survive,'' she said. ``They are on their knees. At this point peace is a luxury. If it gets worse, what will they do?'' As if things were not bad enough in Congo, yet another conflict _ largely separate from the civil war _ is worsening in the area. For more than a year in the eastern province of Ituri, perhaps several thousand people have been killed in fighting between the Hema and Lendu ethnic groups. On Friday, after three weeks of renewed clashes, bands of Lendu attacked the northeastern city of Bunia. Relief officials said 60 civilians were killed in a battle that lasted several hours. And officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity said that the Lendu warriors had attacked Ugandan soldiers near Bunia's airport. The Lendu accuse the Ugandans of siding with the Hema in land disputes. Already, about 5,000 Hema have fled across the border to Uganda, and officials worry that many thousands more may follow if the attacks continue. ``It is already out of control,'' the official said.

Defense Secretary William Cohen is closing out the USS Cole bombing investigation by declaring that no one in the military chain of command should be accused of negligence but all could be faulted for inadequate attention to terrorist threats, officials said Friday. The Navy was releasing its final investigation report on the case Friday. As previously reported, Adm. Vern Clark, the chief of naval operations, has concluded that no one aboard the Cole should be disciplined. Officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said they expected Cohen to issue a statement Friday on accountability. Cohen believes the entire military chain of command can be faulted for not paying more attention to the vulnerability of U.S. ships in areas where the terrorist threat is high. At the same time Cohen has concluded that no individuals should be punished. The Cole was bombed by suicide terrorists in a small boat while the destroyer was refueling in Aden, Yemen, on Oct. 12. The attack killed 17 sailors and nearly sunk the $1 billion ship. ``All of us in the whole chain of command have to do a better job and we had that obligation to all of the soldiers, sailors, airmen, Marines, coast guardsmen and their families, and a better job has to be done,'' Cohen said Friday on NBC's ``Today'' show. Cohen said he agrees with the findings of an independent panel he established to assess ways in which the Defense Department, in coordination with other government agencies, can provide better protection for U.S. forces in transit around the world. The panel cited, among other things, a need for better intelligence collection on terrorist threats. In his NBC interview, Cohen said the Cole bombing exposed a seam in U.S. security precautions. ``There has not been sufficient attention devoted to those ships that are in transit, about to come into a port or while they're in port,'' he said. ``You have a number of seams'' in security. ``It's our job to make sure that we appreciate the seams faster than the terrorists do. There will always be terrorists looking for weaknesses.'' Cohen wanted to close the Cole case before he left office. Friday was his final full day as defense secretary. The job of implementing the recommended improvements in security will fall to Cohen's successor, Defense Secretary-designate Donald Rumsfeld. Because the Cole's captain, Cmdr. Kirk Lippold, did not carry out all of approximately 60 planned actions to ensure the ship's protection while refueling in Aden harbor, some believed he would be punished and his career ruined. Instead, Clark supported a determination that Lippold had done what could have been reasonably expected under the circumstances and that he was not given necessary information about the terrorist threat in Aden, a major port at the southern tip of the Saudi peninsula. Clark also believes that even with security measures in place as prescribed, the attack would not have been prevented, officials said. The nature of the attack was unprecedented, although the threat was not unimaginable. The military's written guidelines on terror threats states explicitly that harbor craft of the sort that approached the Cole ``require special concern because they can serve as an ideal platform for terrorists.'' The guidelines say fire hoses should be ready for emergency use and personnel be briefed on using them for repelling boarders, small boats and ultralight aircraft. Lippold made a decision on his own not to prepare for the use of fire hoses, another senior defense official said, also speaking anonymously. Lippold apparently believed that fire hoses would not have strengthened the ship's defenses. Some crew members said after the bombing that they saw the small boat approach the Cole and assumed it was yet another harbor craft providing trash disposal and other services. No one on the Cole challenged the craft as it approached.

good evening. this would have been a big day in washington. the last night in the white house for president clinton and his family. the eve of another bush era. the first son to follow a father into the white house since the and yet this day will surely be remembered because bill clinton finally admitted that he didn't tell the truth under oath about monica lewinsky. the scandal pursues him to the end. mr. clinton and the independent counsel bob ray have finally made a deal. mr. clinton owns up and he doesn't get indicted, though there are consequences. jackie judd, who has covered the lewinsky case from the beginning has the details. peter, these matters are not concluded. with those words from the independent counsel, the president was out from under the threat of an indictment in the lewinsky scandal. mr. clinton admitted he knowingly violated a judge's order during the paula jones deposition to, among other thing99 things, testify truthfully. at any time have you and monica lewinsky ever been alone together in any room in the white house? i think i testified to that earlier. i think that it is -- i have no specific rex. as part of the deal there was no admission of perjury, but through his spokesman, the president did for first time admit that some responses were false. i tried to walk a fine line between acting lawfully and testifying falsely, but i now recognize that i did not fully accomplish this goal. clinton's longtime lawyer david kendall insisted even now mr. clinton had not crossed a line. negotiations between kendall and independent counsel robert ray heated up several weeks ago. kendall was under some pressure because ray was considering asking a grand jury for an indictment against mr. clinton after he left office. they concluded with today's artfully worded agreement. the nation's interests have been served and, therefore, i decline prosecution. mr. clinton was facing possible disbarment for his deceit in the jones' case. instead, he agreed today to have his law license suspended for five years and to pay a $25,000 fine. i trust that the decision made today meets the expectations of the american people and demonstrates sensitivity to our constitutional system of government. president clinton, who was not seen in public today gave his spokesman the final word. i hope my actions today will help bring closure an finalality to these matters. the timing of this announcement, one day before the president leaves office, was no accident. a source says that robert ray felt that because mr. clinton's conduct occurred while in office it ought to be dealt with while he was still there. thank you very much, jackie judd, who has covered this story from the very beginning. the president's exercise of power is rapidly shrinking. he has very little time left in which to make decisions which will actually count. one of the things he has been considering today are the issuance of numerous pardons. john cochran is at the white house tonight. john, it hasn't actually been made public, but who are they considering in these final hours? a cliff-hanger here. the president knows more about his own feat tonight. he's agonizing, we're told, over the fate of others, including some old close friends from arkansas. some of these people being considered for pardons are not in prison, but they still want a pardon. for example, webster hubbell, a former justice department official from arkansas convicted on several accounts, including tax evasion. he was loyal to the clintons. same with susan m dougal who served some time in jail for contempt because she refused to testify about the clintons. a former member of the president's cabinet, henry cisneros had pled guilty to lying to the fbi about the amount of money he gave to his miss stress. some under consideration for pardons have no particular connection to the clintons, like michael milken. known as the junk bond king on wall street. milken's friends were one hour ago, peter, still lobbying for a pardon for him. leonard peltier, a native american convicted of killing two fbi agents. jonathan pollard convicted of spying for israel. the israeli government has pushed hard for his release. one more name being added to the list, former new jersey senator harrison williams. thanks very much, john cochran at the white house. this is the president's last night to exercise his power of pardon. one other character whose figured very significantly in american life? linda tripp. one of the central figures in the monica lewinsky case, has lost her job at the pentagon. all political appointees, and she was one, are required to resign when a new administration begins. she said she shouldn't have to quit because she is a whistleblower and thus, protected. and she may sue.

The three main backers of slain Congolese President Loron Kabila, Angola, Namibia and Zimbabwe say they will not withdraw their troops from the Democratic Republic of Congo in the wake of the President's assassination. Meanwhile heavy fighting is reported in the eastern part of the DRC. Katy Simon reports the fighting erupted early Friday in the town of Bunea, which is near the Ugandan border and controlled by Ugandan backed rebels. The death of Loron Kabila has done nothing to stop the fighting in the Congo. At dawn heavily armed rebels belonging to the Lendu ethnic group attempted to seize Bunea airport and radio station. Ugandan forces returned fire. Bunea and the surrounding area are controlled by Jean Pierre Bamba's Congo Liberation Front or FLC, one of several Ugandan backed rebel groups that have been fighting for several years to overthrow the Kabila government. Mr. Bamba blames the latest fighting on what he calls undisciplined Lendu rebels who are trying to get into Bunea. Mr. Bamba's Congo Liberation Front, a recently formed alliance of all the Ugandan backed groups, controls most of Northern and Eastern Congo, an estimated 900,000 square kilometers of territory. Mr. Bamba says his alliance marks the beginning of a real alternative to the Congolese people. Uganda sent thousands of troops into Congo in support of Congolese rebel groups fighting to overthrow President Kabila since August 1998. Katy Simon for VOA News, East Africa bureau. The rebels are accusing government forces of dropping bombs near the North Western town of Basankusu. Meanwhile the appointment of Joseph Kabila to succeed his father has angered the rebels fighting the government, opposition leaders and some citizens. Mr. Kabila's body was on display Friday in the capital of Zimbabwe, Harare. He is to be flown to his Southern strong hold Lumbumbashi on Saturday and then on to Kinshasa Sunday for funeral services.

And right now it's time for a look at Sports. World number one women's tennis player Martina Hingis of Switzerland and Olympics men's champion Yevgeni Kafelnikov of Russia have third round matches Saturday at the Australian Open Tennis tournament in Melbourne. No results to report as yet. Now with rest of the day's Sports, here's Dave Byrd. A jury in Charlotte North Carolina has found former National Football League player Ray Karuth not guilty of the murder of his pregnant former girlfriend Jerica Adams. However, Karuth was found guilty of three other felony charges and faces as much as twenty years in jail. The jury's decision was unanimous. The panel was originally deadlocked and then was instructed to continue deliberations until a verdict was reached. Karuth showed no emotion Friday when Judge Charles Lamb read the verdict. The jury has returned. It's unanimous verdict said the defendant is guilty of discharging a firearm in occupied property, guilty of using an estimate with intent to destroy an unborn child, guilty of conspiracy to commit murder and not guilty of first degree murder. The verdict means that Karuth does not have to face the death penalty. Karuth was accused of planning the murder of Adams in November of 1999. A former wide receiver for the Carolina Panthers, Karuth did not fire the fatal shots. His co-defendant said he arranged the shooting because he did not want to pay child support.

President Joseph Estrada's hold on power fell apart as military and political allies abandoned him and hundreds of thousands of Filipinos threatened to march on the presidential palace at dawn Saturday to force him out. The former movie star, beleaguered for months by corruption allegations, was reportedly negotiating over terms for his resignation. His vice president _ who has led the opposition campaign to remove him _ on Friday declared herself the new commander in chief of the military. On the streets, where demonstrations have persisted nonstop since Tuesday's collapse of the Senate impeachment trial, more than 100,000 stayed all night _ waving flags, listening to rock 'n' roll bands and chanting. The protests, which were festive at times, united elements as diverse as big business and left-wing communist groups. Peanut vendors mingled with high school bands, students in school uniforms and comics impersonating Estrada. Many demonstrators sported banners, T-shirts or stickers reading ``Erap resign'' _ referring to the president by his nickname. Earlier this week, Estrada had appeared to be on the verge of beating charges that he received millions of dollars in kickbacks and funds skimmed from tobacco taxes. But on Friday, amid rumors of an impending coup, Estrada went on television twice: first to offer to resume the impeachment trial, then _ after the stream of defections accelerated _ to propose he step down after elections in May in which he would not be a candidate. However, Estrada's opponents wanted him out of office immediately to end a political crisis that has further damaged this Southeast Asian nation's already ailing economy. Sen. Raul Roco, speaking on behalf of the opposition, said Estrada had until 6 a.m. Saturday (5 p.m. EST Friday) to step down. If he refused, Roco said, the crowds of protesters already on the streets would march on the presidential palace. ``Our soldiers will give us support,'' Roco claimed. About 250,000 protesters were gathered all day around a monument to the 1986 ``people power'' revolution that ousted dictator Ferdinand Marcos. The crowd erupted into screams and cheers Friday when the head of the armed forces, Gen. Angelo Reyes, stepped on stage. A low-flying airplane dropped confetti and drummers beat a frenetic rhythm as Reyes, who had been an Estrada supporter, called on the president to resign. The appearance recalled the end of Marcos _ who fled the country after the people and the military turned against him _ and it fired up the crowd. ``I am overwhelmed,'' said Antoinette Cordero, a 21-year-old medical student who stood on tiptoes for a glimpse of Reyes in his crisply pressed uniform. ``I was feeling bad about the government and the future. That just changed.'' Wildly chanting demonstrators hanged Estrada in effigy and conducted a mock trial that found him guilty. National police officials _ many still in uniform _ mingled with protesters, some of whom chanted ``soldiers of the country, standing up for their rights.'' The air force chief, the defense secretary and other Cabinet ministers who abandoned Estrada also appeared. Estrada's offer to step down after elections appeared to be aimed at preventing Vice President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo from succeeding him. Macapagal-Arroyo, the daughter of a former president, rejected the offer. ``The president has not only lost moral authority to govern, but now has no government,'' she said in a statement in which she called herself the ``new commander in chief.'' Opposition leaders said they were negotiating with Estrada, who aides said was still in the palace. Four armored vehicles pulled into the palace compound Friday evening then left moments later. Officials said three airplanes were put on standby at nearby Villamor Air Base amid rumors Estrada and his family could head for the United States or Australia. Macapagal-Arroyo's chief of staff said Estrada was reportedly asking for a few days before stepping down. ``That's not acceptable,'' said chief of staff Renato Corona. He also hinted the opposition would not accept a pardon for Estrada, saying: ``If a crime has been committed he has to face the charges.'' Estrada has been battling for his political future since his longtime friend Ilocos Sur Gov. Luis Singson came forward in October and claimed he had helped the president take some $8 million in kickbacks from illegal gambling and $2.7 million skimmed from tobacco taxes. The charges eventually built into the impeachment trial at the Senate. The trial collapsed when senators serving as judges voted narrowly on Tuesday to block access to bank records prosecutors said would prove Estrada had millions of dollars hidden away. The prosecutors resigned in protest, prompting demonstrations demanding Estrada's ouster that grew larger and larger each day. In his first televised statement Friday, Estrada insisted, ``My conscience is clear,'' then said he was willing to open the bank records in a last-ditch gambit to salvage the rest of his term, due to end in 2004. Hours later, the weary-looking president went on television again, saying he would not run if Congress called a presidential election in connection with congressional balloting set for May. ``Since I still have the support of a significant segment of our people, I don't think that the present polarization can be healed by a new leader who will take over without an electoral mandate from our people,'' Estrada said. But the man popularly known as ``Erap'' who came to power in a landslide 1998 election victory had run out of allies. Even his top ally in the Senate, Francisco Tatad, said it was time for his friend to ``do the honorable thing'' and end a ``crisis of epic proportions.'' Sensing Estrada was finished, traders swung into action late Friday and pushed the battered peso sharply higher. It surged to 47 to the dollar, compared to its previous level of more than 54 to the dollar.

In a sister act on adjoining courts, Venus and Serena Williams each yielded just five games, had winning stretches of seven games, and made unwanted mistakes. Heading toward a possible semifinal meeting in the Australian Open, both advanced to the round of 16 on Saturday, spending less than an hour in temperatures magnified to 125 degrees by sun reflecting off the courts. Venus, the Wimbledon, U.S. Open and Olympic champion, beat Czech player Denisa Chladkova 6-4, 6-1, serving eight aces at speeds up to 118 mph. Serena won 6-1, 6-4 against Thailand's Tamarine Tanasugarn. Top seed Martina Hingis, who could prevent a sisters' meeting, reached the fourth round by coming back from 2-4 to beat wild card entry Virginie Razzano of France 7-5, 6-1. ``It was very hot. I didn't really want to make my stay too long,'' Venus Williams said. ``Today was pretty fortunate.'' The air temperature was 93 degrees, but thermometers at courtside soared higher. Clouds lowered the temperature to 75 for some of the later matches. After gaining an early break, Venus said, she was hurt by unforced errors. But the No. 3 seed started a seven-game winning streak at 4-4, taking her to 5-0 in the second set in the main stadium court. Serena won seven in a row after being broken in the first game. But then Tamarine broke twice and held twice for a 4-3 lead in the second set, and Serena had to break again in the ninth game with some heavy hitting to set up the victory on nearby Court 1. ``I was pretty disappointed with the way I played today,'' Serena said. ``It's not that I wouldn't move my feet _ I couldn't. It was very weird. ``The wind was chasing the ball a little, and I just didn't do the things that I want to do,'' the No. 6 seed added. The wind seemed much stronger on Serena's court, which has lower walls than the adjoining Rod Laver Arena where Venus played. In her fourth round, Serena plays the winner of a night match between Olympic silver medalist Elena Dementieva, the No. 9 seed, and Czech player Daja Bedanova. Venus meets No. 13 Amelie Mauresmo, the 1999 Australian runner-up, who beat Croatia's Iva Majoli 6-4, 6-2. No. 7 Mary Pierce, the French Open champion, became the fifth women's seed to lose, falling 6-3, 6-2 to Argentina's Paola Suarez. Suarez next plays No. 10 Amanda Coetzer, a 6-2, 6-4 winner over German Marlene Weingartner, and Hingis meets Italy's Rita Grande, who beat Australian Evie Dominikovic 6-3, 6-4. A fifth seed also lost on the men's side. No. 10 Wayne Ferreira, who said he was hampered by a finger injury from catching a ball in the warmup, lost 6-0, 3-6, 6-4, 6-3 to 19-year-old Swede Andreas Vinciguerra. Greg Rusedski, who beat top seed Gustavo Kuerten, moved on easily by ousting German qualifier Lars Burgsmuller 6-1, 6-2, 6-1 in 1 hour, 25 minutes. Next up is No. 15 Andre Clement, who beat Switzerland's Roger Federer 7-6 (5), 6-4, 6-4. Rusedski said he was pleased at coming back strongly after his five-set match with Kuerten. ``That's another positive for me, to come off the match feeling physically good and being able to serve and volley, serve a high percentage again and play the game I wanted to,'' Rusedski said. Olympic gold medalist Yevgeny Kafelnikov, the 1999 champion and 2000 runner-up here, and 2000 semifinalist Magnus Norman both struggled for 2 1/2 hours, starting in the heat and ending in cooler temperatures. No. 5 Kafelnikov rallied to beat American Chris Woodruff, a quarterfinalist last year, 6-7 (3), 7-5, 6-2, 6-3. ``Winning the second set was a huge relief,'' said Kafelnikov, who next plays Vinciguerra. ``I knew I was back in the match and my chances would come.'' Woodruff said heat wasn't the problem. ``I became a little too predictable with the way I'm playing,'' Woodruff said. ``He seemed to get a good groove.'' No. 4 Norman beat Spain's Alex Calatrava 7-6 (2), 3-6, 7-6 (2), 6-3, to advance to a meeting with No. 16 Sebastien Grosjean. Grosjean beat Sweden's Thomas Johansson 6-4, 6-1, 6-4.

The United States has issued a warning to its citizens about possible ``disorderly and violent'' demonstrations during a meeting of political, business and cultural leaders in Switzerland next week. In a public announcement issued Friday, the State Department said a number of groups had threatened to disrupt the World Economic Forum, taking place in the eastern ski resort of Davos Jan. 25-30. ``American citizens are urged to exercise caution and consider deferring travel to Davos during this period,'' the announcement said. It said the demonstrations could be similar to those during the World Trade Organization meeting in Seattle in 1999 and International Monetary Fund and World Bank meetings in Washington and Prague last year. ``There is a potential that some demonstrations may become disorderly and violent,'' the announcement added. About 3,200 people, including more than 30 heads of state and prime ministers, are expected to attend the annual event, which has been targeted in previous years by groups opposed to globalization and the WTO. Protesters clad in hoods, scarves and dark glasses held a press conference earlier this month and pledged they would reach Davos despite an official ban on demonstrations and police screening of vehicles and trains. Swiss authorities plan to deploy 600 soldiers to boost stretched police forces and keep potentially violent demonstrators at bay. Protests last year turned violent, with two policemen injured and minor vandalism. ____ On the net: U.S. government warning: http://travel.state.gov/switzerland_announce.html World Economic Forum: http://www.weforum.org Protesters' site (in French): http://www.under.ch

A presidential jet delivered the body of slain Congolese President Laurent Kabila to his home district in southeastern Congo Saturday, where he will lie in state before being flown to the capital for an official funeral, state radio reported. The white and gold casket was first taken to his home in Lubumbashi. State radio reported the open coffin would later be displayed in the June 30th Building, where his hand-picked National Assembly meets. A state funeral is planned for Tuesday in Kinshasa. Kabila's body was flown from Zimbabwe, where government officials say he was taken for medical treatment after being wounded in Kinshasa on Tuesday. Exactly when and where Kabila died remains unclear, with Congolese and Zimbabwean officials contradicting one another. As Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe looked on, a Zimbabwean military band honored the slain president Saturday as the casket was loaded onto the plane. Mugabe, one of Kabila's key military allies, declared three days of official mourning in Zimbabwe. ``This is indeed one of our saddest moments as we gather here to view the body of our comrade in arms, friend and brother revolutionary,'' Mugabe said. State television showed footage of military officers filing past Kabila's open casket with bowed heads. Mugabe said Zimbabwe will continue to support peace efforts to end the 2 1/2-year Congolese civil war, but would defend the government against Congolese rebels backed by Rwanda and Uganda, the state-controlled media reported Saturday. Zimbabwe has 11,000 troops, backed by air power and armor, fighting alongside Congolese forces. At a news conference in Kinshasa, U.N. Special Representative Kamel Morjane said all sides in the conflict had agreed to cooperate with the U.N. peacekeeping mission, known as MONUC, sent to monitor a cease-fire agreement. ``We have no apprehensions regarding our relations with the authorities,'' Morjane said. ``The new head of state confirmed not only his good will, but also his intention to have good relations with MONUC.'' On Friday, Congolese Communications Minister Dominique Sakombi announced that Kabila's son Joseph, who was named the temporary head of government after his father was shot Tuesday, ``assumes the permanent responsibilities as head of the government and the army.'' Cabinet officials thrust Kabila's son into power Wednesday to fill the power vacuum that has threatened to throw Africa's third largest nation into even more turmoil. Much is unknown about the younger Kabila _ even his age: Most reports say he is 31 or 32 years old, but some relatives say he's 29. And while media images of the young leader with officials or foreign ambassadors have been broadcast, the public has yet to hear him speak. His installation as Kabila's replacement was rejected Friday by rebel representatives and unarmed opposition groups in Belgium, Congo's former colonial ruler, who called for talks to decide Congo's political future. Uganda appealed Friday to the new leadership to give top priority to the restoration of peace. Angola and Namibia said Friday they would keep their troops in Congo for the moment. Angolan, Namibian and Zimbabwean leaders plan to meet soon to discuss their future involvement in the country, Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos said.

Like nearly everyone in the Philippines, Gloria Macapagal Arroyo slips into reverent tones when talking about Corazon Aquino, the heroine of the 1986 uprising known as people power. ``She is a role model to me,'' Arroyo said in an interview in Manila last October. ``She ousted a dictator in a peaceful manner.'' Saturday, Arroyo toppled another Philippine leader, Joseph Estrada, to become the second woman to be president of this politically turbulent country. While Estrada's supposed crimes are penny ante compared with the epic larceny of Ferdinand Marcos, the uprising against Estrada has turned Arroyo into a symbol of healing, much as Aquino was. That is where the similarities end. Far from being thrust into her historic role by tragic happenstance, Arroyo planned her ascension to the presidential palace with discipline and foresight. Arroyo, 53, was one of several Cabinet officials to abandon Estrada after he became engulfed in a corruption scandal last fall. She resigned as social welfare secretary but remained vice president, which kept her in line for the presidency. While not openly calling for his resignation, she quickly unified the opposition to Estrada around herself. ``My role is to be leader of the united opposition,'' she said at the time. ``It is a more modest role. We don't want a revolution.'' Arroyo assembled a shadow government during the three months of political upheaval. When the military withdrew its support of Estrada on Friday, it seemed not only proper, but inevitable, that the defense secretary and armed forces chief would stand behind the 5-foot-1-inch vice president. Certainly, she will be a stark contrast to Estrada, the hard-living former movie actor who reveled in his popularity among the poor. An economist trained at Georgetown University, Arroyo is the daughter of Diosdado Macapagal, who was the president of the Philippines from 1961 to 1965. At Georgetown, she became friends with a classmate, Bill Clinton, whom she still visits on trips to Washington. Arroyo had settled into a career as an academic before she entered government in 1986 as the undersecretary of trade in the Aquino administration. She was elected to the Senate in 1992 and the vice presidency in 1998, forging an alliance with Estrada. The two made an odd pair. Estrada is shambling and plain-spoken while Arroyo is neatly groomed and tightly controlled _ a politician who never gives a two-word answer where one word will do. Like Arroyo, her husband, Mike, is the scion of one of the Philippines' elite families. The couple, who live in one of Manila's best neighborhoods, have three children. In her speech after being sworn in, Arroyo drew a contrast between herself and Estrada, saying she would promote a ``work ethic and a dignified lifestyle.'' ``The presidency is not a position to be enjoyed,'' she declared. ``It is a position where one must work hard.'' Whether diligence alone will endear Arroyo to the Philippine people is not clear. Her popularity ratings hover above 70 percent, but analysts say she lacks the affection among poor voters that until recently sustained Estrada. ``Gloria has always been popular as long as there was no competition,'' said Karina Constantino-David, a sociologist who served in the Cabinet with her. ``Whether she can convert that popularity into loyalty is another question.'' Perhaps the most immediate test for Arroyo will be the economy. Her first appointment on Saturday was of a new finance secretary, Alberto Romulo, who served as budget secretary under President Aquino. She said her top priority would be to eradicate poverty in the Philippines. Analysts said Arroyo was also determined to win back the confidence of foreign investors, which had been badly shaken by the metastasizing corruption scandal. As a senator, Arroyo helped draft the legislation that enabled the Philippines to join the World Trade Organization. Still, at the Edsa Shrine in Manila where thousands gathered to protest last week, the focus was so much on getting rid of Estrada that the demonstrators had given little thought to Arroyo. ``We're fed up with all politicians,'' said Kathy Sage, 15. ``My God, how they rip off the Philippines.'' Arroyo is not immune to some of the criticisms leveled at Estrada. Her family has had close ties with Bong Pineda, a reputed leader of illegal gambling rings. She said she has no involvement in the kind of rackets from which Estrada is accused of skimming $8 million in kickbacks. Arroyo said that any future president of the Philippines would have to combat the gambling culture that is deeply ingrained here. ``There are places in the Philippines where there is very little gambling,'' she said. ``In the end, it comes down to political will.''

Having ridden to power on a wave of popular revulsion at the corruption of her predecessor, Gloria Macapgal Arroyo began her term as the 14th president of the Philippines with a call for national healing to overcome the tumult that forced President Joseph Estrada from office Saturday and had deeply divided the country for weeks. Arroyo, a 53-year-old economist, faces considerable challenges in leading this poor but proud Southeast Asian nation of 90 million people, who have grown almost accustomed to political chaos, military coups, island insurgencies and economic instability. Foremost among those challenges are restoring credibility to the country's tainted political system and rebuilding its shattered economy, including attracting foreign investment, reducing high unemployment, and taking steps to bridge the huge gap between the rich and the poor. But perhaps the most formidable task Arroyo must face is how to deal with her predecessor, Estrada, who has vowed to remain in the country amid widespread calls for him to be brought to justice. Prosecutors had alleged that Estrada, a former movie idol who was once especially popular among poor Filipinos, had secretly amassed tens of millions of dollars in bribes since becoming president in 1998. Estrada finally agreed to relinquish power early Saturday after most of his Cabinet had resigned, top military officials had withdrawn their support and tens of thousands of protesters had massed in the streets. In a joyous celebration of their victory at a monument to the ``people power'' revolution that drove former dictator Ferdinand Marcos from power in 1986, the crowds waved banners reiterating their call for Estrada's resignation and wildly cheered many members of the political, religious and business elite who appeared before them. Most prominent figures in the Philippines had united in recent weeks in a quest for Estrada _ who was considered vulgar by many of the elite _ to step down. Corazon Aquino, who took over after the 1986 revolt, was there Saturday to give Arroyo her political blessing; a religious blessing for the new president came from Cardinal Jaime Sin, the nation's spiritual leader. Also on stage to accept the salutations of the crowd was former president Fidel V. Ramos, still an immensely influential figure who left office reluctantly after failing to amend the constitution and prolong his six-year tenure. In her address to the crowd and to the nation live on television and radio, Arroyo said her administration would proceed cautiously so as not to further disrupt the nation, but she vowed to clean up the government and address the needs of the people. ``In all humility, I accept the privilege and responsibility to act as president of the republic,'' she told the cheering throngs. ``I do so with a sense of trepidation and a sense of awe.'' Pressure on Estrada to resign escalated on Friday when his government virtually collapsed with the resignations of key Cabinet members and defections of senior military officials, including Defense Secretary Orlando Mercado and Chief of Staff Gen. Angelo Reyes. As tens of thousands of protesters formed a human chain across the capital, Estrada sought to soothe angry demonstrators by offering to hold elections in May, for which he said he would not run. But opposition and religious leaders rejected the offer and gave Estrada until 6 a.m. Saturday to step down or face a massive march of demonstrators on Malacanang Palace, the presidential residence. Still he refused to relinquish power, requesting a grace period of several days to plan what he termed an orderly transition and to procure a pardon against prosecution. But when the opposition vowed and the Supreme Court agreed to swear in Arroyo as president by noon Saturday, Estrada realized it was time to go. (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) Arroyo made thinly veiled attacks on Estrada in her acceptance speech, saying she would ``promote a work ethic and a dignified lifestyle'' and saying that results were more important than grandstanding. ``The presidency is not a position to be enjoyed, it is a position where one must work very hard,'' she said. ``Our politics of personality and patronage must give way to new politics.'' (END OPTIONAL TRIM) Late into the night across Manila, thousands of jubilant people, many of whom had earlier vowed to storm the presidential palace if Estrada did not step down, celebrated what they saw as a maturation of democracy in the Philippines. Like many revelers, Manny Reyes, a construction worker, expressed pride that his country's political crisis was resolved without bloodshed. ``The people spoke and their voices were heard,'' he said. ``All that's left to do now is to put Estrada in jail.'' Many Filipinos, who are still upset that former President Marcos went into exile and was never tried for his alleged abuses, insist that Estrada be held accountable for his alleged wrongdoing. ``We need some closure,'' Reyes said. As pressure mounted for Estrada to step down, the Supreme Court ruled Saturday morning that he should be stripped of the presidency and authorized the chief justice, Hilario Davide, to administer the oath to Arroyo without Estrada's resignation. About two hours after Arroyo was sworn in, Estrada and his family left the presidential palace at 2:15 p.m. Local journalists said the president looked drawn and gaunt but said he tried to smile as he waved goodbye to palace employees. He hugged some Cabinet officials who were in line to say goodbye to him. In a farewell gesture, Estrada said ``thank you'' and gave a final salute to his guards. Reporters said his son, Jose Victor, and daughter, Jackie, were crying. Estrada took a barge from the palace grounds to the Presidential Security Group complex, where cars were waiting to take him to his private residence. Once there, he stopped by a local municipal office, where crying supporters greeted and hugged him. Until late Saturday, Estrada remained at home and was reported by local media as saying he would ``live and die'' in the Philippines. However, there were reports among the diplomatic community that Estrada was preparing to flee, possibly to the United States or Malaysia. In a statement, Estrada said he had ``strong and serious doubts'' about the legality and constitutionality of Arroyo's appointment but said he would step down for the good of the country. Asked if she planned to prosecute or pardon Estrada, Arroyo was vague. ``You know we're talking about a healing, so when it happens, it will happen without much fanfare but as a matter of course.''

President Clinton's final pardon list Saturday was notable for names not included, especially that of Michael R. Milken, the convicted Wall Street financier whose appeal for clemency was a source of great debate. Clinton had, in fact, signaled his willingness to pardon Milken, even as recently as the week before last, based on his philanthropic record. But the president was apparently persuaded not to do so because of protests from law enforcement officials and several aides in the administration who counseled that a Milken pardon would not be appropriate. Milken's spokesman, Geoffrey Moore, said that upon learning he would not receive a pardon, Milken told him: ``Back in '93, I was given a year to live so in that context, it's hard to be disappointed about this.'' Moore added, ``He's an optimist and always looking to the future and continuing his work in education and medical research.'' Clinton began considering a pardon for Milken after being pressed to consider the idea by Ron Burkle, a California supermarket magnate who has been a generous donor to the Democratic Party and has pledged, fund-raisers said, to provide support for the Clinton Presidential Library in Little Rock. Ark. But after the report appeared, the White House received strong protests, principally from the U.S. attorney's office in Manhattan, which had initially prosecuted Milken, and from the Securities and Exchange Commission, which had brought an action against him after he served nearly two years in jail. Milken, who pleaded guilty to six counts of securities fraud in 1990, served nearly two years in prison, paid more than $1 billion in fines, penalties, restitution and civil settlements and was barred from the securities business for life. Mary Jo White, the U.S. attorney in Manhattan, and Richard H. Walker, the director of enforcement for the Securities and Exchange Commission, had written Clinton asking him not to issue a pardon. Those who have objected to granting Milken a pardon said they felt he was an inappropriate candidate because he had been charged with violating orders to stay out of the securities industry as part of his original plea bargain. The week before last, the New Yorker magazine published an examination of the business activities Milken undertook after leaving prison that resulted in the SEC complaint. The complaint was eventually settled with no admission of guilt, but Milken agreed to return $47 million in consulting fees that he received for bringing together various business leaders and counseling them on deals and investments.

in washington this was a day about beginnings, but it's also one of farewells. bill clinton said good-bye. few people can really know what it must be like to leave the white house as president that final time. we do know that mr. clinton worked right up until the end, granting more than 100 pardons as he walked out the door. here's abc's john cochran. wo 7777 an hour after seeing george w. bush sworn in, bill clinton for the first time in 8 years was no longer introduced as the president of the united states. it is, indeed, my great honor and privilege to introduce to you now our president of the united states. cheers this was the farewell from his washington friends. many had served in his government. many of them are not sure what the future holds for them. you know how it is when you leave the white house, you wonder if you'll draw a crowd again. the president told supporters they should be proud of what his administration had accomplished. you gave me the ride of my life. i tried to give as good as i got. even though he tried to keep up the spirits, he had gone through an emotional 24 hours himself, refusing to sleep last night, savoring every hour in the white house. working until the end -- less than two hours before he lost his presidential powers, he granted pardons to 140 americans, including henry cisneros, former housing secretary convicted of lying to the fbi, roger clinton, the former president's half-brother, john deutch, the former cia director who pleaded guilty yesterday to mishandling classified materials, patty hearst, and susan m dougal, a friend of the clintons who served part of her time in the jail for refusing to testify about them. it hurt my mom and dad so much to hear convicted felon. now no one can say that again. by late this afternoon, as movers transported the belongings to the home in chappaqua, he had no longer the power to grant pardons. and at a rally in new york, it was the state's new senator who got the spotlight. thank you all so much. to those who think bill clinton has seen his last hurrah, he has this to say -- "i may no longer be president, but i'll be around."

and george stephanopoulos and michael beschloss join us again. george, it was a fascinating at times, not altogether comfortable good-bye. no, but so clintonesque. look, his last day had all of the elements of the clinton era. we returned to scandal by the pardons of people like susan m dougal. there was real substance in his radio address today. he actually announced $100 million grant to put more police on the street. and speeches, speeches, speeches. it was unprecedented to have a former president give a speech after an inaugural address. he said once -- in one of his worst days, he would work up to the last minute, last hour, last day. he meant it. he sure did. even the white house aides at this morning went in and turned out the lights. michael, we journalists are always trying to turn you historians into journalists. i wonder if you think history will judge him better in how he's handled himself over the last year. since the end of the impeachment fight. i think they'll be impressed by the fact he was able to remain as effective as he could after the impeachment. but it's going to take a long time. history requires a lot more hindsight than we've got tonight and a lot more information. that could take 10, 20 years. that's not the first time you told me that. thank you both. you both had a long day.

When William Jefferson Clinton came to Washington as president-elect eight years ago this week, he transformed his journey into a sentimental extravagance: from the caravan of buses that assembled at Jefferson's old plantation in Monticello to his arrival, with fireworks, at the Lincoln Memorial. Clinton's departure from Washington _ and his presidency _ Saturday afternoon was only slightly less elaborate, from the 21-gun salute, to the crisp and elongated review of the Honor Guard, to not one but three separate hand-shaking sessions with the aides and friends who came to Andrews Air Force base. In all, it took 100 minutes from the time Clinton arrived at the farewell ceremony to the moment his Boeing 747 slipped into the clouds at 2:57 p.m. There was more rallying upon his touchdown at Kennedy International Airport. ``You see that sign there that says please don't go?'' Clinton said, gesturing at the crowd just before he left Washington, D.C. ``I left the White House _ but I'm still here!'' ``I wish you well,'' the former president of the United States said. ``You gave me the ride of my life, and I probably gave as good as I got.'' Inevitably, the man who was known for his huge appetites showed no sign of slipping easily away from a job that his friends said he was only giving up in deference to the Constitution. He issued more than 100 pardons and commutations of sentences just before leaving office in the morning, and he filled his afternoon with vivid events that assured him a spot on television alongside President Bush. And just after Clinton reached the Oval Office for the final time as president Saturday morning at about 10 a.m., he then spun around and walked back to the bay windows, to gaze one last time across the South Lawn. ``I just told him the three hardest words he's going to learn as an ex-president,'' Terry McAuliffe, his long-time friend, fund-raiser and choice to run the Democratic National Committee, said aboard the plane taking Clinton to his new home here Saturday afternoon. ``Cut it out.'' Still, the reminders that Clinton was now just another former president of the United States came up abruptly. When Bush escorted Clinton to his armored limousine after the inauguration, its side door was black, plain and shiny _ stripped of its presidential seal. By noon, Clinton's aides had turned in their pagers, cell phones, and hard collar-pins that had once assured them automatic clearance by the Secret Service. Clinton's motorcade to Andrews Air Force base actually stopped for traffic lights, and the plane he flew back on was called not Air Force One, but Special Air Mission 28000, the same plane that flew Bush's father back to Texas in defeat eight years ago. When Clinton landed in New York, it was Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton who was the featured speaker, speaking far longer than Clinton. At the rally in New York, Chelsea Clinton, who has spent almost half her life in the White House, turned to a friend and said, ``I don't even know my own phone number!'' At the new home here, reporters were waiting just outside the driveway _ something that would not have been permitted when dawn broke Saturday morning. Saying goodbye to Clinton were many friends and aides, for whom today was yet another emotionally tearing moment in an administration that had been full of them. ``It's been a great adventure,'' said Janet Reno, the former attorney general, sitting undisturbed in a folding chair as she awaited her former boss to arrive at the Andrews hangar. ``Now I'm going to go home and sit on my front porch.'' Clinton was warm and expansive as he recounted his ``bittersweet goodbye'' to the White House. ``I want all of you to know that I feel like John Podesta did,'' Clinton said, referring to his former chief of staff. As they left the Oval Office for the last time, Clinton said Podesta ``was tearing up a bit and he just said, `We did a lot of good. We did a lot of good.''' Clinton stood silent as the applause rose from the crowd. ``We did a lot of good,'' the former president said.

Former President Clinton drew cheers from admirers at a US Air Force base outside Washington today before departing for his home in New York. And although Mr. Clinton is out of office, he says he'll still be around. So you see that sign there says, "Please don't go". I left the White House, but I'm still here. go anywhere. Prior to leaving office today Mr. Clinton issued more than one hundred presidential pardons. Among those pardoned was Susan McDoogle, a former business partner of Mr. Clinton who became a key figure in the White Water Real estate investigation that plagued the Clinton presidency.

Pakistan says it will abide by the United Nations sanctions against Afghanistan's ruling Taliban movement. As Ayaz Gul reports from Islamabad, the sanctions went into effect Friday after the Taliban refused to hand over terrorist suspect Osama Bin Laden. Pakistan is a strong supporter of Afghanistan's Taliban movement and has criticized the new UN sanctions. Foreign Ministry spokesman Riyaz Mohammed Khan told reporters Saturday that Pakistan will abide by the UN sanctions. However Mr. Khan says ignoring the realities of Afghanistan will aggravate the human suffering in that war ravaged and drought stricken country. The International Community must constructively engage with Afghanistan. There will be no gain from ignoring ground realities or attempts to ostracize the Afghan government. The UN sanctions were approved by the Security Council last month after Taliban refused to hand over Saudi exile Osama Bin Laden who is wanted in the United States on terrorism charges. The sanctions, which were strongly backed by the United States and Russia, include a ban on arms sales to the Taliban, reduction of its diplomatic missions abroad and travel restrictions on Taliban officials. The arms ban excludes anti-Taliban forces in the Afghan civil war. Pakistani spokesman Khan says the one sided arms embargo on the Taliban will prolong the civil war in Afghanistan and worsen the plight of Afghans. If the military conflict is prolonged the suffering of the Afghan people will continue if not aggravated. Already we are seeing that there is an exodus of the Afghans mainly because of drought conditions and also because of the conflict conditions. Pakistan is one of only three nations that recognized Taliban's strict Islamic government in Afghanistan. The United Nations has warned of a new refugee crisis stemming from the civil war and drought in Afghanistan. The UN refugee agency says Pakistan has received up to 120,000 Afghan refugees in the last three months. According to the United Nations some 1.2 million Afghan refugees already live in camps in Pakistan. Mr. Khan urges the United Nations to step up its efforts to stem the flow of refugees. He says the new burden is beyond Pakistan's stretched resources. In Afghanistan the International Community faces the gravest humanitarian challenge of our day. Moral and humanitarian imperatives require a full engagement and concerted efforts by the International Community to address the problem of Afghan refugees and of hunger and deprivation inside Afghanistan. Humanitarian groups have warned that one million Afghans face starvation unless they receive relief in the coming months. For VOA News this is Ayaz Gul in Islamabad.

The wife of an inmate who at one point would have been in line to be the first person executed by the federal government since 1963 said ``God bless President Clinton'' for commuting the death sentence on Saturday. David Ronald Chandler, held in a federal prison at Terre Haute, Ind., was one of 36 people whose sentences were commuted at the same time that the president pardoned 140 others. Chandler was convicted in 1991 of running a drug ring that trafficked marijuana from the foothills of northeast Alabama and was condemned to death for ordering the murder of an associate-turned-informant. He was the first person sentenced to die under a 1988 drug law, but appeals effectively put off the setting of an execution date. Chandler's sentence will be changed to life without parole, said Calhoun County District Attorney Joseph Hubbard, who helped prosecute Chandler. Chandler's wife, Deborah, said Saturday that she had been praying that Clinton would commute the death sentence. ``God bless President Clinton,'' she said. Chandler ``always said God would clear his name,'' she added. Chandler contends he is innocent of the killing of Martin Shuler, and the government's main witness has recanted testimony that linked Chandler to the slaying. ``We kept praying for him to get back to court,'' said Deborah Chandler. The couple have three children. A three-judge panel of the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals voted 2-1 in October 1999 to overturn the death sentence, but an 11-judge panel reversed that decision in July, voting 6-5 to reject a claim that he did not receive effective representation by his trial lawyer. However, even the judges who rejected his petition in July wrote that ``evidence of guilt was not overwhelming.'' The case was expected to go the U.S. Supreme Court, Hubbard noted. In the meantime, Timothy McVeigh is in line to become the first person put to death by the federal government in nearly 40 years. He is scheduled to die by injection May 16 at the Terre Haute prison for blowing up the federal building in Oklahoma City in 1995, killing 168 people. Hubbard maintained that Chandler is not innocent and called the decision ``another stain'' on Clinton's legacy. He said he had sent letters of protest to Clinton and Attorney General Janet Reno after learning of the proposed commutation several days earlier. ``My thoughts are it's an unwarranted intervention into the judicial process. This case is not over with in the courts,'' Hubbard said.

Overwhelmed by grinding poverty and instability, the streets of this Central African capital buzzed Saturday with fears for the future under Joseph Kabila who is succeeding his assassinated father as president. Many see few differences between the new president and his father, gunned down Tuesday in his palace after 3 1/2 years of steadily eroding rule. ``The father was a bad guy. The son will also be a bad guy. Everybody is suffering,'' said street vendor Elisabeth Ntumba, 55, as she waited for customers at a table scattered with some soap, a can of tomato paste, a few peanuts and meager wares she hawks to support her nine children. Life in the Congolese capital has steadily deteriorated in recent years. The country was left in ruins by the late dictator Mobutu Sese Seko, who became one of the world's richest men by plundering the vast mineral wealth of Africa's third-largest country. More than two years of civil war under Kabila only accelerated the country's economic slide. Though the fighting remains far away, Kinshasa has seen spiraling prices for food, education and health care that have many fed up and calling for change. ``There's a big deterioration, day by day,'' said Mbinge-Mbinge Devos, a 25-year-old university student. ``There is no progress in life. People are staying in the same place. There are no jobs. Life is very tough.'' Many doubt that Joseph Kabila, whose character and political beliefs are virtually unknown, can deliver the turnaround the country sorely needs. Some simply want the young president to emerge from the cloak of secrecy that surrounded his father's rule and declare a new course for the country. ``If he finds solutions to the problems, then he can stay,'' said Philippe Efihli, 46. ``If not, then he must go.'' Efihli is feeling the crunch of inflation. A few years ago all five of his children were enrolled in school. Now his weekly salary of $3.60 and the supplementary income his wife makes selling homegrown vegetables is only enough to educate two children. ``The country is not going very well. Eating is a problem,'' Efihli said. ``We have never had a good leader.'' Many families survive only because they grow maize, cassava and other vegetables on plots near their homes. Meat is such a rarity that Tony Costa, a 25-year-old university student, plans to slaughter his pet monkey for food in April, when it has grown bigger. ``Before, buying meat was not a problem,'' he said. ``Now, I only eat vegetables.'' Costa has little hope that the younger Kabila will bring change, stating flatly that ``the insecurity will not end tomorrow.'' Some point to their new leader's age _ Joseph is said to be around 30 years old, but his exact date of birth is a mystery. Others criticize his ethnicity _ his mother is rumored to be a Tutsi, the dominant ethnic group in Rwanda, who are widely despised by the Congolese. And even worse is a leadership succession that smacks of royalty. ``Congo is not a kingdom where the son must take over,'' Devos said. The elder Kabila led a rebellion that overthrew the decades-long rule of Mobutu in 1997. One year later, he in turn faced a rebellion launched by Congolese Tutsis, disaffected Congolese soldiers and opposition politicians with the support of Rwanda and Uganda _ his former allies. Fighting continues, despite a cease-fire signed by all sides, and Kabila has demonstrated no inclination to end the hostilities. Ntumba, the street vendor, is praying that changes. ``We need peace. I'm praying for peace,'' she said. ``If there is war, we will die.''

President Clinton ended his tenure Saturday by pardoning 140 Americans, erasing the criminal records of his brother Roger, Whitewater business partner Susan McDougal and 1970s kidnapped heiress Patricia Hearst in a mix of personal and historical acts of clemency. The orders Clinton signed two hours before leaving office also spared one man from execution and cleared the cloud of scandal from two former Cabinet confidants _ ex-CIA director John Deutch and ex-housing chief Henry Cisneros. Deutch had been discussing a possible plea deal with Justice Department prosecutors to settle allegations he mishandled classified government information when the pardon muted his case. He was not alone. Former Arizona Gov. Fife Symington also received a pardon that effectively ends prosecutors efforts to restore criminal charges against him. ``I'm humbled and gratified,'' said Symington, a Republican convicted in 1997 on six of counts of bank and wire fraud who later overturned the charges on appeal. The list, which included 36 commutations, also was notable for those it did not include: Webster Hubbell, a former law partner of Hillary Rodham Clinton convicted in the Whitewater investigation, had not sought a pardon; Jonathan Pollard, a former Navy analyst imprisoned for spying for Israel; one-time Wall Street financier Michael Milken; former senator and Abscam figure Harrison Williams; and Leonard Peltier, convicted of killing two FBI agents on an Indian reservation in 1975. He did, however, pardon fugitive commodities trader Marc Rich, who fled to Switzerland in the 1980s to escape federal charges of financial fraud, tax evasion and racketeering. The Swiss had refused to extradite him. Clinton, himself spared from indictment in a deal Friday with prosecutors, also commuted the prison sentences of 35 people and the death sentence of an Alabama man. The president spared David Ronald Chandler from being executed in an Alabama drug case in which questions have been raised about his federal conviction for ordering the murder of an associate-turned-informant. Chandler must remain in prison. ``God bless President Clinton,'' said Chandler's wife, Deborah. ``We kept praying for him to get back to court.'' Others who prison sentences were commuted included: _former Navajo Nation leader Peter MacDonald, sent to prison in connection with a bloody riot in 1989. _former Chicago area Rep. Melvin J. Reynolds, sent to prison for engaging in bank fraud and campaign violations and having sex with an underage campaign worker. _Susan Rosenberg, a 1970s activist who was sentenced to 58 years in prison for her participation in the bungled 1981 Brink's armored car robbery that left two policemen and a guard dead in Rockland County, N.Y. In prison, Rosenberg has renounced all radical activity and been a model prisoner. _Linda Sue Evans, 53, who was sentenced to 40 years in prison for her part in a conspiracy to stage a bombing at the U.S. Capitol in 1983 to protest the U.S. invasion of Grenada, as well as for illegally buying firearms. Clinton and his staff labored over the pardons _ some intensely personal, others more traditional _ for several hours in his final days. They settled on a list in the wee hours Saturday, but the president asked to sleep on it before signing the orders. One of the final decisions left to be made concerned McDougal, the former business partner who went to prison rather than give testimony about the president sought by Whitewater prosecutors. ``I am so grateful,'' she said. ``There are tears down my face right now, I don't think I stopped crying since I saw the announcement.'' McDougal was convicted of fraud along with her ex-husband, the late failed savings and loan owner James McDougal, in a 1996 trial at which Clinton testified by videotape. She said she was anxious about her pardon request, wondering if the Clintons harbored any anger toward her. ``It might have been human nature to hold some anger toward me because the investigation had to do with business dealings my husband and I had with them,'' she said. McDougal's pardon came just one day after the Whitewater investigation was closed down under a deal in which Clinton gave up his law license and admitted make false testimony under oath about Monica Lewinsky in return for prosecutors agreeing not to indict him. A lesser known Whitewater figure, Stephen A. Smith, also was pardoned. Smith, a former aide to Clinton when he was Arkansas governor, had been convicted of a misdemeanor in 1995 in the Whitewater probe. McDougal only served 3 1/2 months of a two-year prison term for her four felony convictions before a federal judge released her because of a back problem. But her freedom was short-lived. She defied a judge's order to answer Whitewater prosecutor's questions before a federal grand jury and was returned to jail for 18 months for civil contempt. Roger Clinton, Bill Clinton's under-achieving half brother, was sentenced to two years in prison after pleading guilty in 1985 to conspiring to distribute cocaine. He cooperated with authorities and testified against other drug defendants. He has since focused on an entertainment career. Hearst grabbed headlines in the 1970s when, as a 19-year-old heiress, she was kidnapped by the radical Symbionese Liberation Army. She was later sent to prison for a bank holdup in San Francisco. Her prison term was cut short by President Carter, but her convictions remained on record until Clinton's pardon. MacDonald, 72, the ailing former Navajo leader, has been in a Fort Worth, Texas, medical prison since 1992. He was one of the famed Navajos used by the U.S. military during World War II to stump the Japanese by using their native tongue as a communications code. He later rose to chairman of America's largest Native American tribe, but became ensnared in controversy and eventually was sentenced for his role in a Window Rock, Ariz., riot that killed two in 1989. Deutch's pardon spared the one-time spy chief and top Pentagon official from deciding whether to enter a misdemeanor plea deal in connection with his mishandling of national secrets on a home computer. Cisneros was Clinton's first housing secretary. He resigned in 1996 amid an investigation into allegations that he lied to the FBI about payments he made to a former mistress. In 1999, he pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge.

George Walker Bush, swearing the same oath as his father before him, became America's 43rd president Saturday, pledging to ``build a single nation of justice and opportunity'' after one of the most turbulent elections in history. Bush said he would lead with ``civility, courage, compassion and character.'' Seven members of his Cabinet won swift Senate approval as the Republicans moved in after eight years of Democratic rule. On a day blending inaugural pageantry and protests, Bush succeeded Bill Clinton with a promise to heal the nation's divisions. ``People say, `Well, gosh, the election was so close, nothing will happen, except for finger pointing and name calling and bitterness,'' Bush said at a luncheon with congressional leaders. ``I'm here to tell the country that things will get done, that we're going to rise above expectations, that both Republicans and Democrats will come together to do what's right for America.'' The inauguration, witnessed by a crowd stretching out from the West Front of the Capitol, marked the opening of the first Republican-controlled White House and Congress since the Eisenhower era. Spectators were bundled in heavy coats and ponchos on a cold, raw day. Police in riot gear stood five deep between Bush's motorcade and protesters on the inaugural parade route. An egg was thrown from a group of demonstrators toward Bush's limousine, startling Secret Service agents. A few blocks later an orange was tossed toward his car, rolling past. Police pinned down two protesters who jumped security barriers and got within 30 feet of the limousine. The new president delighted onlookers when he got out of his car. Protected by heavy security, he walked the last block of the parade holding hands with his wife. Bush and his extended family watched the inaugural parade with umbrellas overhead during an intermittent hard rain. There were bands, floats, riders on horseback, a precision lawn chair demonstration team _ even a group of Idaho women in red house dresses and blue aprons who danced with shopping carts. It was a pomp-filled end to a campaign which saw Bush finish second in the popular vote but a narrow winner in the all-important electoral competition. Departing Vice President Al Gore, Bush's defeated rival, watched the proceedings stoically, a silent reminder of the five-week post-election battle that was stopped by the Supreme Court. Richard Cheney was sworn is as vice president at 11:57 a.m. Bush followed at 12:02 p.m., then reached for his father's right hand and hugged him, putting his left hand around his dad's head. The senior Bush wiped away a tear and the new president's eyes welled up, too. It was the second time in American history a son had followed his father to the White House. John Quincy Adams traced his father's steps 176 years ago. A traditional 21-gun salute marked the change of command as Bush fought back tears again _ and snapped a salute to the crowd _ after the National Anthem was played. In one of his first acts, Bush formally submitted his Cabinet nominations to the Senate. Among those quickly confirmed and sworn into office were Colin Powell as secretary of state, Donald Rumsfeld as defense secretary, Paul O'Neill as treasury secretary and Spencer Abraham as energy secretary. Bush signed an executive order establishing ethical standards for his new administration, and moved to halt Clinton's blizzard of executive orders and rules. Among the targets were new Medicare guidelines and environmental protections. The president also ordered a temporary federal hiring freeze until his new Cabinet members are in place. In a 15-minute inaugural address, Bush thanked Gore for ``a contest conducted with spirit and ended with grace.'' Pledging to work for reconciliation, Bush said, ``Sometimes our differences run so deep it seems we share a continent but not a country. ``We do not accept this and will not allow it,'' Bush declared. ``Our unity, our union, is the serious work of leaders and citizens in every generation. And this is my solemn pledge: I will work to build a single nation of justice and opportunity.'' His promise brought a burst of applause from spectators. It was a day of triumph and glory for the new president and his family, which bears one of the most prominent names in American politics. It began with worship at St. John's Episcopal Church, across Lafayette Park from the White House, and ran late into the night with eight black-tie inaugural balls drawing almost 50,000 revelers. ``I'm looking forward to getting to work. There's a lot to be done but before we start to work there's some dancing to be done,'' he told the cheering crowd at the Texas-Wyoming ball, held in part of the Washington Convention Center. Bush's father, the nation's 41st president but vanquished by Clinton in 1992, watched with pride as his son swore his oath, his left hand resting on the same Bible that George Washington used. Former first lady Barbara Bush watched with a smile, wearing a transparent rain poncho. A black limousine, its flags snapping in the wind, carried Bush and Clinton to the Capitol after their meeting at the White House. Clinton left office with 11th hour pardons for 140 Americans, including his former Whitewater business partner Susan McDougal, brother Roger Clinton, who spent two years in jail in the 1980s on a drug charge, and former CIA Director John Deutch, accused of mishandling national secrets on a home computer. Another pardon went to Patricia Campbell Hearst Shaw for her actions in the 1970s as Patty Hearst. In the final moments before Bush came calling, Clinton and his wife, Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton, were spotted through a window dancing together in the foyer. When the new first family arrived, Bush's wife Laura greeted Mrs. Clinton with, ``Good morning, senator.'' Clinton wasn't leaving quietly. He spoke to wistful supporters _ including Cabinet and staff _ at an unusual rally at Andrews Air Force Base before flying to New York, his newly adopted home state. ``I left the White House but I'm still here,'' he said at one point. ``We're not going anywhere.'' Aides organized a second rally to welcome Clinton to New York. As Bush took his oath of office, wife Laura held the Bible, a wide smile on her face. Twin daughters, 19-year-olds Jenna and Barbara, watched expectantly and broke into grins as their dad finished. A smile kept crossing as he recited the oath. He breathed a deep sigh at the end. Bush was sworn in by Chief Justice William Rehnquist, who voted with the majority in the 5-4 decision that handed him the presidency. Bush offered a special message to Americans who ``doubt the promise, even the justice, of our own country,'' promising that he would strive to ensure opportunity and equality for all. He found scant support among minority voters in the disputed election; blacks opposed him 10 to 1 and some still question the legitimacy of his victory. Democratic Rep. William Jefferson, a black lawmaker from Louisiana, said most Democrats came to the inauguration because ``we realize we have to go on with out responsibilities.'' But Jefferson also said he couldn't help but think about ``the opportunities lost'' with Gore's defeat. Bush promised to make America ``more just and generous'' and set a handful of specific goals: _ Action to ``reclaim America's schools.'' _ Reform of Social Security and Medicare. _ Tax cuts ``to recover the momentum of our economy'' and reward the effort of working Americans. _ A national defense ``beyond challenge,'' and action to confront ``weapons of mass destruction,'' the national missile defense system he advocates. Bush won office in the closest presidential election in 124 years. Gore received 539,947 more votes than Bush on Nov. 7 but, when the battle for Florida ended in the Supreme Court five weeks later, Bush had 271 electoral votes, one more than a majority. Gore had 267. The new president inherits a Congress sharply divided, with an evenly split Senate, the first since 1881, and a House in which Republicans hold only a five-vote edge. Cheney's tie-breaking Senate vote gives Republicans the edge there.

Congo's crumbling capital on Sunday received the body of its slain president, Laurent Kabila, four years after his rebel army was welcomed for ousting the late dictator Mobutu Sese Seko. His son and newly installed leader Joseph Kabila, surrounded by soldiers from Congo and military ally Angola, wept as his father's casket was taken off the presidential plane and marched across the tarmac to a waiting open-top trailer. Joseph Kabila, who forsook his normal military uniform in favor of dark civilian clothes, walked behind the casket as it was carried past two rows of sobbing officials. Six military brass strained to heave the casket onto a trailer as another officer led the procession with a large portrait of the slain president. The casket arrived in Kinshasa around midday after being flown from Kabila's southwestern home city of Lubumbashi, 1,000 miles southeast of the capital. The plane flew especially low over Kinshasa before landing. In preparation for a public memorial ceremony planned later in the day, palm fronds were draped as a symbol of mourning across car windshields and in front of shops and hotels. Thin crowds lined the main road leading from the airport into the city, although few people showed any emotion as they waited for a glimpse of the funeral procession. The march was broadcast live on state television. ``All of Kinshasa is crying for Laurent Desire Kabila,'' an announcer said. After taking power in a rebel march across this sweeping Central African nation in May 1997, Kabila was initially hailed by Kinshasa residents as a hero. Those feelings were soon replaced by resentment as his corrupt grip on power began to resemble Mobutu, the 30-year dictator that he toppled. There were signs that Congolese authorities were taking no chances that Kabila's unpopularity would mar Sunday's memorial ceremony. A heavy military presence was staked out at the open-air Palace of the People where the service was to be held. At intersections and marketplaces, soldiers violently confiscated necklaces and earrings from a number of women, arguing that jewelry was disrespectful during a 30-day mourning period, witnesses said on condition of anonymity. Journalists saw three women running from a market with ears bleeding. At the Simba Zikida marketplace in southeast Kinshasa, shop owners were commanded by local authorities to attend Sunday's service, witnesses said. ``They cannot force people to mourn. Even if it were my own father I would not accept it,'' said one shopper, who identified herself as Honorine. ``But I'm afraid the soldiers will make trouble against the people.'' Details of the shooting remain murky. Justice Minister Mwenze Kongolo said Saturday Kabila was shot Tuesday by a bodyguard while he sat at his desk. The assassin, now dead, approached Kabila as if to tell him something and shot him once behind the ear and then twice in the stomach, Kongolo said. At least one presidential guardsman was arrested Friday in connection with the assassination, another guard said Sunday on condition of anonymity. Several other soldiers were reportedly arrested earlier. Zambian President Frederik Chiluba, a sometime peace negotiator between Congo's warring sides, on Sunday said the circumstances of Kabila's death ``have yet again cast a dark shadow on the rule of law in our continent.'' ``This is a tragedy for the Democratic Republic of Congo which has been desperately searching for and has not known peace and stability in the past two years,'' Chiluba said. Rebels have been fighting Kabila's government since 1998, backed by troops from Rwanda and Uganda. Kabila has been supported by Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia.

Afghanistan's ruling Taliban militia denied allegations Sunday that its troops executed 100 innocent civilians after recapturing territory largely inhabited by the country's minority Shiite Muslims. U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said Friday the United Nations had received information that Taliban soldiers summarily executed the civilians while taking back Yakaolang, a key town, in central Bamiyan province, 130 miles northwest of the capital, Kabul. The Taliban, who espouse a harsh brand of Islamic law, rule 95 percent of Afghanistan and their opponents the remaining 5 percent. ``We never kill civilians. There is no truth in the U.N. charges,'' Haqzar Akhund, the Taliban's deputy interior minister told The Associated Press. ``Instead of making unfair allegations against us, U.N. officials and journalists should go there and see that we have restored peace and security in the area.'' The area is home to ethnic Hazaras, who are mostly Shiite Muslims. The Taliban _ and most others Afghanis _ are overwhelmingly Sunni Muslims and Pashtun. The Taliban have repeatedly denied accusations that they target the country's minority ethnic and religious groups. Meanwhile, the Taliban said they were preparing to reduce their diplomatic staff in neighboring Pakistan in keeping with U.N. sanctions that took effect last Friday. Despite being the staunchest Taliban ally, Pakistan has agreed to abide by the sanctions, imposed to press the Taliban to hand over suspected terrorist mastermind Osama bin Laden. The Taliban have refused to deliver bin Laden, saying he is a guest in their country. They say they want proof of his involvement in terrorist activity before handing him over. The sanctions impose an arms embargo against the Taliban, but not against their northern-based opposition. The provisions also order Taliban diplomatic missions to be reduced, other Taliban offices closed and bans international travel by Taliban leaders. ``We will reduce diplomatic staff ourselves so that Pakistan doesn't face any difficulty,'' said Abdul Salam Zaeef, the Taliban ambassador to Pakistan in Islamabad. ``The list of staff has already been sent to our supreme leader Mullah Mohammed Omar, who will make the final decision.'' Washington accuses bin Laden of masterminding the twin bombings of its embassies in East Africa in 1998. He also is the leading suspect in last year's bombing of the USS Cole that killed 17 American sailors.

questions are emerging tonight about some of the last-minute pardons granted by bill clinton yesterday. there were 140 in all. one name on the list, marc rich, isn't as well-known to the public as patty hearst and susan m dougal. who were also pardoned. but law enforcement officials know rich very well. they've been chasing him for years. here's abc's josh gerstein. as president clinton spent his first full day as a private citizen in chappaqua, new york, he was asked to explain the 140 pardons he granted just hours before leaving office. you're not saying, these people didn't commit the offense. you're saying, thepaid. they paid in full. the vast majority of the pardons went to people who had already paid their debt to society. but one went to marc rich, a billionaire oil trader who fled to switzerland in 1983, just as he was being indicted on 65 counts of tax evasion, racketeering and other charges. rich was also accused of trading with iran during the hostage crisis. his companies paid roughly $200 million in fines, but u.s. marshals spent 17 years trying to capture rich in europe. new york mayor ry giuliani was once a prosecutor on the case. i'm shocked that the president of the united states would pardon him. after all, he never paid a price. he got on an airplane, took all of his records and r off to switzerland, where he's remained a fugitive since then, spending money buying the town. and has made untold efforts to try to get the charges reduced, including many, man overtures based on the use of influence. rich's ex-wife, denise, is close to president clinton. she is a devoted fund-raiser who has contributed more than $600,000 to democratic causes in recent years. mr. clinton said he gave rich's case careful consideration. i spent a lot of time on that case. i think there are very good reasons for it. and i couldn't say them any better than jack quinn, mr. rich's attorney. jack quinn used to be president clinton's white hoe counsel. he managed to persuade his former boss that changes in the law in the last 17 years undercut the charges against rich, and that it might be tough for the billionaire to ever get a fair trial. josh gerstein, abc news, new york.

off the coast of ecuador, a u.s. coast guard team has arrived to help clean up the damage from a serious oil spill in the galapagos islands. officials fear it is a major environmental disaster in the making. they are one of the world's environmental marvels -- isolated 600 miles off the northwest coast of south america, the galapagos islands are famed for their wildlife, its giant tortoises and rare species of birds inspired charles darwin's theory of evolution. today they are threatened by a tanker that was carrying fuel to the islands. it ran aground last week and began spilling oil friday. already 120,000 gallons fuel are believed to have leaked, damaging wildlife on the galapagos' eastern-most islands, san cristobal. ecuador's environmental minister rodolfo rendon, is on the islands. we spoke to him by phone. it is a very, very serious environmental problem. and we are working so it won't be a disaster. officials say currents are pushing the spill toward one of the largest colonies of sea lions. ecuadorian crews are trying to control the leak by setting up a fence to trap it, and using chemicals to neutralize. they are also taking oil off the grounded tanker, but so far they've only managed to retrieve 20,000 gallons. tens of thousands more are still on board.

Four points from defeat, Pete Sampras crouched behind the baseline to receive serve, desperate for a sign of shakiness by Todd Martin. A veteran player known to blow a lead, Martin was now trying to serve out an upset victory against a friend who had beaten him 13 times in a row. With a berth in the quarterfinals of the Australian Open at stake, Martin wavered only briefly. He rushed a forehand into the net, then smacked two serves that Sampras couldn't handle, put away a difficult volley and belted another service winner to complete a 6-7 (2), 6-3, 6-4, 6-4 victory. ``I give him all the credit in the world,'' the third-seeded Sampras said. ``I don't think I played poorly. I played fine. He just played better than I did. That's the best he has played against me in many years.'' The upset spoiled a potential showdown Tuesday between Sampras and defending champion Andre Agassi. Instead, Martin will get the chance to avenge a painful loss last year at Wimbledon, when he blew a 5-2 fifth-set lead against Agassi and was unable to convert two match points. ``Today proved to me that I can serve out a match,'' Martin said. Sampras' defeat left the tournament without its three top seeded men. No. 2 Marat Safin lost Sunday to No. 14 Dominik Hrbaty 6-2, 7-6 (6), 6-4, and No. 1 Gustavo Kuerten was eliminated Thursday. Hrbaty's next opponent will be No. 12 Patrick Rafter, who ousted No. 8 Tim Henman 6-2, 6-3, 6-3. Rafter reached the quarterfinals of his country's biggest tournament for the first time just days after announcing he may retire at year's end. Two women's quarterfinal matchups were determined Sunday: No. 4 Monica Seles against No. 12 Jennifer Capriati, and No. 8 Anna Kournikova against No. 2 Lindsay Davenport, the defending champion. There will be talk that Sampras' defeat is another sign of his decline, particularly in the wake of the drubbing Safin administered to him in the U.S. Open final last September. But in both matches, Sampras simply ran into a red-hot player. ``I would assume Andre Agassi is pretty darned pleased Pete lost today,'' Martin said. ``A couple of other guys might be as well. In my mind he's still the best player in the world.'' Sampras was not at his best in Melbourne, struggling through a trio of three-hour victories before losing. Usually dominant with his serve, he was broken 17 times in four matches, and he failed to snap his streak of not winning a major event other than Wimbledon since the 1997 Australian Open. But at 29, Sampras remains hungry to add to his record 13 Grand Slam titles. He has even committed to a full clay-court season in preparation for the only major tournament to elude him, the French Open. ``I feel like I can still win majors, and I'd like to win a couple more before it's all said and done,'' he said. ``I know I can do it. It's disappointing not to do it here, but I've got many years and many Slams ahead of me.'' The weather, mild Sunday after two scorching days, wasn't a factor in Sampras' latest loss. Recurring foot blisters _ common for him on the Australian Open's Rebound Ace surface _ weren't a factor either, he said. The problem was Martin, whose losing streak against Sampras dated to 1995. Martin lost to his fellow American in tournaments large and small, outdoors and indoors, on hardcourts, carpet and clay. But this time he out-served Sampras and had the better return as well. In the second set, Martin cracked three return winners to break for a 5-3 lead, then served out the set to even the match. He broke again in the third game of the next set to take the lead for good. ``I don't know what I could have done,'' Sampras said. ``I needed for him to drop off a little bit.'' It didn't happen; Martin refused to crack and remained calm even after the final point. Instead of a jubilant display in victory, Martin met Sampras at the net with a sympathetic pat on the back. ``Pete's a friend of mine, and I don't like to see him lose,'' Martin said. ``But if I have to see him lose, I'd just as soon it be to me.''

Biographic sketches of some of the prominent people on President Clinton's list of pardons and commutations, issued Saturday before leaving office: COMMUTATIONS: DAVID RONALD CHANDLER Chandler at one point was in line to be the first person executed by the federal government since 1963. He was convicted in 1991 of running a drug ring that trafficked marijuana from the foothills of northeast Alabama and was condemned to death for ordering the murder of an associate-turned-informant. He was the first person sentenced to die under a 1988 drug law, and was given a March 30, 1995, execution date. However, a federal judge blocked the execution to give the courts more time to consider issues raised by Chandler's appeals. JACOB ELBAUM Elbaum, 40, was one of three Hasidic Jews from Rockland County, New York, convicted in January 1999 of stealing tens of millions of dollars in federal grants and loans to finance a fictitious yeshiva in Brooklyn. They were ordered to repay the money in fines and were sentenced to serve sentences ranging from two years to seven years in prison. The commutation reduced each man's sentence to 30 months. LINDA SUE EVANS Evans, 53, was ordered in 1990 to serve five years for her role in a bombing conspiracy at the U.S. Capitol after completing a 35-year term she was already serving for illegally buying firearms. Evans also pleaded guilty to conspiring to set off explosions at eight locations in a two-year campaign of ``armed propaganda'' to protest government policies. DAVID GOLDSTEIN Goldstein, 54, was one of three men from a community of Hasidic Jews in Rockland County, New York, convicted in January 1999 of stealing tens of millions of dollars in federal grants and loans to finance a fictitious yeshiva in Brooklyn. They were ordered to repay the money in fines and were sentenced to serve sentences ranging from two years to seven years in prison. The commutation reduced each man's sentence to 30 months. ARNOLD PAUL PROSPERI Prosperi, 52, a college friend of Bill Clinton and a fund-raiser for him, was convicted of filing false tax returns and scheming to steal millions from a client. Prosecutors said the prominent Hobe Sound, Fla., lawyer wrote himself checks from the accounts of an offshore company set up by the client, an Irish citizen. He was sentenced in 1998 to three years in prison. Prosperi suffers from myasthenia gravis, an illness that causes extreme muscle weakness. MELVIN REYNOLDS Reynolds, 47, a Chicago Democrat, resigned from the House after being convicted in 1995 of having sex with a teen-ager. He had more than two years left to serve on a 6 1/2-year federal sentence imposed after being convicted of lying to obtain loans and of illegally diverting campaign money for personal use. He had previously served 2 1/2 years of a five-year state sentence for having sexual relations with an underage campaign worker. SUSAN ROSENBERG In 1984, Rosenberg was found guilty of weapons possession and sentenced to 58 years in prison for her participation in the bungled 1981 Brink's armored car robbery that left two policemen and a guard dead in Rockland County, N.Y. She was also arrested in the 1983 Capitol bombing, but the charges were later dropped. In prison, Rosenberg has renounced all radical activity and been a model prisoner. KALMEN STERN Stern, 42, was one of three men from a community of Hasidic Jews in Rockland County, New York, convicted in January 1999 of stealing tens of millions of dollars in federal grants and loans to finance a fictitious yeshiva in Brooklyn. They were ordered to repay the money in fines and were sentenced to serve sentences ranging from two years to seven years in prison. The commutation reduced each man's sentence to 30 months. PARDONS: WILLIAM STERLING ANDERSON Anderson, 58, a former South Carolina House Speaker Pro Tem, was sentenced to 14 months in prison in January 1987 for charges stemming from the falsification of customer credit records for his mobile home business in South Carolina. WILLIAM A. BORDERS JR. The once-prominent Washington attorney and former president of the National Bar Association was convicted of conspiracy along with then-U.S. District Judge Alcee L. Hastings in a Miami racketeering case. While Hastings was acquitted, Borders was sentenced to a five-year prison term and disbarred. Borders was also held in contempt of court for refusing to testify during Hasting's criminal and Senate impeachment trials. JOHN BUSTAMANTE Bustamante, 70, was a pillar of Cleveland's black community as chairman of First National Bank Association of Cleveland and publisher of the Call and Post newspaper. He pleaded guilty in 1993 to a federal charge of defrauding an insurance company and was placed on probation. He pleaded after a federal judge threw out his 1991 conviction on five felony fraud charges. HENRY CISNEROS Cisneros, 52, was housing secretary during Clinton's first term before moving to Los Angeles to run Univision, the nation's largest Spanish-language television network. In 1999, Cisneros pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor after a four-year, $9 million probe into charges he lied about payments to a former mistress. DONALD R. CLARK Clark, 60, was sentenced to life in prison in 1991 for his role in a $30 million high-grade marijuana ring. Clark was one of the leaders in a conspiracy to grow and sell ``Myakka gold,'' an especially potent marijuana grown on a 600-acre former sod and watermelon farm leased by Clark in Myakka City, near Sarasota, Fla. More than 25 people, including Clark's sons Duane and Gary, were indicted in the drug ring. ROGER CLINTON President Clinton's half brother pleaded guilty in a 1984 case to a charge of conspiracy to distribute a single gram of cocaine, was sentenced to two years in prison, served more than a year, and testified in other trials. The prosecutor was Asa Hutchinson, who later was a U.S. House manager in President Clinton's impeachment. Bill Clinton told Hutchinson later that the drug prosecution was ``the best thing that ever happened'' to his half brother. JOHN DEUTCH Deutch, 61, CIA director from May 1995 to December 1996, stored and processed hundreds of files of highly classified material on unprotected home computers that he and family members also used to connect to the Internet, according to an internal CIA investigation. The Defense Department's inspector general found similar conduct during Deutch's prior service at the Pentagon. Prosecutors offered Deutch a deal under which he would plead guilty to keeping government secrets on unsecured home computers and receive no prison time. WILLIAM FUGAZY SR. The one-time limousine mogul was a former confidant of New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and ex-New York Gov. Mario Cuomo. In 1997, after going bankrupt, Fugazy pleaded guilty to shifting some of his remaining assets into another company controlled by his children to avoid paying creditors who claimed he owed them $75 million. He was sentenced to two years of probation for committing perjury. PATRICIA HEARST Hearst, 45, was a 19-year-old newspaper heiress who was kidnapped by radicals in 1974 and convicted of joining them in a San Francisco bank heist. She claimed she was brainwashed by her Symbionese Liberation Army captors and forced to participate in the armed robbery. President Carter commuted her seven-year sentence after she had served 21 months. BILLY LANGSTON Langston, 46, a first-time offender, was sentenced to 30 years in prison in 1994 for conspiracy to manufacture PCP. His sentence became a symbol for groups opposed to mandatory federal sentencing standards. Arrested while transporting drug-making chemicals, a job for which he was paid $1,000, he said he never manufactured PCP, didn't purchase the chemicals and didn't believe he was at risk for arrest ``because you could get the chemicals over the counter.'' PETER MACDONALD MacDonald, 72, former president of the Navajo Nation, had served over half of a 14-year sentence for his role in a July 1989 riot in Window Rock, Ariz., that killed two of his supporters. The melee followed five months of tension and other violence among members of the nation's largest tribe after MacDonald was suspended from office by the Navajo Tribal Council on suspicion he had accepted kickbacks from contractors and cronies. On July 20, 1989, a group of his supporters stormed tribal headquarters in Window Rock in an attempt to restore him to power. Tribal police opened fire, killing two MacDonald supporters. SUSAN MCDOUGAL McDougal, 46, was a partner of Bill and Hillary Rodham Clinton in the Whitewater land development in northern Arkansas. She was convicted of misusing proceeds from a federally backed loan and was jailed 18 months on a contempt of court citation for refusing to testify against the Clintons before a Whitewater grand jury. She was acquitted in a separate obstruction of justice trial. HOWARD LAWRENCE MECHANIC Mechanic fled after a federal judge sentenced him in 1972 to serve five years for throwing a cherry bomb during a war protest at Washington University in St. Louis. He changed his name to Gary Tredway and ran a motel-apartment complex and health-food business in Scottsdale, Ariz. He continued his social activism, attending City Council meetings and pushing for clean elections and environmental causes, and his secret was discovered when he ran for the Scottsdale City Council. SAMUEL LORING MORISON Morison, employed at the Naval Intelligence Support Center in Suitland, Md., from 1974 to 1984, was convicted of spying for leaking intelligence photographs in 1984 to Jane's Defence Weekly, a British military magazine. In a case that matched First Amendment issues against national security concerns, Morison was the first person convicted of espionage for furnishing classified data to a journalist. He served two years in jail. ROBERT W. PALMER Palmer, a Whitewater defendant, pleaded guilty to a felony count of conspiracy to file false appraisals for Madison Guaranty Savings and Loan of Little Rock, which was owned by James McDougal, a former business partner of President Clinton. He was sentenced to a year of home detention. CHARLES ``PUG'' RAVENEL Ravenel, 62, a former gubernatorial candidate, pleaded guilty in October 1995 to his role in the failure of the Citadel Federal Savings Bank, which prosecutors called one of the biggest bank frauds in the state's history. He was sentenced to 11 months in federal prison. MARC RICH The billionaire commodities trader was convicted in the early 1980s on 51 counts of conspiracy, tax evasion, racketeering and trading with the enemy. Before his trial, he fled to Switzerland to escape the charges. Switzerland has refused to extradite him. STEPHEN A. SMITH Smith, a University of Arkansas communications professor, pleaded guilty in a Whitewater case to a misdemeanor count of conspiring to misapply funds from a federally backed business loan of $65,000. He said that paying a $1,000 fine was better than spending $70,000 for lawyers to prove his innocence. CORY STRINGFELLOW Stringfellow, 31, was sentenced to 188 months in federal prison in 1995 for conspiring to sell LSD and fleeing to England. Salt Lake Mayor Rocky Anderson and Utah's two senators lobbied for Stringfellow, arguing the offense was non-violent and happened in his youth. JOHN FIFE SYMINGTON III The former Republican governor of Arizona resigned after being convicted in 1997 of using false financial statements to obtain loans. An appeals court overturned his convictions and prosecutors were still pursuing the case against him. He still faces a civil case in U.S. Bankruptcy Court stemming from a $10 million loan to six union pension funds. CHRISTOPHER V. WADE Wade, a Whitewater real estate agent, admitted hiding assets in a bankruptcy case and pleaded guilty to bankruptcy fraud and submitting a false application to a bank, though the charges against him were not related to the Whitewater development. He served 13 months in prison.

Andre Agassi thinks John McEnroe and the Davis Cup are made for each other. ``At some point you've got to stop talking about it and do it,'' Agassi said. ``So I would like to see him try. I think he would have a heck of a shot.'' There have been hints the 41-year-old McEnroe might come back for doubles on the U.S. team. Agassi said Sunday he has watched McEnroe playing doubles, and ``he still is one of the best on the court.'' Chris Woodruff, a likely team member, said Saturday he would not be surprised to find McEnroe in the lineup. McEnroe quit as Davis Cup captain in November, four months after eventual champion Spain defeated the United States 5-0 in the semifinals. His brother, Patrick, succeeded him. Asked about selecting his brother for the team, Patrick said: ``It's certainly something I'm not going to rule out.'' ___ FED DRAW: The defending champion United States, Spain, Belgium and the Czech Republic received byes to the quarterfinals of the 2001 Fed Cup. The competition _ the women's equivalent of the Davis Cup _ will be played over three weeks _ in April, July and November. The four semifinals from last year advance to the quarters. The other 12 nations include regional qualifiers Argentina, Hungary and Japan. Completing the field are Slovakia, Russia, Germany, France, Switzerland, Croatia, Australia, Austria and Italy. The United States won the Fed Cup in 2000 for the second straight year. The team of Monica Seles, Lindsay Davenport, Jennifer Capriati and Lisa Raymond defeated Belgium in the semis and then swept Spain. The 2001 competition has yet to draw a major sponsor. ___ AUSSIE OPTION: Officials Down Under haven't given up hope of convincing Jelena Dokic to play for Australia in the April 28-29 Fed Cup opener against Austria. Dokic said on the eve of the Australian Open she wanted to be listed as a Yugoslavian from now on. Fed Cup coach Lesley Bowrey said she had spoken to Dokic and was sure the 17-year-old had not closed off the possibility of playing for Australia. International Tennis Federation rules dictate that a player swapping nationalities must sit out 32 months of international team tennis. Although playing as an individual at a tour event under the Yugoslavian flag was OK immediately under the ITF rules. Born in Belgrade, Dokic moved from Serbia to Australia with her family in 1994. She is upset over negative reports in the Australian media about her father. ___ DOUBLE VISION: When the tradition of wearing white clothes at Grand Slams ended, one supposed benefit was that it would be easier to distinguish players. Now things seem to be moving full circle, with rivals wearing the same clothing. Carlos Moya and Lleyton Hewitt were both wearing identical red shirts and blue shorts Saturday night. The following day, defending champion Lindsay Davenport and Kim Clijsters wore matching red shirts and white skirts. Moya was a fashion victim earlier in the week. He and first-round opponent Marcelo Rios wore identical white shirts and blue shorts for their match. ___ UP AND AT 'EM: After a third-round loss that spanned two days, Australia's Lleyton Hewitt was back at Melbourne Park first thing Sunday morning to support girlfriend Kim Clijsters. Hewitt, seeded No. 7 seed, lost in five sets to Carlos Moya in a match that started at 9:30 p.m. Saturday on center court at Melbourne Park and finished at 1:18 a.m. Sunday. Clijsters said she went to bed at 10 p.m. the previous night and didn't see the result of Hewitt's match. The 17-year-old Belgian, seeded 15th, lost 6-4, 6-0 to No. 2 Lindsay Davenport in a fourth-round match. ___ MONEY MATTERS: Lindsay Davenport, the defending Australian Open champion, said any debate over prize money should take into account how much the tournaments make off the players. Prize money in WTA events has increased from $38 million five years ago to $50 million this year. The jump is due to large sponsorship contracts and TV agreements, the WTA says. It does not include payouts at the four Grand Slams, which are run separately. ``It looks great when the winner gets lots of money,'' Davenport said. ``But you also have to look on how much the tournament makes off us and the television deals and all the money that the players generate.'' Davenport said players are generally happy with the money on the tour, although Russian star Yevgeny Kafelnikov said earlier in the week that the players are not getting their fair share.

A weeping Joseph Kabila, newly installed leader of Congo, mourned his slain father on Sunday as memorials for the president shifted to the crumbling capital where he was assassinated five days ago. Thousands of supporters grieved in the streets for Laurent Kabila, crying and waving palm fronds as a motorcade bearing his casket wound through the city. Many wailed and chanted ``Mzee, Mzee, Mzee'' _ a Swahili nickname for Kabila that means ``respected elder.'' ``We cry for our Mzee,'' said one mourner, Lean-Francois Ngola. ``He paid the price for his independence and dignity. He remains an example of respect for me.'' But others in this deeply divided Central African nation expressed little affection for the man who steered the country deeper into poverty and chaos. While state television trumpeted that ``all of Kinshasa is crying for Laurent Desire Kabila,'' police at a Simba Zikida marketplace were said to be ordering people to line the streets leading to the open-air Palace of the People, where Kabila will lie in state until his funeral Tuesday. ``They cannot force people to mourn. Even if it were my own father I would not accept it,'' said one shopper, who identified herself only as Honorine. ``But I'm afraid the soldiers will make trouble against the people.'' The unexpected outpouring of grief in a city Kabila distrusted and rarely stayed in may be explained by a saying in the majority Lingala language: ``First we cry for the dead, then we bury the dead. Then when it's finished, there will be big trouble.'' In Luanda, Angola, the presidents of Kabila's three foreign allies _ Angola, Namibia and Zimbabwe, met Sunday and pledged to keep their troops in Congo to support government forces. In a joint statement they urged all factions in the conflict to ``contain offensive military measures.'' Only Angola, however, gave public backing to the new president. Joseph Kabila, surrounded by soldiers from Congo and Angola, wept as his father's casket was unloaded from the presidential plane and marched across the tarmac to a waiting open-top trailer after its arrival from his home city of Lubumbashi, 1,000 miles to the southeast. The young leader, to be sworn in as president in the days after the funeral, walked behind the casket as it was carried past two rows of sobbing officials. Six military brass strained to heave the casket onto a trailer as another officer led the procession with a large portrait of the slain president. After taking power in a rebel march across this sweeping nation in May 1997, Kinshasa residents initially hailed Kabila as a hero. But those feelings were soon replaced by resentment as his corrupt grip on power began to resemble Mobutu Sese Seko, the dictator whose 30-year regime he toppled. There were some signs that Congolese authorities were taking no chances that Kabila's unpopularity would mar the memorial ceremony. A heavy military presence was staked out around the city, and armored vehicles were parked in front of the national television station. There was also tight security at the Palace of the People, where about 500 people sat on plastic chairs as the casket _ draped with a Congolese flag _ was placed in the middle of the large hall for viewing. Kabila's primary wife Maanya Sasi _ said to be one of at least three _ made a first-ever public appearance, sobbing hysterically as she was escorted inside the palace. Generals, cabinet officials and the wife sat on the dais facing the coffin, taking turns to pay their respects. Details of the assassination remain murky. Justice Minister Mwenze Kongolo said Saturday that Kabila was shot Tuesday by a bodyguard while he sat at his desk at the presidential palace. The assassin, now dead, approached the president as if to tell him something and shot him once behind the ear and then twice in the stomach, Kongolo said. It was still unclear Sunday who was behind the killing. Rebels backed by Rwanda and Uganda have been fighting Kabila's government since 1998. The shooting also came amid growing unrest within the Congolese army over unpaid wages. Zambian President Frederik Chiluba, a sometime peace negotiator between Congo's warring sides, said Sunday that the circumstances of Kabila's death ``have yet again cast a dark shadow on the rule of law in our continent.''

Abortion rights supporters are used to battle. But the ground has changed for the 28th anniversary of the landmark Roe v. Wade decision that legalized abortion. Abortion foes were energized by the changed political landscape and planned to be out in force Monday, marking the Supreme Court ruling with marches and protests. Bill Clinton, who helped the cause for keeping abortions legal, is gone from the White House, replaced by anti-abortion President Bush, who has nominated an even more staunch abortion opponent, John Ashcroft, as attorney general. ``Certainly we can't count on the White House now,'' said Patricia Ireland, president of the National Organization for Women. ``And we may not be able to count on the court even now _ but for sure if one more nominee gets through that's anything like the Ashcroft model.'' As a Republican senator from Missouri, Ashcroft proposed a constitutional amendment that would outlaw nearly all abortions, including in cases of rape and incest. He also opposes most forms of contraception. Republicans also control Congress now, and Bush could appoint one or more Supreme Court justices. Just one appointment could tip the balance _ with many decisions now being made on 5-4 votes. Any nominee, however, would have to be approved by a Senate divided 50-50 along party lines. ``It's like a shot across the bow _ a warning of things to come that could impact long past Bush's term, even if he's a two-term president,'' Ireland said. First lady Laura Bush broke from her husband's views last week and said she did not think the 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling should be overturned. But that gives little comfort to abortion rights supporters. Regardless of what his wife thinks, ``Bush has signaled that he is going to act on his personal convictions that a woman should not have the right to choose,'' said Gloria Feldt, president of Planned Parenthood Federation of America. Abortion opponents are more upbeat than they have been in years. They include Norma McCorvey, the ``Jane Roe'' of Roe v. Wade who now runs Dallas-based Roe No More Ministry, a speakers' referral service for the anti-abortion cause. ``I think the majority of pro-lifers are really looking forward to President Bush getting into office,'' McCorvey said. ``I think we all have the same dream: We'd like to see Roe v. Wade overturned.'' Abortion opponents think it's just a matter of time before abortion is outlawed again. ``I think pro-life people _ and I think that's a majority in the country _ certainly feel better now,'' said David O'Steen, executive director of National Right to Life. McCorvey, meanwhile, dismissed Ashcroft's statement at his Senate confirmation hearing that he would not try to make abortion illegal. ``I would like to think that John didn't really mean that,'' she said. But neither side is taking anything for granted. Monday's marches and other events by abortion opponents were being countered with efforts by abortion rights groups to mobilize their forces against Ashcroft with radio ads and Internet campaigns. Americans in general remain split on abortion. An exit poll in the presidential election found more voters favored keeping abortion legal, 55 percent to 42 percent. But only 20 percent thought it should be legal in all cases and 35 percent said it should be legal in most cases. Outlawing abortion after nearly three decades won't be easy. The fight isn't solely about Roe v. Wade anymore, said Laura Woliver, a political scientist and associate director of women's studies at the University of South Carolina. Abortion access can be eroded in other ways _ through regulation or by giving states more power, she noted. As attorney general, Ashcroft would decide how to enforce such laws as the Freedom of Access to Clinics Entrances law that seeks to ensure that patients and employees can come and go safely, Woliver said. Anti-abortion groups want Bush to repeal some Clinton executive orders. One eliminated the rule barring clinics from discussing abortion if they receive federal funds. Another ended the policy preventing foreign aid from funding abortions or educating people about them. Bush supports tightening standards for doctors administering the newly approved abortion pill RU-486, and has said he would sign legislation banning the late-term abortion procedure critics call ``partial-birth abortion'' that Clinton has vetoed. Bush also opposes federally funded research using stem cells from discarded human embryos.

In the most emphatic warning yet about the danger of global warming, a meeting of scientists from 99 nations issued a report Monday that sharply increased projected climate change blamed on air pollution and warned of drought and other disasters. The report, meant to spur stalled world talks on curbing greenhouse gas emissions, said global temperatures could rise by up to 10.5 degrees over the next century. ``This adds impetus for governments of the world to find ways to live up to their commitments ... to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases,'' said Robert T. Watson, chairman of the U.N.-affiliated Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which organized the Shanghai meeting. International talks ended in November without agreement on how to carry out a 1997 agreement by industrialized countries to cut greenhouse gas emissions to 5.2 percent below 1990 levels by 2010. Talks resume in May in Bonn, Germany. The Shanghai report, meant to be the most comprehensive study to date on global warming, says new evidence shows more clearly than ever that temperature increases are caused mostly by pollution, not by changes in the sun or other natural factors. ``The rate of climate change this century is expected to be greater than it has been in the past 10,000 years,'' Sir John T. Houghton, co-chairman of the Shanghai meeting and former head of Britain's weather agency, said at a news conference. The report is the one of the most authoritative pieces of evidence yet to support warnings that air pollution threatens to wreak environmental havoc by causing the atmosphere to trap more of the sun's heat. The findings were unanimously approved by the roughly 150 scientists and 80 members of environmental and industry groups attended the meeting. Rising temperatures could lead to drastic shifts in weather, scientists at the meeting said. They said drought could strike farming areas, while melting polar ice could raise sea levels, flooding densely populated coastal areas of China, Egypt and other countries. ``The poor in developing countries will be the most affected,'' said Watson, an American who is chief science adviser to the World Bank. In the most extreme projections, the report said, melting Antarctic ice could raise sea levels by up to 10 feet over the next 1,000 years. China is already suffering, said Ding Yihui, a co-chairman of the Shanghai meeting and former director of the China National Climate Center. Last year, the country suffered its worst drought in decades and grain production fell 10 percent. China is the second-biggest producer of greenhouse gases, after the United States. Beset by smog from its heavy reliance on coal, China has begun a massive effort to shift to natural gas and other cleaner fuels. The Shanghai conference was the start of a series of meetings under U.N. auspices to gather evidence for climate negotiators. Other gatherings will focus on the social and economic costs of global warming and how to reduce it. The series ends in April with the release of a huge report in Nairobi, Kenya. A key conflict in climate negotiations is a U.S.-led effort to reduce the impact of cuts. Washington wants to count carbon dioxide absorbed by forests and farmland against a country's reduction commitments. Some European governments oppose that. American cars, factories and power plants put out a quarter of the world's greenhouse gases, which also include nitrous oxide and methane. Other opponents of drastic cuts include oil companies and major coal producers such as Australia. ``The United States is way off meeting its targets,'' said Watson. ``A country like China has done more, in my opinion, than a country like the United States to move forward in economic development while remaining environmentally sensitive.''

Rescuers were frantically searching Monday for a construction worker trapped nine days under an earthquake-triggered mudslide after a dog smelled life under the mountain of dirt. Luis Alberto Alas, 39, was building a balcony on a luxury home in the Santa Tecla neighborhood of Las Colinas on Jan. 13 when a 7.6-magnitude earthquake buried the area under a mountain of dirt, killing more than 700 people. Alas' wife, Mercedes, had stood vigil over the spot where she believed her husband might be trapped since the quake, but searchers going over the area had found no trace of him. The search began anew late Sunday when Jimmy, a German Shepherd donated by the French government, indicated he smelled something under the ground where Mercedes Alas had told rescue crews to dig. ``We heard noises and it sounded like those noises could belong to a person,'' said Ivon Delsaut, a French volunteer involved in the new search. ``It felt as if somebody was punching the ground below us,'' added Salvadoran Red Cross rescuer Jesus Balcaceres. Crews dug all night Sunday _ but remained unsure if anyone was alive under the rubble. ``I will never lose hope that he is under there alive,'' Mercedes Alas said. ``This was a construction site where there were many large objects that could protect my husband from the dirt.'' The last person pulled alive from the debris was Sergio Moreno. The 22-year-old keyboard player was freed a day after the earthquake after spending 31 hours trapped in the bathroom of his Las Colinas home. He died two days later. As rescuers again dug into what was left of Las Colinas, those living in a nearby refugee camp wondered how they would put the pieces of their lives back together. ``We will stay here until they tell us it's time to go, then we will move to another camp,'' said Jose Luis Solorzano, 40, who worked as a cab driver until the quake leveled his three-room shack and flattened his taxi. ``It is very crowded here and it gets cold at night. But living on the street there are no donated clothes or tents and life is even more miserable.'' The quake's death toll stands at 710. The quake destroyed 141,000 Salvadoran homes and left approximately 750,000 people homeless. Three small aftershocks were recorded in El Salvador on Sunday, bringing the total number since last Saturday's quake to 1,927. No injuries or damage were reported in Sunday's aftershocks.

President George W. Bush said Monday that he would block U.S. financial aid to international family-planning organizations that spend some of their own money to make abortion and abortion counseling available. Word of his decision, which came as no surprise since he all but pledged well before his inauguration to impose such a barrier, initially came from the White House spokesman Monday morning. Bush's press secretary, Ari Fleischer, declined to confirm any final decision to reverse a position embraced by former President Bill Clinton. ``The president does not support using taxpayer funds to provide abortions,'' Fleischer said, adding that, ``Executive orders are possible at any time.'' Bush himself, speaking with reporters at the White House before meeting with Republican leaders from Capitol Hill, confirmed the decision several hours later, but he refused to say when he would issue the order. Asked by a reporter if he was going to reverse the Clinton administration's position on unrestricted family-planning aid, Bush replied: ``Yes, I am. Soon.'' On his first workday in the White House, Bush also issued a written statement on the 28th anniversary of the Supreme Court's ruling in Roe v. Wade, which established the right of a woman to choose abortion. ``The promises of our Declaration of Independence are not just for the strong, the independent or the healthy. They are for everyone, including unborn children,'' the statement said. ``We share a great goal, to work toward a day when every child is welcomed in life and protected in law ... to build a culture of life, affirming that every person at every stage and season of life, is created equal in God's image.'' Kate Michelman, the president of the National Abortion and Reproduction Rights Action League or NARAL, called Bush's decision part of an attack on women's reproductive rights, citing also his nomination of abortion opponents to major Cabinet posts _ like former Sen. John Ashcroft for attorney general and Gov. Tommy Thompson of Wisconsin as secretary of health and human services. Bush had already indicated his intent to reverse the Clinton decision on giving financial aid to international family-planning organizations. In an interview a week before taking office, he said that ``organizations that promote abortions are organizations I don't want to support.'' In that interview, he was explicit in his intention to undo many presidential executive orders that were in place under the Clinton administration. It was surely no coincidence that reports of Bush's decision coincided with the anniversary of the Supreme Court's Roe v. Wade decision. There were scattered anti-abortion protests Monday near the Supreme Court, as there are every year on the anniversary of the ruling. The financial aid curbs that Bush was said to be ready to impose _ more specifically, to reimpose _ are sometimes known as the Mexico City limitations, since it was during a 1984 family-planning conference there that President Ronald Reagan announced the U.S. policy. The Reagan-imposed limits remained in place under Reagan's successor, President George Herbert Walker Bush, but were reversed at the beginning of Clinton's first term, in 1993. But the issue of abortion, so freighted with personal beliefs and emotional reactions, has also been part of pragmatic and not entirely logical political calculations. Under a compromise reached in October to avoid a confrontation between congressional Republicans and Clinton, Congress allocated $425 million for such family planning activities _ but said it could not be spent until Feb. 15. That arrangement effectively cleared the way for the younger Bush to return to the Reagan policy. What practical effect the Mexico City limitations, or their absence, actually has in other countries is not entirely clear. What is abundantly clear, however, is that abortion will endure as a political issue no matter what courts and lawmakers decide.

which brings us to nbc news "in depth" tonight and one of the ex-president's last official acts. pardons for 140 people, including one very controversial man who has been on the run from the law for almost two decades and whose ex-wife is a major contributor to the democratic party and the clintons. our "in depth" report from nbc's pete williams. on the very day the white house hands out the summary of president clinton's very last official pardons, one man on that list is also on another, a u.s. government internet site for international fugitives. he's marc rich, on the lam for 17 years, now a multimillionaire living in switzerland, enjoying the skiing and avoiding u.s. charges of tax evasion and trading with the enemy. his pardon, with barely two hours left in the clinton presidency, is sparking outrage from people familiar with the case, including new york mayor rudolph giuliani, who brought the charges against rich in 1983. he ran away. it was, at the time, the largest tax evasion case in the history of the united states. legal experts say nearly all presidential pardons go to people who have served time for their crimes. that's true for most of the 456 pardons during the clinton administration, an eight-year total only slightly higher than the number granted by ronald reagan, the last two-term president. but a former prosecutor on the case says rich, as a fugitive, is especially undeserving. the principle of giving a pardon to somebody who is basically stuck their tongue out at the system and such an important case as this one was because it drew so much attention, even now it is drawing attention, i just don't understand it. rich was accused of a scam to avoid oil price controls and evade nearly $50 million in federal taxes. and prosecutors said he illegally bought oil from iran while it was under a u.s. trade embargo for holding americans there hostage. his lawyers say it wasn't rich that did the trading, it was his swiss-based company, not subject to u.s. law. an argument he himself made to nbc news in 1993. was there a crime, and i'm saying i don't think so. on sunday, mr. clinton said the case for pardoning rich was pleaded personally by jack quinn, a former counsel in the clinton white house. i spent a lot of personal time talking -- because it's an unusual case, but quinn made a strong case and i was convince head was right on the merits. opponents of the pardon say they think contributions by rich's ex-wife, denise, who has given nearly $1 million to democratic causes during the clinton era, were also a factor. though rich's lawyers deny that. lawyers involved in the case today say clinton never contacted the justice department for its views on pardoning rich. that makes this pardon, says a former justice department lawyer, a big departure from the usual practice. for probably about 135 years the president has felt that it serves him best to have a filter and a recommendation from the attorney general. but now, with a presidential pardon, marc rich is free to come back to the u.s. no longer facing trial in one of the biggest tax fraud cases ever. pete williams, nbc news, washington. this footnote, in addition to those 140 pardons, president clinton also commuted the sentences of 36 people on his last day in office.

and in the south pacific tonight, the u.s. coast guard is part of a team fighting to contain an oil spill threatening the galapagos islands, one of the world's most fragile ecosystems. it all started last week when an oil tanker went aground near ecuador. nbc's robert hager has the latest tonight. a race against time. 160,000 gallons of diesel and heavy oil, already soiling the pristine waters and shoreline, here where the 19th century naturalist charles darwin forged his theory of evolution, already affecting sea lions and pelicans in this, the home of many species found nowhere else on earth. an emergency team from the u.s. coast guard airlifted in as the tanker lists, dangerously. the captain -- at least half of the cargo tanks are already leaking. most of them have already leaked most of their oil. the coast guard will try to pump the ship's remaining oil into a barge, but at any time the tanker could split in two. as for what's already spilled -- the bottom line is once oil gets out of a ship, it is virtually impossible to remove it or contain it on the open ocean. the stricken tanker is here at the island of san cristobal. the island of santa fe, a haven for sea lions is here, the island of santa cruz, a pelican and bird refuge here, and the oil is headed this way. this is a place where one goes and feels that you can't even sense the presence of humans. and to have something like this happen, that may forever transform the landscape is just crushing. tonight here, where darwin first argued nature selects by survival of the fittest, a threat to survive by an unnatural disaster darwin couldn't have imagined.

Welcome back to VOA News Now. I am Tony Riggs. In one of his first moves in office President Bush has signed an Executive order blocking US funds to International Family Planning groups that offer abortion and counseling. The action came as thousands of abortion opponents marched in Washington on the 28th anniversary of the US Supreme Court decision legalizing the procedure. Correspondent Deborah Tate reports from the White House. In his executive order Mr. Bush says it his conviction that taxpayer funds should not be used to pay for abortions or advocate or actively promote them. His order restores the ban on Federal funds to overseas family planning groups that perform abortion services that was put in place in 1984 by Republican President Reagan. That policy named for the city where Mr. Reagan issued the ban, Mexico City, was continued by Mr. Bush's father in 1989 but it was overturned in 1993 by President Clinton, a Democrat. Mr. Bush's announcement Monday was immediately applauded by abortion opponents, but abortion supporters see the move as the first step by the administration toward overturning the 1973 Supreme Court decision known as Ro v Vaid that legalized abortion. While Mr. Bush has said he does not believe the country is ready for a constitutional amendment banning abortion, he also has indicated he would not rule out using the Justice Department to challenge the High Court ruling if the opportunity arose. Reporters asked White House spokesman Arie Fleischer why the President, who promised to unite the country after last year's close and bitterly fought election, chose a divisive issue to highlight on his first day of business in the White House. Mr. Fleischer responded Mr. Bush was making good on a campaign pledge that he said many Americans and even some Democrats supported. Earlier Monday Mr. Bush released a statement of support to anti-abortion marchers marking the anniversary of Ro v Vaid . It was read at the rally by Republican Congressman Chris Miff of New Jersey, an abortion opponent. We share a great goal to work toward a day when every child is welcomed in life and protected in law. President Bush 'course on the right, we know this will not come easily or all at once. But the goal leads us onward to build a culture of life affirming that every person at every stage and season of life is created equal in God's image. Promising to promote what he calls a culture of life, Mr. Bush also has vowed to sign legislation that would ban late term partial birth abortions, legislation that his predecessor Mr. Clinton twice vetoed.

The American duo Venus and Serena have both advanced to the Quarter Finals of the Australian Open tennis tournament in Melbourne after chalking up victories on Monday. The sixth seeded Serena was a 6-2,6-2 winner over unseeded Czech Dayeb Bidanora and will face top seed Martina Hingis of Switzerland in the round of eight. Hingis had an easy time advancing. She beat overcome some bouts of wildness in the second set before overcoming Frenchwoman Emily Moresmo 6-2, 3-6, 6-3, the American says she was not playing her best. I tried to everything that my dad has told me and it was going to work out today. and hit much better than a 150 kilometers at which to put it in. At the end I for a gold and got lucky. Williams will face tenth seeded Amanda Coetzer in the quarter finals after the South African moved past Paula Juarez of Argentina 6-1,6-4. In the men's draw 1999 champion and fifth seed Yevgenic Kafelnikov of Russia advanced to the final eight with a straight sets win over Andreas Winsegerera of Sweden. He will battle number fifteen Arnold Clement of France who ended the tournament for Greg Ruzedzki of Britain in three sets. Ruzedzki says Clement deserved the win but he is not disappointed. It's all credit to him, he was, he played as well as I've ever seen him play. And I thought I played pretty well . It's been a great start for me to the Australian Open and a great start for the year. So I have nothing to be negative about, it's all positive. Meanwhile unseeded Carlos Moya of Spain continued his comeback with a straight sets win over Jimen Wayner Schutner, Moya will play sixteen seeded Sebastian Gostran of France who upset number four Magnus Norman of Sweden in four sets.

Thank you Tony and good day. In his first major policy action President George W Bush has signed an executive order blocking US funds to International Family Planning groups that offer abortions and counseling. In signing the order Monday Mr. Bush said he does not believe US taxpayer dollars should go to such groups. Former Presidents Reagan and Bush had imposed the restrictions in the 1980s but President Clinton overturned them. Mr. Bush's order came on the day when thousands of anti-abortion activists held their annual March for Life rally here in Washington marking the 28th anniversary of Ro versus Vaid. That's the 1973 Supreme Court decision that legalized abortion in the United States. This is a march spokeswoman Nellie Gray. Stopping abortion is the responsibility of every elected and appointed official in Federal State and local governments throughout our country. Kate Michaelman who leads the National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League, a pro-abortion group, says Mr. Bush's order is just the first step. He is paving the way for a Supreme Court nomination that will clearly overturn Ro v Vaid, judicial nominations that will allow more restrictions at the State level

Jubilant over the prospect of a friend in the White House changing abortion policy, opponents of legalized abortion rallied in the nation's capital Monday on the 28th anniversary of Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court decision that declared a constitutional right to abortion. They cheered the departure of President Clinton, and were warmly greeted _ in words and action _ by President Bush. ``We share a great goal: to work toward a day when every child is welcomed in life and protected in law,'' Bush declared in a statement read by Rep. Chris Smith of New Jersey, to a sprawling crowd beneath the Washington Monument. ``We know that this will not come easily or all at once, but the goal leads us onward, to build a culture of life.'' In a move fraught with symbolism, Bush announced that he would reimpose a ban on federal aid to international organizations that perform or ``actively promote abortion as a method of family planning.'' He was thus reversing an action taken by Clinton exactly eight years before, also on the anniversary of Roe v. Wade, underscoring the fact that in the deeply polarized struggle over abortion, one side had won, the other lost. Family planning and reproductive rights organizations denounced it as a return to ``the international gag rule'' of the Bush and Reagan eras, an attempt to deny fundamental freedoms of speech and political action to those providing health care abroad. It is ``a restriction that would be unconstitutional if imposed here in the U.S.,'' in the words of Kate Michelman, president of the National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League. But the crowd at the ``March for Life,'' an annual ritual here, roared in approval when Sen. Sam Brownback, R-Kan., announced the White House move. ``That's real action,'' Brownback said. For all the good spirit in the anti-abortion ranks, there were signs of concern after 10 days of conflicting signals from the Bush team. Some here were clearly rankled by former Sen. John Ashcroft's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week that Roe v. Wade was ``settled law'' and that the administration would thus not seek opportunities to challenge it. The Roe decision will never be ``settled law'' in America because it is so profoundly wrong, declared a leader of the march, Nellie Gray. She also served notice that abortion opponents would not be satisfied with incremental victories. ``What we're saying to all Washington officialdom is this _ it's on your watch now,'' Gray said. ``Tax cuts are important, but they're not the top priority.'' The top priority must be the abortion issue, she argued. First lady Laura Bush also clearly caused some concern when she declared, last week, that she did not believe the Roe v. Wade decision should be overturned. Congressman Smith, a longtime abortion foe, said in an interview that it `'was a bit of a surprise'' but that he was confident in Bush's ``faithfulness'' to his pro-life convictions. Bush himself, in an interview Monday with NBC, said, ``I've always said that Roe versus Wade was a judicial reach.'' But so far, Bush seems to be riding a wave of expectations and relief, judging from Monday's events. One speaker after another celebrated the departure of Clinton, a close ally of the abortion rights movement. ``The long eight years is over,'' declared former Rep. Robert Dornan. ``We have a man of deep faith in the White House, and we will have a man of deep faith as the nation's top cop.'' Rep. Steve Chabot, R-Ohio, declared, ``Boy, it sounds good to say `former President Clinton.''' Organizers said they were delighted by the size of the crowd this year, but the U.S. Park police no longer provide crowd estimates for marches and demonstrations. The banners and signs suggested it was a heavily Catholic crowd, with buses from Allentown, Pa., St. Louis and points beyond and between. And there was an array of Catholic church leaders on the stage. As he marched up the muddy Washington Mall, Bishop William Curlin of Charlotte, N.C., said, ``It will take time to change hearts.'' But Curlin added of Bush, ``He gives us hope. That's what's important today. You felt under the former administration that there was no hope as far as the sanctity of life issue.'' Managing those expectations, now that Bush is no longer candidate but president, may be the challenge. During the campaign, Bush embraced a Republican platform that called for a ban on abortions, which won him the loyalty of the party's strong anti-abortion base. But he rarely campaigned on the issue, and when pressed said he thought such a ban was a distant goal. But the abortion opponents now clearly expect quick action on issues like a review of the abortion pill RU-486 and a ban on ``partial birth'' abortion. ``As long as Roe versus Wade is the law of the land, January 22nd will live in infamy,'' Wanda Franz, president of the National Right to Life Committee, said Monday. ``It is no exaggeration to say that the court's action in Roe versus Wade prepared the path for what is now rightfully called the `culture of death.' It is also fair to say that Roe versus Wade and the subsequent decisions based on and extending Roe versus Wade are the most radical decisions in the history of the Supreme Court.''

Carrying signs that read ``Defend Life'' and ``Stop Abortion Now,'' thousands marched to the Supreme Court on Monday in an annual rite of protest against Roe v. Wade, the decision that legalized abortion nationwide 28 years ago. But there was something different this year: President Bush, an abortion opponent sworn in two days before the ``March for Life,'' welcomed and encouraged the protesters. ``Two days ago, Americans gathered on the Washington Mall to celebrate our nation's ideals. Today, you are gathered to remind our country that one of those ideals is the infinite value of every life,'' Bush said in a message read by Rep. Christopher Smith, R-N.J., an outspoken abortion foe. Abortion opponents hope to take advantage of the new political landscape to push a Republican-controlled Congress and White House they expect will be more sympathetic to overturning Roe v. Wade. Bush told the crowd he appreciated their efforts. ``We share a great goal: to work toward a day when every child is welcomed in life and protected in law,'' his message said. ``We know this will not come easily, or all at once. But the goal leads us onward: to build a culture of life, affirming that every person, at every stage and season of life, is created equally in God's image.'' Former President Clinton, a Democrat, supported abortion rights and thwarted opponents' attempts to curb access to the procedure. He never addressed the gathering, but two of his Republican predecessors, George Bush and Ronald Reagan, generally sent greetings. The protesters, meeting for a rally on the Ellipse near the White House, were led in prayer by Sen. Sam Brownback, R-Kan., before marching to the Supreme Court. ``Boy it feels good to say 'former President Clinton,''' said Rep. Steve Chabot, R-Ohio, adding that the country now has a president who believes ``human life is sacred.'' Twice during his presidency, Clinton vetoed legislation to outlaw a late-term procedure described as partial-birth abortion by its critics. Chabot said the measure would be reintroduced. ``He will sign it, not veto it,'' he said of Bush. Abortion-rights advocates criticized the march. ``They don't represent the majority of people in this country who are pro-choice and pro-family planning and who voted for the pro-choice candidate,'' said Kate Michelman, president of the National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League. Despite some setbacks, abortion foes seem energized and expect Bush to move quickly to overturn several Clinton administration policies. Bush confirmed Monday that he will reverse Clinton's decision to restore federal funding for international family planning groups that offer abortion counseling. Another candidate for reversal is government approval of the RU-486 abortion pill. Anti-abortion advocates also want a ban on federal funding for research involving fetal tissue or the destruction of human embryos, including stem cell research. Two narrow Supreme Court rulings disappointed anti-abortion advocates last year. Voting 5-4, the justices struck down Nebraska's partial-birth abortion law. The court, by 6-3, also gave states greater authority to restrict anti-abortion demonstrators outside clinics. Last week, former Missouri Sen. John Ashcroft, Bush's choice for attorney general, surprised some during his confirmation hearings by pledging to enforce laws guaranteeing a woman's right to abortion. As a senator, Ashcroft had proposed a constitutional amendment to outlaw nearly all abortions, including those performed in cases of rape and incest. He also opposes most forms of contraception. Bush has said the country isn't ready for a constitutional amendment banning abortion. In interviews last week, he did not rule out having the Justice Department challenge Roe v. Wade if the opportunity arose. He also called the decision a ``judicial reach.''

More than 160,000 gallons of fuel that spilled from a stricken tanker pose a threat to creatures great and small _ from birds to iguanas to sea lions _ off this fragile natural treasure where Charles Darwin forged his theory of evolution. The spill began last week, but by Monday some 20,000 gallons of fuel remained inside the disabled tanker. A U.S. team sent to help was working to transfer fuel pouring through the ruptured hull to empty storage tanks still intact within the ship. ``The bottom line is once oil gets out of a ship it's virtually impossible to remove it or contain it on the ocean,'' Coast Guard Capt. Edwin Stanton said. The Ecuadorean tanker Jessica, carrying 243,000 gallons of diesel, ran aground Jan. 16 in pounding surf off San Cristobal Island, the easternmost island in the Galapagos archipelago. The ship started leaking fuel Friday as it tilted sharply. Ecuadorean Environment Minister Rodolfo Rendon told The Associated Press that about 60,000 gallons were recovered from the damaged tanker, but not before more than 160,000 gallons seeped through fissures in the hull. Experts were monitoring slicks carried by strong currents to the south and _ more alarmingly _ west toward the bulk of islands in the volcanic Galapagos chain, an ecosystem populated by animal and plant species found nowhere else in the world. Darwin, the 19th-century naturalist, developed his theory of evolution by studying wildlife on these islands in the Pacific Ocean, 600 miles off Ecuador's coast. The islands, a part of Ecuador's territory since 1832, were formed 4 million to 5 million years ago by underwater volcanos. Most are arid and rocky, dotted more by cactuses than lush vegetation. Galapagos National Park spokesman Fabian Oviedo said Monday that dispersants and absorbents were being used to lessen the impact of the diesel, but that the fuel had already reached Santa Fe Island, 37 miles west of San Cristobal. ``The part of Santa Fe most affected is the coastal zone of El Miedo, populated by iguanas, sea lions and birds, such as the blue-footed booby,'' he said. ``Four sea lions stained with diesel have been spotted, as well as boobies and 30 pelicans.'' He said most of the birds ``had been captured and were undergoing a process of cleaning with special detergents.'' He added that monitoring flights were being conducted over Santa Cruz, the next major island over in the chain. But Carlos Valle, coordinator of the World Wildlife Fund's Galapagos program in Ecuador, said the damage could be grave for the hundreds of sea lions and thousands of iguanas that populate Santa Fe. ``It is very difficult to move them because they are very territorial,'' he said. ``The most vulnerable animals are the blue-footed boobies, masked boobies and frigate birds whose feeding zone is in the area of the spill.'' He said some colonies of marine turtles could be threatened. But species in danger of extinction, such as the miniature Galapagos penguin and flightless cormorant, are not in danger because they live in the far western reaches of the archipelago. The giant land tortoises, which can reach 550 pounds and for which the Galapagos are named, were not in danger because they live in the higher elevations of the islands. Galapagos National Park biologist Mauricio Velasquez has said one long-term threat is that the fuel will sink to the ocean floor, destroying algae that is vital to the food chain, threatening marine iguanas, sharks, birds that feed off fish and other species. The 11-member U.S. team, which arrived late Sunday with 25 tons of cargo and equipment, expects to carry out its job within two or three days, Stanton told The Associated Press. But he said the transfer of fuel mixed with sea water inside the ruptured tanks could ``provoke great tension in the general structure'' of the 28-year-old tanker. ``It is an old vessel and it has grave structural damage,'' he said. ``The boat is being moved by strong waves and could break apart at any moment.'' Police on San Cristobal said no charges had been filed against the ship's captain, Tarquino Arevalo, or against his company, Acotramar. But Ecuadorean President Gustavo Noboa demanded a ``detailed report'' on the cause of the accident. Capt. Ramiro Morejon, chief of Control and Marine Monitoring for the Galapagos park, said the spill could have been avoided. ``Looking at the navigation chart, in which a signal buoy was mistaken for a lighthouse, the accident was definitely caused by human error,'' he said.

Jennifer Capriati's latest win made her feel like a kid again. With a 5-7, 6-4, 6-3 victory Tuesday over Monica Seles at the Australian Open, Capriati became a Grand Slam semifinalist for only the second time since 1991, when she was 15. ``It's one of the best matches I've played,'' said Capriati, now 24. ``It kind of reminded me of the old days.'' She lost a dramatic first set and fell behind in the second, then rallied as Seles tired. Seles, seeded fourth, fell to 37-2 at the Australian Open. She won the title in 1991-93 and 1996, and her only other loss was to Martina Hingis in the 1999 semifinals. Capriati reached the Australian Open semifinals last year before losing to eventual champion Lindsay Davenport. Her next opponent will be the winner of the match Tuesday night between the No. 2 Davenport and No. 8 Anna Kournikova. ``I think I'll be watching that match,'' said Capriati, who is seeded 12th. The quarterfinals will be completed Wednesday. The top-seeded Hingis will play No. 6 Serena Williams, and No. 3 Venus Williams will take on No. 10 Amanda Coetzer. Missing from the final eight were the four top-seeded men _ only the third time that's happened in a Grand Slam tournament since the Open era began in 1968. No. 4 Magnus Norman was eliminated in the last fourth-round match by No. 16 Sebastien Grosjean 7-6 (7), 6-3, 0-6, 6-4. No. 1 Gustavo Kuerten, No. 2 Marat Safin and No. 3 Pete Sampras lost earlier. In Wednesday's matches, Grosjean plays unseeded Carlos Moya, and No. 5 Yevgeny Kafelnikov faces No. 15 Arnaud Clement. Capriati, who has endured many wrenching postmatch news conferences at Grand Slam tournaments, this time was beaming. Even the potentially touchy subject of her recent weight loss couldn't stop her from smiling, and she confirmed that her conditioning is much improved. ``It's a lot of hard work that has paid off,'' she said. ``I'm just thrilled.'' Capriati left the women's tour for several years in the mid-1990s because of drug and personal problems. Her father, Stefano, began coaching her last year, and she said her improved results are a reflection of her contentment off the court. ``The tennis sort of follows that,'' she said. ``I'm just happy playing tennis and feel free and relaxed with it.'' Capriati had lost all five previous Grand Slam meetings against Seles. The rivalry dates to the 1990 French Open, when Capriati was 14. ``Now I'm older and a lot stronger and physically fit, so maybe I can get back those hard balls she hits better now,'' Capriati said. She kept Seles on the move with deep groundstrokes to both corners, and in the second set the tactic began to take a toll. Seles tired despite the mild weather, and after she took a 4-2 lead in the second set, Capriati won eight consecutive games. Seles finally closed out the first set after Capriati had saved seven set points, all in the tense final game. It lasted 22 points, went to deuce eight times and included two rallies of more than 20 shots. Seles appeared on the verge of victory in the second set when Capriati double-faulted to fall behind 4-2, threw her racket in anger and drew a warning from the chair umpire. ``I just wanted to cut down on my errors and execute my shots better, and that's what I did,'' Capriati said. She broke right back, evened the set at 4-4 with her third ace and then began to dominate the baseline rallies. When she closed out the 1-hour, 55-minute win, she grinned, blew kisses to the center-court crowd and said ``I love you'' to a TV camera _ a message for her mother and brother back home in Florida.

A man claiming to be a supporter of Saddam Hussein hijacked a Yemeni plane carrying the U.S. ambassador and 90 other passengers Tuesday and diverted it to nearby Djibouti, authorities said. The man was overpowered by crew and everybody aboard was reportedly safe. Ambassador Barbara Bodine and the other passengers safely left the plane using its inflatable emergency exit chute after the hijacker was subdued, said acting U.S. Embassy spokesman Donna Visocan, contacted in the Yemeni capital of San`a. Visocan said the embassy had no immediate information on the fate of the hijacker, his motives or demands. But she said officials heard he had been unaware the passengers included U.S. diplomats. She said Bodine, who was accompanied by other embassy staff, later took off on a flight back to San`a. Bodine had been flying to the city of Taiz for meetings with Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh, who has been in the area inspecting government projects. It was not clear whether Bodine's meeting with Saleh would be rescheduled. But Gen. Tommy Franks, the Florida-based commander of the U.S. Central Command, was already in Taiz to meet with Saleh, Visocan said. The meeting apparently was called to address the terrorist attack on the USS Cole as it sat in a Yemeni harbor and other security matters. Yemeni airport officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the hijacker used the aircraft's radio to speak to them about 15 minutes into the half-hour flight, saying he would blow up the Boeing 727 if it were not diverted to Djibouti, a Horn of Africa country just across the Gulf of Aden from Yemen. The officials said the man spoke with an Iraqi accent and that they believed he was armed with a grenade and a pistol. The hijacker also told airport officials he was a supporter of the Iraqi president and claimed Iraq had won the 1991 Persian Gulf War _ in which U.S.-led international coalition forced Saddam to reverse his 1990 invasion of Kuwait. The Yemeni Interior Ministry said the hijacker was an Iraqi who wanted to go to Iraq. Airport officials said there were 91 passengers, including foreign diplomats, aboard the Yemenia flight. They did not say how many crew members were aboard. The Saudi Arabian carrier Saudia has a 49 percent stake in Yemenia, the state carrier formed in 1996 with the merger of Yemenia Airlines of the former North Yemen and Al-Yemda of once-Marxist South Yemen. The unified Yemeni government owns 51 percent of the airline. In 1994, a young Yemeni man holding a hand grenade stormed the cockpit of an Al-Yemda jetliner on a domestic flight and demanded to be flown to Saudi Arabia. The man was overpowered and the plane landed safely in San`a. A Libyan diplomat and a Yemeni tried to hijack an Egyptian airliner en route from San`a to Tunisia in December 1998, demanding that the plane be flown to Libya in a violation of U.N. sanctions then. The plane, however, landed in Tunisia. Airport security officials said they were investigating the latest hijacking, questioning all staff on duty when the plane took off. Yemen is know for its lawlessness. Many Yemenis carry guns, and kidnappings and other challenges by tribesmen to central authority are common. Bodine, who served as No. 2 at the U.S. Embassy in Kuwait during the Gulf War, has had a high profile since terrorists attacked the USS Cole warship as it refueled in Yemen's southern port of Aden. After the Oct. 12 bombing that killed 17 U.S. sailors, Bodine oversaw logistics for U.S. investigators who streamed into the dusty harbor town and has returned several times to meet with investigators. Bodine also worked on the negotiating team that eventually found a way for the Americans to participate actively in the probe despite Yemeni sovereignty concerns. A decade ago, the 52-year-old St. Louis native was one of the last foreign diplomats to remain in Kuwait after Saddam ordered them out.

a shift of winds is pushing an oil spill away from the galapagos islands and into the open sea. but the cleanup is far from over, as robert moore reports. ecuador's declaration of a state of emergencies around the galapagos islands is a sign of how serious the oil spil is now judged. it may not be a large tanker by international standards, but this is a uniquely fragile and precious marine environment. experts examining the wreck are still concentrating on transferring to safe storage the oil and fuel that remains onboard. and the u.s. coast guard are helping in this operation. but ecuador's environment minister describes the ship's condition as critical with gallons of oil still on the ship. some of that fuel will evaporate but the currents are moving the spill toward a large number of other island in the chain. worsening weather could also be a factor in the coming days. the smells are getting worse out there. we hear there is a big -- there's a gale up north that's going to create a big swell by wednesday. the galapagosiles lie 600 miles off ecuador a pacific coast. populate bade animal and plant species found nowhere else. it was amid this teaming world of land and marine animals that charles darwin developed his theories of evolution. the reality of an oil spill here has led to environmental organizations calling for greater control of shipping in the area. authorities on the island say the ship rung aground was a simple navigational error. robert moore, itn.

A week after he was gunned down here, this capital city held a state funeral Tuesday for President Laurent Kabila, who struggled for three decades to depose a dictator but who held on to power for just over three years. In a ceremony rich with symbolism that evoked this war-ravaged country's troubled past and present, Kabila was buried in a mausoleum in front of the old parliament building, the Palace of the Nation. A statue of a horse-riding Leopold II _ the Belgian king who made Congo his own territory in 1885 and set off Europe's scramble for African colonies _ once stood at the site, where the country's independence was also granted in a ceremony in 1960. Earlier in the day, a Mass was held at the People's Palace, with Kabila's son and successor, Joseph Kabila, sitting sandwiched between the presidents of Angola and Zimbabwe, the two countries that have backed the government in its war against rebels backed by Uganda and Rwanda. Even as doubts remain about who is really in control in Kinshasa, Zimbabwean soldiers kept guard during the funeral, walking through the Chinese-built People's Palace with their Kalashnikovs. At the funeral, Joseph Kabila, dressed in a black suit, bowed once before his father's coffin. The son, who is in his early 30s, did not speak. The government says that the president was shot three times last Tuesday by a bodyguard while meeting an aide inside his office. The government said that Kabila was taken, alive, to a hospital here and then airlifted to Zimbabwe, where he died at 10 a.m. Thursday. His age was given as 59, but he was believed to be older. Several government officials gave a different version of his death. They said that it is now widely known that Kabila died on Tuesday and that the government delayed the death announcement to prepare the ascension of his son to the presidency. ``He died on the spot,'' a high-ranking military official, who has worked with Joseph Kabila for several years, said of the father. The government has announced only that the bodyguard, Rashidi Kasereka, was immediately killed, and that an investigation was being conducted to determine the people behind him. The military official said that the investigation had yet to reveal who was behind the assassination. But he said that a dozen bodyguards in the presidential palace _ displeased because they believed they had been mistreated _ had been arrested for taking part in the assassination plot. Like Kasereka, all the bodyguards had been recruited as children by Kabila in eastern Congo to fight in the rebellion that ousted the longtime dictator, Mobutu Sese Seko, in 1997, the military official said. He added that Kasereka himself had joined Kabila after losing both his parents and a brother. ``We asked them why they did it,'' the military official said. ``They all answered, `Because of suffering.''' (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) The military official, as well as a high-ranking politician, said that the soldiers were angry because they had not been paid or fed. Kabila apparently brushed away advice to treat the soldiers assigned to the presidential palace better. On one occasion, the politician said, the soldiers physically stopped Kabila's wife from leaving the palace. ``They were hungry, so the wife simply opened the henhouse and gave them the chickens inside,'' the politician said. ``But when her husband returned, he was very angry that the henhouse was empty.'' The politician added: ``Kabila was killed in the most stupid manner. The soldiers were very unhappy. You often saw them begging for food or cigarettes just outside the presidential palace. Mobutu did not pay all his soldiers, but he always made sure that the soldiers inside the presidential palace were always paid on time and were always well fed.'' (END OPTIONAL TRIM) Joseph Kabila, who was named president last week, is expected to be sworn in to his new position on Wednesday. Many Congolese here are unhappy over the choice because they perceive him as an outsider _ whose mother is possibly Tutsi, who grew up in Tanzania and eastern Congo, and who is fluent in English and Swahili, but not French or the languages of western Congo. Many Congolese here believe that Joseph Kabila has yet to address the nation because of his language difficulties. When Joseph Kabila followed his father to Kinshasa in 1997, he spoke broken French with an English accent but has greatly improved since then, the military official said. ``Now when he speaks to a small group of people, he speaks in French,'' the official said. ``But when he speaks to a group of more than 10 or 12, he prefers speaking in Swahili and having his comments translated into French. And when he writes notes to himself, he writes in English. He cannot write in French.'' On Kinshasa's streets, especially in the city center where the funeral and burial took place, Zimbabwean and Angolan soldiers outnumbered Congolese soldiers. Ordinary French-speaking Congolese, who found many streets blocked, could not even plead their cases to the Portuguese-speaking Angolans or the English-speaking Zimbabweans. But the soldiers did little to prevent bands of youths carrying sticks and stones from roaming the streets and attacking foreigners. A group hurled stones at two buses carrying Belgian officials to the funeral. ``Belgians, killers!'' the youths yelled. ``Diamond thieves!'' The Belgians, who massacred millions of Congolese during colonial rule, also had the nationalist leader Patrice Lumumba assassinated after independence. To this day, many of Congo's diamonds, like the diamonds from other war-torn African countries, are believed to be smuggled out of Congo and into Antwerp, Belgium, the world's diamond capital.

State and federal officers followed hundreds of leads Tuesday for two escaped Texas prison inmates following a raid on a trailer park that netted the peaceful capture of four others and an arsenal of guns. A trooper was killed in a traffic accident Tuesday while following up one of those leads. The seventh of the men who broke out of a maximum security prison nearly six weeks ago killed himself in a motor home that had been surrounded by authorities Monday in this foothills community about 50 miles southwest of Denver. Authorities said they had no definite word on the location of the missing inmates, Patrick Murphy Jr., 39, convicted of rape, and armed robber Donald Newbury, 38. They may have been in Woodland Park as recently as Sunday and may have left to get more money. ``We frankly don't know where they are,'' Mark Mershon, the top FBI agent in Denver, said early Tuesday. ``We have law-enforcement agencies not only throughout the state of Colorado but all over the country looking for these individuals.'' ``We're covering hundreds of leads,'' he told KUSA-TV in Denver. The head of the Texas prison system was more optimistic. ``We're in much, much better position and shape now than where we were December 13th. We do have a trail now. We do have leads that we can follow up and we're not that far behind them,'' Mac Stringfellow, chairman of the Texas Board of Criminal Justice, said at a news conference in Austin, Texas. A Colorado State Patrol trooper was killed Tuesday while pursuing what turned out to be an inaccurate tip about a van believed used by the missing men. Authorities said the trooper lost control of his car and slammed into a parked truck on Interstate 70. The van he was following later turned up at the Keystone ski resort full of construction workers. Police in Texas raided a house in El Paso on Monday afternoon after a tip that the two were inside, but there was no trace of the men. Inside the motor home, officers found a suicide note, $5,000 in cash and 37 firearms, including 13 of the 14 weapons missing from the Texas prison, said Rich Marianos of the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. The other weapons were all traced to a sporting goods store robbed shortly after the escape, he said. Some of the weapons had been altered, with shotgun barrels sawed off and serial numbers scraped off. He would not say if the inmate who killed himself wrote the suicide note and would not detail the contents. The four in custody were expected to appear Tuesday before a federal magistrate in nearby Divide. The breakthrough that sent authorities to the Coachlight motel and RV park in Colorado came from tips from residents after the TV show ``America's Most Wanted'' aired Saturday. Authorities believe all seven escaped convicts had been living in the motor home for up to three weeks. The heavily armed inmates broke out of the maximum-security prison Connally Unit in Kenedy, southeast of San Antonio, on Dec. 13. Eleven days later, they allegedly shot and killed a policeman during a robbery at a sporting goods store near Dallas. The escape was the largest from a Texas state prison in modern history. A $500,000 reward had been offered for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the officer's killer, but there was no word yet Tuesday on how or when that money might be distributed. Three of the inmates left the RV park Monday and drove to a convenience store, where they were arrested by SWAT officers who boxed in the stolen Jeep Cherokee they were driving. ``They were so overwhelmed. They couldn't do anything,'' said SWAT team commander Terry Maketa. Three of the men had handguns and Maketa braced for the worst while aiming his own pistol at one of the men. ``I thought at one point he was contemplating getting into a gunfight,'' he said. Captured were suspected ringleader George Rivas, 30, a convicted kidnapper and burglar; and Michael Rodriguez, 38, and Joseph Garcia, 29, both convicted of murder. They did not resist or draw their weapons, authorities said. Randy Halprin, 23, walked out of the motor home, unaware of the presence of police. When Halprin realized he was surrounded, he ran to a nearby trailer, then emerged and surrendered, El Paso County Sheriff John Wesley Anderson said. Authorities said Halprin, who was serving time for beating an infant, had an old wound he may have suffered during the Christmas Eve robbery. Larry Harper, 37, convicted of aggravated sexual assault, killed himself inside the motor home after Halprin was captured, authorities said. ___ On the Net: Texas Department of Criminal Justice: http://www.tdcj.state.tx.us Irving Police Department: http://www.irvingpd.com

nbc news "in depth" tonight -- the capture of the texas fugitives. at any given time in this country, the fbi is looking for as many as 7,000 fugitives. and u.s. marshals are on t tfor another 14,000 wanted on state and local felony charges. one resource which has proved very helpful to law enforcement officials all over this country, as it was with the texas 7, a tv show that was almost yanked off the air. nbc's pete williams has more tonight on the impressive track record of "america's most wanted." they may not look like crime fighters, but police nationwide say they are. "america's most wanted." these phone bank operators, often the very first to know when a dangerous fugitive is spotted. can you give me a description of the vehicle or anything? anything unusual about it? as the program prepares to begin its 14th year on the air, the man who has been the host since the beginning he became a victim's advocate after his son was kidnapped and murdered. viewers call in to help. most of the people who call in, they are doing it because they just want to see these dirt bags off the street. the formula works, and the very first broadcast proved that. it featured a segment on one of the fbi's ten most wanted fugitives, convicted of four murders who escaped from an indiana prison. if you know anything about david james roberts, call now. someone did, and he was found in new york city just four days later, using an alias and running a homeless shelter. since then, the program's producers say viewer tips have led to the capture of 646 fugitives, an average of nearly one a week. we do five or six or seven cases every week. and they are all coming mostly from victims who write to us and say, "somebody has killed my sister or my husband or my father, and you can't let this guy get away with it. can you please help?" while it's now the longest running series on fox, network executives tried to cancel it five years ago, citing low ratings. they backed down, faced with an intense letter-writing campaign. "american's most wanted" turned out to have friends in high places -- the fbi, u.s. marshall's service, atf, state governors, police chiefs. all spoke up to rescue the program. it's a forum by which we can highlight those cases that are high profile or very dangerous cases or cases that are a priority to us. the idea itself is as old as radio, broadcasting the names of criminals on the loose. past network shows have occasionally featured programs on actual fugitives. and many television stations offer their own crime stoppers reports on local fugitives. since we met last week, we've captured two of the ten most wanted, but there's even some out there that we still need help capturing. but when a fugitive could be anywhere from coast to coast -- we got 'em, the gang that busted out of jail in texas -- the nation's police put out their own 911 call pete williams, nbc news, washington. --

Five people believed to be members of the banned Falun Gong spiritual group doused themselves with gasoline and set themselves on fire in the middle of Tiananmen Square Tuesday afternoon, a dramatic act of protest on the eve of China's most joyous holiday, Spring Festival or Chinese New Year. One women died and the four others were severely burned ``in two suicidal blazes,'' said the New China News Agency. The self-immolation and very public suicide is the most dramatic act so far in the escalating 18-month war of wills between the Chinese government and Chinese members of Falun Gong, which the government has labeled an ``evil cult.'' While small acts of defiance by individual Falun Gong members have become a daily occurrence in Tiananmen Square over the past year, they have been mostly silent affairs that passed in the blink of an eye, as police snatched banners and hustled protesters into vans. They pale in comparison with Tuesday's chilling scene. Witnesses described Falun Gong members staggering across the vast expanse of the square, arms raised in the group's meditative pose and flames streaming from their bodies. Police rushed to douse the flames and erected a shield to keep onlookers from seeing the injured and the dead, said members of a CNN television crew who witnessed the event and were detained for a short time. Such scenes are certainly anathema to the Chinese leadership, which is pushing to win the 2008 Olympics for Beijing, over the objections of human rights groups. Tiananmen Square, the political epicenter of Beijing, is slated to be the setting for beach volleyball tournaments. Falun Gong spokesmen in New York and Hong Kong immediately distanced the group from Tuesday's event, expressing skepticism about whether the dead and injured were Falun Gong members. ``In Chapter Seven, the first sentence says it is forbidden to take a life _ that includes to take your own,'' said Gail Rachlin, a New York-based spokesman for the group, referring to the writings by the group's founder, Li Hongzhi. ``So when the Chinese government talks about all these people committing suicide, it's not true. Its totally against what we believe.'' The Chinese government had clearly been bracing itself for the potential of intensified protests by Falun Gong, both during the Chinese New Year celebration this week and again when the Olympic Selection Committee visits Beijing at the end of February. They had hoped to avert a spectacle like the one during the holiday period last year, when small groups of Falun Gong members were constantly unfurling small banners or adopting meditation poses in the square. As has generally been the case, most were poor, middle-aged people from the countryside. Hundreds, at least, were arrested during that period. And a number of them were pushed and kicked as they were herded into police vans, sometimes with foreign television cameras rolling. Some were ultimately sent to labor camps, but most were sent back to their home provinces for some ``education,'' which was the policy at that early stage of the government's battle with the group. Since then both sides have become more intransigent. On Jan. 1, Li posted a message on the group's Web site suggesting that the group's cardinal principle of ``forbearance'' might not be appropriate in all situations. And protest activity has become increasingly defiant in the last few months, as members have started covertly posting the group's leaflets in subway stations and slipping them under apartment doors. Since late last year, the numbers of protesters arrested on the square have been increasing to often dozens a day and the government has become increasingly frustrated with a group that just will not give up. In addition, some protesters are coming to Beijing without identity papers and have refused to tell police where they are from, making their ready disposal a vexing problem. Earlier this month, a high-level circular told the leaders of government work units that they would be held personally responsible for employees who protested in Tiananmen. Since the group was banned 18 months ago, hundreds of thousands of members have been detained by police, at least briefly. Thousands are in labor camps, according to human rights groups, which have confirmed that about 100 have died in custody. In the past few weeks, the Chinese state news media have stepped up propaganda against the group, calling it a tool of foreign anti-Chinese forces and defending the government ban as ``the will of the Chinese people.'' ``The people have expressed their deep concern over the cult's harmful effect on families, the health of the Falun Gong practitioners themselves, China's social stability as well as its illegal profits,'' said Xinhua, the government news agency. Last week several newspapers contained long accounts about hundreds of Falun Gong members who had been released from labor camps or whose sentences had been reduced, generally after giving up their practice and denouncing the spiritual group. At least one of those members, a sculptor named Zhang Kunlun who holds both Canadian and Chinese passports, denied once he had returned to Canada that he had broken ties with Falun Gong. A brief report put out by the news agency concerning Tuesday's suicide said that the five ``cult members,'' who were all from Kaifeng, in Henan province, had been ``hoodwinked by the evil fallacies of Li Hongzhi.'' The gruesome event was not reported on the television news, which focused mostly on feel-good stories related to the Chinese New Year. The square remained open late Tuesday and into the evening, but on a freezing cold day, police in uniform and in civilian dress generally outnumbered the usual array of strollers and tourists. After the immolation on Tiananmen Square, there were at least a few of the more commonplace Falun Gong protests, which are by now regarded with only mild curiosity by Beijing residents. In late afternoon, as a middle-aged man in a worn padded jacket tried to unfurl a small yellow banner _ only to be escorted away by police _ an onlooker remarked, ``Another one from the countryside.'' Still there were signs of the disaster that had come earlier in the day: Fire extinguishers had been added to the array of police vans and other equipment that now routinely graces the square. Police were frisking and checking identity papers _ giving extra scrutiny to those who carried water bottles, smelling the contents to check for gasoline.

Hiding out for three weeks in a southern Colorado trailer park with a small arsenal of weapons and thousands of dollars in cash, seven fugitives from Texas casually mingled with neighbors and shopped at local stores, but always without drawing too much attention to themselves, residents of the area said Tuesday. The men's stay at the Coachlight Motel and R.V. Park in Woodland Park, Colo., ended abruptly on Monday when the authorities apprehended four of them, and a fifth, unwilling to surrender, shot himself to death inside the motor home in which the men were living. The two others remained on the loose Tuesday, although investigators said they had found a van in a motel parking lot in Colorado Springs, about 20 miles southeast of the Coachlight, that the two had used to leave the trailer park on Sunday. Investigators said they were still piecing together how the men traveled undetected from Texas, why they chose Woodland Park for their hideout and what they did during three weeks there. But it was clear to several of their neighbors that the men did as much as they could to fit in, and one of the men even attended a Bible-reading group at the park. Marilyn Murray, who lives with her three teenage boys next door to where the fugitives' 34-foot motor home was parked, said she and her sons saw the men frequently. ``They told people they were here to attend a religious convention,'' Murray said in an interview Tuesday. ``Whenever they would go outside to work on a vehicle, they would play religious music.'' They often worked on the three vehicles they seemed to own _ the motor home, the van that was found Tuesday and a Jeep Cherokee in which three of the men _Joseph C. Garcia, Michael Anthony Rodriguez and George Rivas _ were apprehended on Monday outside a convenience store about a mile away. The fourth, Randy Halprin, gave himself up later, walking out of the motor home several hours before Larry Harper, who was also inside, killed himself. The seven arranged an elaborate escape on Dec. 13 from a Texas prison. They are suspected of robbing a sporting goods store in Irving, Texas, on Christmas Eve, killing a police officer in the process. But their whereabouts were a mystery until last Sunday, after residents of the Coachlight watched the television program ``America's Most Wanted'' and notified local authorities that the Texas Seven, as they had come to be known, were living among them. In Woodland Park, the men kept a relatively low profile, but not so much that anyone would have regarded them as reclusive. John F. Clark, a chief inspector in charge of domestic investigations for the U.S. Marshals Office in Texas, said Harper had attended the park's Thursday night Bible sessions regularly. Gina Holder, an owner of the Coachlight, said Harper identified himself as Brother Jim. ``We knew from his prison time that he was a born-again Christian,'' Clark said. ``That was something that helped it fit.'' Murray said two of her sons had conversations with two of the fugitives. She said that her oldest, Mark, 17, ``bummed cigarettes'' from a man that he now believed was Rivas, 30, who was serving 99 years for kidnapping and burglary, and that he found him ``very congenial.'' Another neighbor, Randy Judd, said he, too, assumed the men were religious, largely from the ``Christian music'' he heard them playing ``real loud and all the time.'' But he never made much small talk with the men, Judd said. ``It was odd,'' he said. ``As we would approach any of them or try to associate with them, they would shy away, avoid eye contact, especially when they first moved in.'' When the men left the grounds, they often went to the nearby Western Convenience Store and Gas Station. ``They had been coming in every day to get coffee and pastries,'' said Sammi McCombs, the assistant manager, recalling morning visits. ``I remember one time it was all seven of them. Usually, it was just the three that were here yesterday. Two of them stayed quiet. One that paid was usually talkative.'' For the three who drove for coffee on Monday it was a fateful visit. As they approached the shop, the men were surrounded by law enforcement officers with guns drawn. A tense moment followed. ``We didn't see instantaneous compliance,'' Mark Mershon, special agent in charge of the Denver office of the FBI, said at a news conference here Tuesday. ``We felt they were contemplating a run and making a gun battle of it before they gave up.'' Each of the men was carrying a handgun, Mershon said. He said investigators completed their search Tuesday of the motor home, where they found 35 loaded weapons, including handguns, assault weapons and sawed-off shotguns. He said they also found thousands of rounds of ammunition, thousands of dollars in cash and receipts from stores in Denver and one of its suburbs, Aurora, for the purchase of bullet-proof vests. The vests, he added, have not been found, leading the authorities to think they might have been taken by the two men still at large, Patrick Murphy Jr. and Donald Newbury. Mershon said a reward of about $500,000 was being offered for information leading to their capture. The authorities said they were led to the van the two had used after workers at the Hungry Farmer restaurant noticed it in their lot near the motel early Tuesday. ``I don't think they are around,'' said Wilma David, 65, a baker at the restaurant. ``There are railroad tracks and a gulch and the highway all right here. So they're probably long gone.'' Tom Strickland, the U.S. attorney for Colorado, said at the news conference that the authorities in Texas and Colorado had agreed to drop all federal charges against the men in custody to expedite their extradition to Texas. In providing details of the events of the last few days, Mershon and Strickland said they could not discuss some evidence, including how the fugitives settled upon Woodland Park, a small town of 7,000. Mershon said he could not rule out the possibility that one of the men had a friend or relative in the area, a possibility bolstered by Judd and Murray. Both said that over the men's first weekend at the trailer park, they saw three other cars parked near the motor home. ``I know they had company,'' Murray said. Judd berated himself for not being more suspicious. ``I could kick myself,'' he said. ``If I had only known. I was in perfect position to have taken some incredible photographs.''

The State Department will review security procedures for the U.S. ambassador in Yemen after Tuesday's hijacking of a domestic Yemeni flight that carried the ambassador and three other American officials. Yemen has been a focus of U.S. attention about terrorism since last October, when the destroyer USS Cole was targeted in an attack while refueling at a Yemeni port. Seventeen sailors were killed. None of the four on the hijacked aircraft was from the State Department's diplomatic security office, responsible for the safety of official U.S. personnel and facilities. U.S. officials said security personnel don't always accompany the ambassador on domestic flights. Accompanying Ambassador Barbara Bodein, a career diplomat, were her top aide, a political officer and a defense attache. They were flying from San`a, Yemen's capital, to Taiz 125 miles away for a meeting with President Ali Abdullah Saleh and the U.S. Central Command commander in chief, General Tommy Franks when the commercial plane was diverted to the east African nation Djibouti, where the hijacker was captured. ``We'll certainly look at the security situation and try to understand what implications it might have for how we protect our ambassador,'' State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said. ``I'm sure people will make changes if they feel they are necessary.'' The hijacker, an admirer of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, asked to be flown to Iraq but the pilot insisted on stopping in Djibouti, across the Red Sea from Yemen, citing a need to refuel, U.S. officials said. The hijacker reportedly was carrying a pistol in the shape of a pen. On landing in Djibouti, the hijacker was overpowered by the crew as the passengers escaped down an emergency chute at the rear of the plane. U.S. officials said it is not unusual for top embassy officials to travel domestically in Yemen on the same aircraft, pointing out the relative lack of transportation opportunities in Yemen. The attack on the Cole and increased U.S.-Yemeni security cooperation were to have been discussed at the meeting in Taiz. Boucher said there was no indication that the hijacker, identified as Mohammed Yehia Ali Sattar, a Yemeni, was aware that Americans were on the plane. Saleh dispatched his presidential aircraft to Djibouti to bring the American passengers and Yemen's ambassador back to Yemen. That flight arrived safely in San`a, Boucher said. He thanked the crew of the hijacked aircraft for their ``swift and excellent actions.'' He also praised the governments of Yemen and Djibouti for their ``professional handling'' of the incident. ``We hope that the hijacker, who's now in custody in Djibouti, will be prosecuted to the full extent of the law for this crime,'' Boucher said. ___ On the Net: State Department's Near East bureau: http://www.state.gov/www/regions/nea/index.html State Department's Bureau of Diplomatic Security: http://ds.state.gov/ Library of Congress country notes: http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/csquery.html

Martina Hingis spoiled a potential sibling showdown at the Australian Open by winning a dramatic marathon from Serena Williams 6-2, 3-6, 8-6 to complete the women's quarterfinals Wednesday. Williams' sister, Venus, earlier overcame a slow start and a late deficit to edge Amanda Coetzer in another extended third set, 2-6, 6-1, 8-6. In Thursday's semifinals, the top-seeded Hingis will renew her rivalry with third-seeded Venus Williams, who needs two more victories for her third consecutive Grand Slam tournament title. Hingis leads the matchup 9-7, but Williams won both meetings last year en route to titles at Wimbledon and the U.S. Open. Defending champion Lindsay Davenport, seeded second, will play No. 12 Jennifer Capriati in the other semifinal. Hingis is bidding for her sixth Grand Slam tournament title but her first in two years. She trailed 4-1 in the third set and was two points from defeat at 5-4, deuce. But she broke Williams' serve to reach 5-5, then broke again in the final game, winning the second match point with an overhead smash. The victory took 2 hours, 19 minutes. Williams struggled with her serve, committed 54 errors and complained of an upset stomach. She received treatment from a trainer during several changeovers, and she sometimes grimaced or bent over in apparent discomfort between points. Venus Williams trailed Coetzer 5-3 in the final set and won despite a whopping 56 unforced errors. ``I pretty much fought for everything I got,'' Venus Williams said. ``Toward the end I cut down on my errors and moved forward. I had been in that situation many times before. I had the experience of being in the hole.'' Defending men's champ Andre Agassi, seeded sixth, will play No. 12 Patrick Rafter in the men's semifinals Thursday night. Rafter reached the final four in his country's biggest tournament for the first time by beating No. 14 Dominik Hrbaty 6-2, 6-7 (4), 7-5, 6-0 Tuesday night. No. 5 Yevgeny Kafelnikov was the top-seeded player remaining in the other half of the draw. Venus Williams is 11 inches taller than the 5-foot-2 Coetzer and hits her serves 25 mph faster, which made their pairing look like a mismatch. For a while it was. Coetzer, seeded 10th, was content to keep the ball in play and wait for errors by an erratic Williams, who lost the first eight points, lost 16 of the first 19 and fell behind 4-0. In the first set she committed 19 errors and hit just one winner. ``Let's go, Venus, wake up!'' a fan shouted. She did, holding serve with an ace to start the second set, then breaking for the first time when Coetzer double-faulted. Mistakes began to creep into the South African's game, while Williams tamed her wild strokes somewhat. ``I really had to pick myself up if I wanted to stay in the tournament,'' Williams said. ``I don't like to lose, and I just really didn't want to.'' But the rallies became especially sloppy down the stretch. Coetzer served for the victory at 5-3 but quickly committed four unforced errors and lost the game. Williams then had a chance to serve it out at 6-5 but won only one point, double-faulted and hit three groundstrokes wide to lose the game. Williams broke again, then concluded the ragged victory with an overhead winner. She smiled and sagged her shoulders in relief at her second consecutive three-set win. ``Today,'' she admitted, ``was not one of my better days.'' The start of the match was delayed half an hour by a shower that caught tournament officials by surprise. Play began after the retractable center court roof was closed for only the second time in the tournament. Asked about playing indoors, Williams said she regretted wearing a cap during the match. ``It affected my hairstyle,'' she said. ``If I had known they were going to close the roof, I would have worn a ponytail.''

good wednesday morning to you, i'm kathleen kennedy, in for jacque today. our top story this half hour -- prosecutors in dallas say they plan to seek the death penalty against the newly recaptured texas fugitives, pending their extradition. the final two convicts were arrested early this morning in colorado springs, colorado, and are now in custody. they emerged unarmed from the hotel where they were holed up, and surrendered peacefully to the fbi and local authorities. they had agreed to turn themselves in after they were each given the chance to speak with a local tv reporter by phone for about five minutes. during that conversation, they complained about the conditions in texas prisons. and they also shed some light on how they were able to elude authorities. okay, yes, we attempted to be as friendly and as neighborly as we could, as far as the christian meetings were, that was only one man. he was the man who committed suicide. that was part of the cover, i guess you could say. we were trying to -- he was trying to pass us off as a -- like a church work crew traveling around. police say they quickly surrounded the hotel after getting a tip the fugitives were there. the hotel is just two blocks from a parking lot where their van was found yesterday. after the convicts surrendered, police got a search warrant for the room. they say what they found justified their decision to negotiate, instead of using immediate force. we were very happy there was a peaceful resolution and everyone worked together to avoid a conflict. during the course of the negotiations, we obtained a search warrant for the room and recovered the additional 12 guns so now all the weapons have been recovered, all 60, from the original seven are now in police custody with no more crime guns on the street. so you can't ask for anything better in terms of an atf investigation. the men arrested this morning have been identified as patrick murphy jr., a convicted rapist, and donald newbury, who was convicted of armed robbery. if murphy, newbury, and the other four captured fugitives waive extradition, authorities say they could be back in texas by the end of the week. if not, officials say it could take four to six weeks before legal proceedings are completed for their return.

Cornered in a hotel room, the last two Texas prison escapees surrendered without a fight early Wednesday, 42 days after they broke out of a maximum security unit with an arsenal of weapons. Patrick Murphy Jr., a 39-year-old rapist, and Donald Newbury, a 38-year-old robber, walked bare chested out of the hotel room where they had been holed up after about five hours of negotiations with police and an interview with a TV station. ``They had their say by telephone and then we had them back out of the room, shirtless, hands in the air, no weapons on them,'' FBI agent Mark Mershon said. The men each had a five-minute telephone interview with Colorado Springs' KKTV before surrendering at 3:45 a.m. Newbury told anchorman Eric Singer the Dec. 13 breakout was a statement against Texas' judicial system. ``We had a statement to make that the system is as corrupt as we are. You going to do something about us, well, do something about that system, too,'' Newbury said. Murphy said he was up for parole when he broke out. ``What forced me to do this was the penal institution and such. The way Texas has things set up ... I'd eventually become an outlaw again anyway because of parole stipulations and such.'' ``I hope that maybe what we're doing here will open the eyes of people.'' Newbury and Muprhy were handcuffed and put into separate patrol cars that slowly rolled out of the parking lot of the Holiday Inn. They were taken to the police department and were to be transferred to the El Paso County jail, also in Colorado Springs. Their four surviving companions were held in a detention center in Teller County about 20 miles away. ``This episode is now closed and finalized,'' police Lt. Skip Arms said. ``I think they felt that they had some message that they wanted to convey,'' Arms said. ``Since we showed a level of trust to them, they followed through and showed a level of trust and did follow through on their commitment.'' The arrests brought to an end a frustrating hunt _ one of the largest in the Southwest's history _ for the seven convicts who bluffed their way out of the prison in Kenedy, Texas, southeast of San Antonio. Four were arrested peacefully Monday at a convenience store and at a motor home in nearby Woodland Park. A fifth killed himself in the motor home as authorities closed in. Authorities have said the men robbed an Irving, Texas, sporting goods store and killed Officer Aubrey Hawkins when he arrived. He was shot 11 times and run over by a vehicle. That heightened fears the men would not surrender peacefully. ``Now we can get down to business and get some changes in this lousy Texas penal system,'' Jayne Hawkins, the officer's mother told The Associated Press on Wednesday. ``My son will not die in vain.'' The seven arrived in Colorado the last week in December, spending time in Pueblo, about 100 miles south of Denver, before renting a space for their motor home in the Coachlight Motel and RV Park in Woodland Park around Jan. 1. ``We had to drive out of the Texas snow storm that hit right at Christmas Eve in the Amarillo area and we had to drive through the blizzard for hours and literally, Colorado was just a random pick,'' Murphy said during his interview. They led the park manager and neighbors to believe they were Christian missionaries en route from Texas to California, while keeping as many as three dozen weapons, loaded and cocked, in the cramped RV. ``We joked about it often, but it really was just by downplaying ourselves and changing our hair color and such,'' Murphy said. ``We attempted to be as friendly and neighborly as we could.'' Authorities believe Murphy and Newbury split from the others last weekend because they wanted to obtain more money. After the four were arrested Monday, police and FBI agents began to close in on Murphy and Newbury. The next day, they found their van abandoned in a motel parking lot two blocks from the Holiday Inn. Since no vehicles had been reported stolen, officers searched door to door. They received a tip the two were at the Holiday Inn and surrounded the hotel, opening negotiations via telephone at about 10 p.m. It was a weekend airing of the prison escapees' story on the television show ``America's Most Wanted'' that finally broke the case. A $500,000 reward had been offered for information leading to the conviction of the officer's killer, but there was no immediate word on how or when that money might be distributed. The show prompted several tips from residents that the fugitives may be in Woodland Park, a bedroom community of about 8,000 15 miles northwest of Colorado Springs. At a convenience store, authorities arrested suspected ringleader George Rivas, 30, who was serving a life sentence for aggravated robbery and kidnapping; and Michael Rodriguez, 38, and Joseph Garcia, 29, both murderers. At the same time, authorities surrounded the fugitives' motor home. Randy Halprin, 23, who had been serving time for beating an infant, surrendered. Larry Harper, 37, convicted of aggravated sexual assault, shot himself to death inside the RV. Murphy had been serving 50 years for aggravated sexual assault with a deadly weapon. Newbury was sentenced to 99 years for robbing a woman at a hotel in 1997 with a sawed-off shotgun. ___ On the Net: Texas Department of Criminal Justice: http://www.tdcj.state.tx.us Irving Police Department: http://www.irvingpd.com

Serena Williams couldn't beat Martina Hingis despite a 4-1 lead in the final set. Now it is sister Venus' turn to try. Wimbledon, U.S. Open and Olympic champion Venus almost didn't do her part to reach the Australian Open semifinals. She sprayed 56 errors before surviving a late service break and beating No. 10 Amanda Coetzer 2-6, 6-1, 8-6 Wednesday. Then the top-seeded Hingis spoiled a sibling semifinal by rallying for a 6-2, 3-6, 8-6 victory over Serena, who had 54 errors _ 29 of them in the final set. ``I was able to keep going and going until she would miss,'' Hingis said. Before going out to play doubles an hour after her singles, Serena sent word that she had not eaten anything but toast for two days because of food poisoning. She and Venus then beat Anna Kournikova and Barbara Schett 3-6, 6-1, 6-1 to advance to a semifinal against Hingis and Monica Seles. In an Australian Open warmup tournament, Hingis and Seles beat the Williams sisters. Serena said later that ``some pink stuff'' the trainer gave her after her first set of singles helped her recover by the third set from a dizzy feeling and to get her feet moving. After the doubles, she added, ``I could play another match.'' The men's side will have the first all-French semifinal at a Grand Slam tournament since 1983, between No. 15 Arnaud Clement and No. 16 Sebastien Grosjean. The winner becomes the first French finalist in an Australian Open since 1928. Clement capitalized on 79 errors by No. 5 Yevgeny Kafelnikov for a 6-4, 5-7, 7-6 (3), 7-6 (3) victory, and celebrated by throwing his shirt and shoes into the crowd of nearly 15,000. Kafelnikov hit an overhead into the net on match point, ending a stellar run Down Under in which he won the Australian Open in 1999, was runner-up last year and won the Olympic gold medal. ``I can't believe it,'' said Clement, who has lost only one set in five matches here. In his first Grand Slam quarterfinal, Grosjean, conqueror of fourth-seeded Magnus Norman, ended the run of former No. 1 Carlos Moya with a 6-1, 6-4, 6-2 victory. Moya, coming back from injury, had beaten another former No. 1, Marcelo Rios, and seventh-seeded Lleyton Hewitt. Defending champion Andre Agassi already is in the semifinals, facing two-time U.S. Open champion Patrick Rafter on Thursday night. In three events, Hingis has defeated one Williams sister and then lost to the other, most recently at the 1999 U.S. Open, when Serena beat her in the final. Two players have beaten both in the same tournament, both in Sydney. Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario did it in 1998 and Seles in 1999. Hingis needs to beat Venus just to get to the final of what she used to consider her very own tournament. She won it three times in a row before losing to Lindsay Davenport in last year's final. Davenport plays No. 12 Jennifer Capriati on Thursday for the other spot in the championship match. The trainer brought medicine for Serena after the first set against Hingis. She went on to win the second, thanks to a second-serve ace for set point and a Hingis forehand into the net. In the final set, after Hingis had closed from 1-4 to 4-all, Serena broke for 5-4. She pumped her fist after a backhand down the line put her two points from winning. That was as close as she got. Hingis won the game with two backhand crosscourts that caught Serena off-balance. Serena held serve for 6-all, and two games later played a brilliant rally to erase Hingis' first match point. She sent Hingis running back with a lunging lob and then dived to put in a backhand angled drop volley. But she netted a forehand on the next point, and Hingis finished the 2-hour, 19-minute match with an angled overhead. Hingis said she didn't notice any indications of Williams' illness, but added: ``You have to watch what you eat.'' Hingis considered her first set the best tennis of her career. ``It was a great match from both of us. At the end, especially, it was whoever wanted it more and who was more lucky,'' she said. Thanks to playing and fitness improvements, ``you can't count on just overpowering me anymore,'' said the 20-year-old Swiss player, who is seeking her sixth Grand Slam tournament title. She has a 9-7 record against Venus, but lost their last two meetings. Serena said Hingis won ``with a lot of heart.'' Against the 5-foot-2 Coetzer, Venus, who is 6-1, lost the first eight points and first four games, prompting one fan to shout, ``Let's go, Venus, wake up!'' She did, racing through the second set. In the last set, however, errors crept back in _ 27 in the 14 games. Coetzer broke for 5-3, but then lost the next game on errors. Venus returned that favor when serving for the match at 6-5, broke yet again for 7-6 and finished in 1:46 with an overhead. ``It's just not liking to lose,'' Venus said. ``Today was not one of my better days. ... I had no more room for error.'' She said Coetzer didn't do anything wrong, and ``there were times when I really just wouldn't move forward. It was terrible. I realized that I couldn't win the match like that.'' Serena said later, ``I had a long talk with (Venus) in the locker room. She's promised not to do a game like that anymore. She'll definitely be in better form tomorrow.'' Rain delayed the start of the match by half an hour while the court was dried and the roof closed on Rod Laver Arena. The change ``affected my hairstyle,'' Venus said, because she was expecting sun and had pulled her hair back to put on a visor. ``If I had known they were going to close the roof, I would have worn a ponytail,'' she added.

thank you for looking in. here's our top story this half hour -- the 42 day manhunt for seven texas prison escapees concluded early today when the last two fugitives surrendered. police cornered the wanted men in a colorado springs hotel room. the convicts surrendered peacefully after a six-hour standoff. shortly before they gave themselves up, authorities allowed the fugitives, patrick murphy and donald newbury, to speak by phone with local tv news anchor, eric singer. in their interviews, the men complained about the texas criminal justice system. our judicial system in the state of texas has really gone to the pits. we're receiving 99 years for a robbery, for $68. nobody's injured. there was no proof that the gun was used in the robbery other than an unreliable witness that picked out several and everything before. it was created a statement through information of my priors and everything else that apparently the prosecutor had given to him, which was apparently against the law as well. we have a texas ranger, he admitted in trial that the evidence was tainted, yet, i received 99 years. the deal is you have five minutes of peace to be able to talk. and i wasn't going to in any way take that time from him to somehow make the situation even worse. so i continued to come up with different questions that would steer them in a general direction so they wouldn't relive any kind of violent situations. they wouldn't relive what they remembered that could perhaps set the whole tone of the negotiations in a negative way. on monday, authorities arrested fugitives george rivas, michael rodriguez and joseph garcia, at a woodland park, colorado, convenience store. randy halprin surrendered to authorities at the motor home where the convicts had been living. and fugitive larry harper shot himself to death inside the home.

Cornered in a hotel room, the last two Texas prison escapees surrendered without a fight early Wednesday, 42 days after they broke out of a maximum security unit with an arsenal of weapons. Patrick Murphy Jr., a 39-year-old rapist, and Donald Newbury, a 38-year-old robber walked bare chested out of the hotel room where they had been holed up after about five hours of negotiations with police and an interview with a TV station. A hotel employee tipped police to the possibility that the fugitives were at the hotel late Tuesday afternoon, Deputy Police Chief Luis Velez said. The two were shocked when a detective called their room about 10 p.m. Murphy answered and said: ``You got us. I don't know how you guys did it, but you got us,'' Velez recounted. Like their captured accomplices, they now face capital murder charges in Texas stemming from the slaying of a police officer during a Christmas Eve robbery near Dallas. Ten loaded handguns and two loaded shotguns were recovered in the hotel room, FBI agent Mark Mershon said. Also recovered was slain officer Aubrey Hawkins' handgun, authorities said. The men each had a five-minute telephone interview with Colorado Springs' KKTV before surrendering at 3:45 a.m. Newbury told anchorman Eric Singer the Dec. 13 breakout was a statement against Texas' judicial system. ``We had a statement to make that the system is as corrupt as we are. You going to do something about us, well, do something about that system, too,'' Newbury said. Murphy said he was up for parole when he broke out. ``What forced me to do this was the penal institution and such. The way Texas has things set up ... I'd eventually become an outlaw again anyway because of parole stipulations and such.'' ``I hope that maybe what we're doing here will open the eyes of people.'' In Irving, a police spokesman rejected what he said was an attempt by the escapees to characterize themselves as victims of the criminal justice system. ``I don't see that they were the victims. To quote the chief, Officer Hawkins was the victim. We buried the victim,'' Officer David Tull. The inmates promised a peaceful end to the standoff early in the negotiations, and authorities were not surprised they kept that commitment. ``They had their say by telephone and then we had them back out of the room, shirtless, hands in the air, no weapons on them,'' Mershon said. Newbury and Murphy were handcuffed and put into separate patrol cars that slowly rolled out of the parking lot of the Holiday Inn. Their four surviving companions were held in a detention center in Teller County about 20 miles away. The arrests brought to an end a frustrating hunt _ one of the largest in the Southwest's history _ for the seven convicts who bluffed their way out of the prison in Kenedy, Texas, after stealing 16 firearms and ammunition from a prison storage area.

Authorities said the men robbed a sporting goods store in Irving and killed Hawkins when he arrived. He was shot 11 times and run over by a vehicle.

"you got us. i don't know how you guys did it, but you got us." s.w.a.t. teams surrounded the hotel. at p.m., the hotel guests were cleared out. they have evacuated the portion of the hotel that anybody is at risk. for the next six hours, the convicts had an open line to police, who tried to coax them out without bloodshed. they have been talking to the negotiators now for several hours. and just before a.m., this exchange. hi, donald. are you on the line with me? yes, i am. hi, donald. and i assume that you're watching television? the two promise they will give themselves up if they can speak live on television to a local anchorman about the state of texas justice. they are given five minutes each. when time expired -- as honorable men, you must go outside immediately. no problem. -- to resolve the situation peacefully. they made good on their promise and surrendered at a.m. inside their hotel room, police find ten loaded handguns and two loaded shotguns. today, in irving, texas, at the precinct where murdered officer aubrey hawkins served, police were angered that the convicts portrayed themselves as victims. i don't see what they were victims. and to quote the chief, "the victim is aubrey hawkins. we've buried the victim." authorities say the six surviving members of the texas seven will be returned to texas, where they will all now face the death penalty. thanks very much, mike. mike von fremd in colorado. as mike knows, that during their brief interviews, the two convicts described what it was like when they escaped. you have to listen fairly carefully. the gate from the -- that was done as peacefully as possible. the officers were very loyal. they were the only ones that resisted. it could have ended in a bloodbath. we could have been out of there in two minutes. instead two and a half hours, we took the time to do this gently. how did the texas seven decide on colorado? we had to drive out of the snowstorm that hit right after christmas eve and we had to drive through the blizzard for hours. and literally colorado was just a random pick. you were out there several weeks. how did you, you know, hide, try to be a chameleon in the community? we attempted to be friendly and as neighborly as we could. these guys will fool you. they were your neighbors, your next door neighbors. what exactly was your day to day like? we tried to remain as calm as possible at all times. this, in fact, was the van. they've been looking for it. they're checking in the area hotels in an attempt to locate two fugitives. donald please come home or give yourself up. we don't need any more hurt. the reason i'm stepping out of h@ abc world news/peter jennings abc % h@ ng a abc world news/pet fear. it is for the last 30 days. i'll stepping out of these doors with the sole purpose of honoring the person i love and to keep my voice in the media. well, he got that today.

With a city plagued by drugs and violence as a backdrop, President Vicente Fox on Wednesday declared a nationwide war on narcotics trafficking and organized crime. ``Today we initiate this great crusade,'' Fox said in the capital of Sinaloa, a Pacific coast state long considered the cradle of Mexico's extensive drug trade. ``I pledge a war without mercy.'' Fox promised a complete overhaul of the nation's corrupt prison system and strict adherence to a Mexican Supreme Court ruling last week that removed the last barriers for extraditing Mexicans for trial in the United States. His announcement came five days after the escape of one of Sinaloa's drug bosses, Joaquin ``El Chapo'' Guzman, from a maximum-security prison in the western state of Jalisco _ allegedly with the help of bribed prison officials. Fox said his government would do everything in its power to end corruption in prisons. He did not say how it would be done. The president was accompanied by his defense secretary, his attorney general and Public Security Secretary Alejandro Gertz, a new cabinet secretary appointed to fight organized crime and drug trafficking. Gertz said his office would begin official operations next week, but he did not provide details. One of the first pledges Fox made after taking office Dec. 1 was to launch an all-out war against drugs and organized crime. Last month, he sent 1,000 officers to fight drug-related violence in Culiacan after Sinaloa Gov. Juan Millan said he could no longer fight the scourge on his own. In the past three years, Culiacan has experienced an average of 500 drug-related deaths annually, and 14 people died in drug-related violence in Sinaloa in the first three days of January alone. Federal officials and anti-drug advocates in Sinaloa said traffickers are already preparing a well-organized counteroffensive against Fox's crusade. ``They are going to regroup on several fronts,'' said Leonel Aguirre, one of a group of Sinaloa lawyers that has spoken out against drug trafficking. Aguirre's brother, also a member of the group, was killed by drug traffickers. Drug bosses chased out of Culiacan by the federal police forces are relocating and creating a well-armed outfit of followers trained with military-style discipline, Aguirre and other drug-fighting activists said. They said traffickers will continue to try to use bribes, and Fox himself acknowledged his crusade ``may be a bitter fight because of the perverse influence of dirty money.'' But the president vowed to combat that influence. ``We are striking a blow by unraveling these networks of complicity,'' he said. Government officials said they have made progress fighting drugs during the first 50 days under Fox, whose election last year ended seven decades of rule by the Institutional Revolutionary Party, which was widely accused of corrution. Since Fox took office, authorities have arrested 489 people accused of involvement in drug trafficking and removing 15 federal agents in the northern state of Chihuahua who were alleged to be receiving payoffs from drug traffickers, they said. They also said they had seized about twice as much cocaine, marijuana and hallucinogenic drugs as was confiscated during the first 50 days of former President Ernesto Zedillo's administration in 1994.

The stifling humidity had left Lindsay Davenport with molasses in her blood and lead in her shoes, while an energized Jennifer Capriati kept bouncing on the court like a boxer on canvas. She was poised for anything, for Davenport's atomic serve or heavy ground strokes, even for a trick or two. In the fifth game of the second set, a desperate Davenport, trying a sleight of hand, brushed a drop shot just over the net only to see a muscular Capriati rocket forward. She not only raced to retrieve the shot, Capriati also scooped a running forehand down the line for a winner. Davenport did not even move, as if anchored in her disbelief. Was this really happening? But under 95-degree heat, in the hot box of Rod Laver Arena, a player who has shown the elasticity to come back from her dark past had the resilience to keep coming Thursday afternoon. It was quite an arrival. Eleven years after Capriati turned professional at age 13, she fought her way past the looming defending champion of the Australian Open, 6-3, 6-4, to reach the first Grand Slam event final of her career. She'll face another player who stunned everyone Thursday. With unexpected speed, the top-seeded Martina Hingis became the first player to defeat both of the Williams sisters in a major, effortlessly dismantling an error-prone Venus Williams, 6-1, 6-1, in the second semifinal. Fifty-three minutes after the first serve, Williams smacked her 38th error of the day into the net on match point. A day after both survived draining three-set victories, Hingis was the one with the recovery powers. She was quicker, more precise and fresher. But as a five-time winner at a Grand Slam, Hingis has been here before, though. Capriati's wait has been much longer. ``I really wanted it, and it has taken me a long time,'' Capriati said. ``It's something I really wanted. I was really determined before the match. I just gave it everything I had. ``I got my chance last year, and it was great. But I didn't want to give up a second chance.'' A year ago, Capriati was in this same position. She had completed the circle from her 1991 U.S. Open semifinal, through her dysfunctional teen tailspin, back to the spotlight of a major. Even though she lost in the semifinals to Davenport last year, she was in good position to fully resurrect her standing among the elite players. Capriati was fit, happy and following the direction of her coach, Harold Solomon. But Capriati started funneling her energies to her boyfriend, the tennis player Xavier Malisse, split with Solomon and lost her fitness level with her father back in charge of her career. But in the off-season, she rediscovered her discipline. And Thursday, with her father, Stefano, looking on as her coach, Capriati stood as an example of perseverance. She was back _ one more time. ``I know there were maybe some expectations coming into this tournament with me trying to make the semis again,'' Capriati said after she defeated Monica Seles to make the semifinals. ``Expectations like am I in good of shape, and my dad's my coach, and all those things. I think it's just more gratifying to kind of live up to those expectations and go beyond. ``It's great. But I didn't get to this point just to be happy that I got to this far.'' She wanted more. And in the second set, she grabbed it. Just after her amazing get of Davenport's drop shot, she corralled a wild shot by Davenport that glanced off the net post and bounded into the center of the court. Unfazed by the bizarre ricochet, Capriati put away the short ball with her steady forehand to break Davenport and take a 3-2 lead. Capriati maintained her advantage through the end of the match. On her first match point, Capriati was a little too eager to finish it off. She served up a double fault with a big second serve. On her second match point, she watched Davenport end a rally with a forehand into the net. Euphoric, Capriati grabbed her head with both hands and smiled at her father. ``It was tough because in the first two games, she came out playing well,'' Davenport said. ``It put pressure on myself to do more and not to let her get a good hit at the ball. She played great, and she was fired up. I wasn't playing that well. And if you combine the two, it wasn't all that close. ``In all the semifinals I've ever played, this was the most disappointed I've ever been. I didn't come out. I came all this way and didn't play that well.'' Davenport was supposed to do more. But her path through the tournament hadn't been particularly impressive. She had struggled to get by lesser opponents, often having to rely on her big serve to bail her out of sticky situations. Davenport didn't have that weapon Thursday. She hit only 58 percent on her first serve, failed to blast a single ace and committed 43 unforced errors. Capriati served up four aces and had only 19 unforced errors. ``Jennifer is a great girl,'' Davenport said. ``It's great for her to have come through all that she has, but I'd still rather be in the final.'' Davenport wasn't focused on the prize at the start of the match. Quickly, Capriati used a strong first serve and blasted a flurry of forehands by a flat-footed Davenport to go up a break, 2-0. A little out of sync, a sluggish Davenport regrouped to find her ground stokes in the third game and forced four break points. But Capriati was undaunted. She kept the pressure on with deep shots until Davenport punched a backhand into the net. Capriati held serve to go up by 3-0. Davenport had her chances to pounce on a slight hiccup in Capriati's game, but botched double break point in the seventh game of the first set. Davenport smacked her racket on the ground after she cracked a running forehand into the net, then did it again as she whipped a forehand return into the net. On the changeover, down by 5-2, Davenport kicked her racket as if to punish it for her own mistakes. Under the pressure of a very agile Capriati, who was able to field the angled, heavy ground strokes that beat most players, Davenport ended the first set exasperated after her 18 unforced errors. ``Maybe Lindsay even underestimated me in the beginning,'' Capriati said. ``She didn't think I'd come out so strong.'' The last time Capriati surprised everyone like this, she won a gold medal for the 1992 American Olympic team. She has always said that was the highlight of her career. ``I didn't know if anything could top winning the gold, but this is great,'' Capriati said. ``We'll see when the final day comes.''

The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, Jan. 25: Anger over Bill Clinton's abuse of the pardoning process mounted Wednesday, as well it should. This page has criticized Clinton for his last-minute pardon of the fugitive commodities trader Marc Rich. But a broader look at Clinton's final pardon list makes clear that the outrage extends well beyond the undeserved leniency for Rich. We are particularly troubled by the numerous instances in which Clinton granted pardons or commutations without proper consultation with federal prosecutors, often to reward friends or political allies or gain future political advantage. Consider, for example, Clinton's decision to commute the sentences of four Hasidic men from New Square, N.Y., who were in prison for defrauding the government by inventing a fictitious religious school and using it to attract millions in government aid. The commutations were granted after the president Clinton and his wife, Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton, met privately in December with supporters of the men, whose politically active sect had overwhelmingly backed Mrs. Clinton in her victorious Senate campaign. Mrs. Clinton denies any responsibility for the president's commutation decision and denies even knowing that commutation would be discussed. But her presence at the meeting surely underscores her interest in accommodating these constituents. The U.S. attorney in New York, Mary Jo White, vigorously opposed the commutations, which she learned about only at the last minute. Politics rather than a careful weighing of the merits also appears to have been the deciding factor in Clinton's pardon of Edward Downe Jr., a contributor to Mrs. Clinton and other Democrats, who pleaded guilty in the early 1990s to insider trading and was sentenced to probation and stiff fines. Prosecutors in White's office learned of the pardon decision last Friday _ too late to effectively register their objections. Similarly, William Fugazy, a confidant of several politicians, including Mayor Rudolph Giuliani of New York, and a prominent figure in civic affairs, was granted a pardon for his perjury in a bankruptcy proceeding over White's objections. Fugazy's lawyer said he had successfully sought help from an unnamed political figure to carry his request to the White House. In the same vein, Rep. Jerrold Nadler, a Manhattan Democrat, served as a courier who forwarded pardon information to the White House for Susan Rosenberg, a former member of the Weather Underground serving a lengthy sentence for her role in an explosives and weapons case. Nadler says he took no position on the pardon, which was opposed by White's office. Of course, some people close to the president had no need for special access to gain his attention. Clinton's pardons of his brother, Roger Clinton, who served time years ago on cocaine charges, and of Susan McDougal, who went to jail for refusing to answer questions about Clinton's Whitewater dealings, were clear distortions of the pardoning process to help friends and family. The president's power to grant pardons is absolute, and it is meant to correct injustices or perform a civic good. But the properly intense furor over Clinton's pardon of Rich led Sen. Tom Daschle, the Senate Democratic leader, to suggest that Congress might need to review the president's unilateral power to dispense pardons. That seems an unnecessary assault on a fundamental constitutional power. But such congressional concern should be a signal to future chief executives that in this matter, as in other aspects of presidential judgment, Clinton is not a role model to follow. President Bush can help restore trust in this important presidential responsibility by committing himself to abide by the traditional process of Justice Department review before a pardon is granted.

All night long, Patrick Rafter looked as if he'd just walked in from a downpour with the way his shirt stuck to his skin and his sneakers squished when he darted to the net. Eventually, the sultry air inside Rod Laver Arena simply squeezed his body, leaving him short on fluids and low on hope against Andre Agassi Thursday night. Using his aggressive serve-and-volley game in brilliant contrast to the tactical ground strokes and reflex returns of Agassi, Rafter had been up two sets to one during their semifinal match when he began to feel the muscles in his legs begin to seize during the fourth set. He kept pushing, though, right through the painful end, if only for the Aussies who packed the stands to see their beloved star for perhaps the last time. ``I wasn't going to walk off when I was possibly playing my last match at an Australian Open,'' said Rafter, who may retire after this season. ``I was going to play it out whether I lost 6-love or whatever. I was going to play it out.'' The cramps just would not let go. By the fifth set, he was limping to the net, staggering to reach Agassi's ground strokes and watched helplessly as passing shots whistled by him. Although he admires Rafter, Agassi was unrelenting against his friend. Agassi had earned this advantage with his supreme conditioning efforts, and he was not about to let it go, taking the hyped semifinal 7-5, 2-6, 6-7 (5), 6-2, 6-3. The sixth-seeded defending champion will play the winner of Friday's all-French semifinal between Arnaud Clement and Sebastien Grosjean. But for 2 hours of Thursday night's three-hour match, Rafter appeared to be the one en route to a storybook final. ``It was hot and humid out there, but I didn't handle it quite as well,'' said Rafter who had never advanced past the fourth round of his home-based major before this week. ``It's more frustrating knowing I had a chance. I was playing very well. I was happy with the way I was playing. To fall short because of some physical imbalance, that's just the frustrating part of it. ``Sometimes, I can control the sweating and my intensity during the match. I can do things to sort of help me relax a little better. But tonight was not one of those nights.'' It was too big a match to relax. Inside the arena, there was a rock-concert atmosphere surrounding two players who are as universally loved as ice cream. But even though the Aussies cheered politely for the American star, they erupted with the excitement of a lottery winner the moment Agassi rifled a backhand return wide to give Rafter the third-set tiebreaker. ``Two sets to one down, that was a problem,'' Agassi said, ``especially against a guy who knows how to win.'' Rafter could almost touch a victory until the cramps crept into both of his thighs early in the fourth set. Until that point, he and Agassi had left the fans mesmerized. In the third game of the third set, Agassi, snapping back return winners on every second serve Rafter would give him, forced two break points. But as if to top Agassi's cool with his own, Rafter erased each break point by uncorking two aces. It was hard to find flaw in either player. Through three sets, the baseline-bound Agassi had committed just 11 errors, while Rafter was winning nearly 70 percent of the points with his throwback net game. ``At the end of the day, you just want to make him earn it if he wins,'' Agassi said. ``That's all I was trying to do, just play a great match. It turned out to be a great match that happened to go my way.'' With his ability to methodically dismantle the power of physically ominous opponents, Agassi may have won even if Rafter had remained healthy. But when Rafter was visited by a trainer after the third game of the fourth set, Agassi's tactics became much clearer. As cold as it might sound, he had to launch a calculated attack. ``It's a fine line when your opponent starts struggling,'' Agassi said. ``You want to make him play, but you can't afford to give a guy a window to take the offense in the point. ``I think the biggest factor was what he lost in his serve. I could really make him play a lot of volleys. It's hard to dig out volleys if your legs are going on you. Once that was going on him, he was in a tough predicament.'' It was a difficult scene for the crowd to take. They kept chanting Rafter's name during changeovers and calling out support in between points, but they possessed no healing powers. Instead, they had to watch his painful finish. At the end of a baseline rally, a nearly immobile Rafter sliced a backhand long on match point. Agassi hardly celebrated. He met Rafter at the net, leaned toward him and said, ``Great fight.'' Rafter then gathered his things, waved in appreciation of a raucous ovation and departed through the tunnel beneath the stands. About a half hour later, Rafter discussed just how devastating his exit was for him to take. ``It's tough when you want to chase it down, but your legs seize up,'' Rafter said. ``My heart feels fine. It feels like it wants to run. I want to run, but my legs won't do it. It's disappointing for the public and for myself. But they were great. They understood the situation there.''

The ex-wife of pardoned financier Marc Rich said her political donations of more than $1 million to Democrats since 1993 were unrelated to President Clinton's grant of clemency during his last few hours in office. Denise Rich said it was ``entirely appropriate'' for her to be among those who petitioned Clinton to pardon the indicted financier who has been living in Switzerland, where he fled in the 1980s. ``The pardon given to Marc Rich will give him the opportunity to visit his daughter's grave for the first time,'' Denise Rich said in a statement issued Wednesday through a spokesman, New York publicist Howard J. Rubenstein. The Riches' daughter, Gabrielle, died from cancer in 1996. ``Her political fund-raising and charitable activities have absolutely nothing to do with the pardon granted to her former husband,'' the statement added. One of Rich's lawyers, former Clinton White House counsel Jack Quinn, told The New York Times in Thursday's editions, that the president's decision was based on an 11th hour conversation the two men had had that focused strictly on the case. ``Every word I had with the president was about the legal merits,'' Quinn said. ``He was not focused on 'Are they Democrats?' or 'Is Denise this?' He was focused on the distinction I was making about whether this ought to have been treated as a civil or criminal matter.'' In the few public comments he has made regarding the issue, Clinton indicated that his decision was based on Quinn's presentation of the case. Rich was indicted in Manhattan federal court in 1983, shortly after he fled the country, on charges of tax fraud and illegally buying oil from Iran during the 1979 hostage crisis. In seeking the pardon, Rich's lawyers argued that the case against him could not be brought now because of changes in the law and that similar cases have been handled as regulatory matters. The pardon has drawn strong criticism. Giuliani, a former Justice Department official and federal prosecutor who withdrew from his Senate race against the first lady, urged Congress this week to look into Clinton's pardon of Rich. U.S. Attorney Mary Jo White said her office had been ``bypassed'' by the Clinton White House as the president's aides considered the arguments of Rich, his indicted business partner and several other defendants charged in White's jurisdiction, the southern district of Manhattan. ``We were totally unaware that pardons for Marc Rich'' and his business partner ``were even under consideration,'' said White. Quinn told the Times that he had approached White's office urging them to re-examine the case, but had gotten nothing more than ``the back of the hand from'' her. Rich was a fugitive and ``I have a hard time seeing how he qualifies for a pardon,'' said Dick Thornburgh, who served as attorney general during the Reagan and Bush administrations. Thornburgh also objected because Clinton administration officials ``bypassed the normal process and kept the application secret from the law enforcement officials who brought the charges.''

The Philippine's new president on Thursday defended the street protests that swept her to power, denying they could undermine the nation's democracy. In her first news conference since taking office Saturday, Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo said the protests _ dubbed ``people power II'' after the 1986 ``people power'' revolution that toppled late dictator Ferdinand Marcos _ had strengthened the country's democracy. ``In our constitution, people power has also been enshrined,'' said Macapagal-Arroyo, who was sworn in after Joseph Estrada fled the presidential palace amid massive street demonstrations demanding his resignation for corruption and the defection of key allies. Some have said the change of power was no boost for democracy because it came in a way not set down by the constitution. Singapore elder statesman Lee Kuan Yew said as much Monday, but added that the Philippines can expect investment to flow back into the country. ``I think the bottom line is how the markets accepted it,'' Macapagal-Arroyo said Thursday. ``These are indicators of trust ... and that the strengthening of democracy is the prevailing position.'' Shares on the Philippine stock market rose by 2 percent Thursday, buoyed by expectations the new government will pursue reforms to keep the country on track to economic recovery, traders said. Shares prices have soared by 20 percent sent Estrada was toppled. Macapagal-Arroyo also used the news conference to introduce members of the partial Cabinet she has formed. Conspicuously absent from the conference was Defense Secretary Orlando Mercado, who held a simultaneous media briefing to announce he was quitting his post over her appointment of Lisandro Abadia as national security adviser. Mercado and military chief Gen. Angelo Reyes withdrew their support of Estrada last Friday, helping topple the former president. Mercado claimed Abadia was tainted by a military corruption scandal four years ago. Macapagal-Arroyo said she had not decided whether to accept Mercado's resignation. When asked about rumors of a possible coup by Marine Lt. Gen. Edgardo Espinosa, she said Espinosa was ``an old friend'' and had an aide call him on a cellular phone. ``Are you going to stage a coup against me?'' Macapagal-Arroyo asked. She listened to his response before telling reporters that he said the reports were nothing more than imagination. Espinosa leads at least three military groups that reportedly planned to defect from Estrada. There is speculation that Espinosa might not have liked Macapagal-Arroyo's decision to keep Reyes as head of the military. Reyes said Thursday that he abandoned Estrada and backed protesters last week to pre-empt possible actions by military groups that could have sparked chaos and bloodshed. After Estrada's impeachment trial stalled Jan. 16 and sparked massive street protests, Reyes said he received reports that certain military groups were preparing to ``act up'' and that communist guerrillas were reportedly heading to Manila. ``When you merge all of these and you have a very volatile situation, what will happen?'' Reyes told radio station DZRH. Also on Thursday, Justice Secretary Hernando Perez discarded fears that Estrada would try to legally regain the presidency by arguing he did not sign a resignation and had only had stepped down temporarily. ``There is no basis for President Estrada to recover his office,'' Perez said. ``He was ousted from his office. He said his farewells. As far as the law is concerned, the former president is a former president.'' The impeachment trial allegations that Estrada took bribes and kickbacks was transformed into a criminal investigation Monday on six possible charges. Since then, Estrada has been barred from leaving the country and had at least one of his bank accounts frozen.

The new Philippine president confronted coup rumors by telephoning a general Thursday, but her defense minister announced his resignation, alleging the national security adviser was corrupt. Orlando Mercado's defection was a clear blow to Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo's administration, especially since she has made clean government a top priority. Her predecessor, Joseph Estrada, was forced out last week amid allegations that he amassed a fortune in bribes and kickbacks. Although Mercado had planned to resign by Feb. 12 to run for the Senate in general elections scheduled for May, his decision to go early underscored the country's deep political divisions. He said he was resigning over Macapagal-Arroyo's appointment of Lisandro Abadia as national security adviser, alleging he was tainted by a military corruption scandal four years ago. In her first news conference since being sworn in Saturday, Macapagal-Arroyo was asked about persistent rumors of a coup, particularly involving Marine Lt. Gen. Edgardo Espinosa. ``Espinosa is an old friend of mine,'' Macapagal-Arroyo told reporters on live television. ``I will call him up right now and ask him.'' After an aide with a cellular phone got through to the general, she got on the line and asked: ``Are you going to stage a coup against me?'' She listened carefully to his response before telling the media that he said the reports were nothing more than imagination. She was upbeat in maintaining that the anti-Estrada street protests _ dubbed ``people power II'' after the 1986 ``people power'' revolution that toppled Ferdinand Marcos _ had strengthened the country's democracy. Some have said the change of power was no boost for democracy because it came in a way not set down by the constitution. Singapore elder statesman Lee Kuan Yew said as much Monday, but added that the Philippines can expect investment to flow back into the country. ``In our constitution, people power has also been enshrined,'' Macapagal-Arroyo said. ``I think the bottom line is how the markets accepted it.

on capitol hill today, house republicans were requesting documents about former president clinton's controversial pardon of the billionaire mark rich. mr. clton's pardon is the object of serious dispute. this also involves gifts to the clintons. here is abc's jackie judd. gone, but not nearly forgotten. five days out of office, and the former president, as well as his wife, still have the capacity to irritate. the clintons have no capacity for either shame or embarrassment. i tell you what, this is an outrage. i've never seen something like this. does clinton have any friends who aren't crooked? mr. clinton's pardon of fugitive financier mark rich, whose ex-wife denise gave over $1 million to the democratic party, has left former prosecutor rudolph giuliani fuming. i'm very disappointed and shocked that the president of the united states would pardon him. i don't understand it. even some members of the clintons' own party object. pardoning a fugitive from justice is wrong. rich fled the u.s. 17 years ago rather than face charges of tax evasion, mail fraud, racketeering and dealing with iran during the trade embargo. mr. clinton acted after receiving personal appeals from denise rich and former white house lawyer jack quinn, who argued the charges were too severe. quinn made a strong case and i was convinced he was right on the merits. the former president apparently never consulted federal prosecutors. margaret love reviewed pardon requests at the justice department. it's more thaan appearance that access made the difference. i think there is not a question that access did, in fact, make a difference in this case. the clintons also are facing criticism for accepting a last-minute rush of gifts worth $190,000, including tables and chairs from denise rich. sources say a california friend, rita pynos, encouraged some donors to move fast before senator clinton would have been unable to accept the gifts. so mrs. clinton begins her term, mr. clinton ends his in a familiar place, the center of controversy. jackie judd, abc news, washington.

Anti-globalization protestors are staging a counter conference to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. Non-governmental organizations are setting up a series of rival events highlighting the negative impact of globalization. From Davos, Claire Dool reports. Whether on the streets or in the conference halls, opponents of globalization are determined to make their voices heard in Davos. A group of NGOs has set up a rival event to the World Economic Forum. They accuse the Forum of being undemocratic, unaccountable and of setting the global agenda behind closed doors. Both sides, the forum and the counter forum, accept that globalization has widened the gaps between rich and poor. Claire Dool, BBC News, Davos.

Judging from the mood in the streets of Davos, a Barak-Arafat meeting just might be friendlier than a lot of what goes on outside the Economic Forum. Swiss police and troops are mounting an unprecedented security operation to make sure anti-globalization protests don't get out of hand. The World's Stephen Beard reports. The people of Davos are by all accounts bemused. Last week the sleepy picturesque ski resort found itself lumped together with trouble spots like East Timor and Sierra Leone. The US State Department urged American citizens to stay away from Davos unless they are attending the World Economic Forum. The Swiss police are certainly expecting trouble. There are roadblocks on all routes into the area. The perimeter of the Convention Center is sealed off with barbed wire and local hotels have installed x-ray machines. Such precautions are inevitable says the Forum spokesman Chares McClaine, following the violence and vandalism at similar meetings in Seattle and Prague. I think that protests like this are frankly almost a fact of life now at International gatherings like this. Inevitably there are going to be some protestors who are going to come and they are going to be in the streets. But we feel that what happens inside the Congress Center is probably going to be every bit as important as anything that would happen outside. Most of the protestors regard the Davos summit as the symbol of a system that has failed. Tony Juniper of Friends of the Earth says his group will stage a nonviolent demonstration at Davos against the damage that the free market philosophy has caused. Economic globalization is degrading the global environment, it's making rich people richer and it's marginalizing poor people to the extent that the human development report from the United Nations a couple of years ago shows how the gap between rich and poor is still growing despite a massive increase in global wealth. The protestors claim that violence tends to erupt at these events because of heavy handed policing and because the demonstrators are prevented from having a dialog with people attending the forum. That's nonsense, says forum organizer Cloudz Magia. He claims that many different points of view are represented inside the summit. We have been extending invitation right, left and center, but the people who are in the street they are not interested in dialog. They are interested in grabbing the attention of the media to be part of the news show. This year's protestors in Davos also have a novel and nonviolent way of getting their views across to the forum. Thanks to a special Internet project they can send a short message that will be beamed by laser in letters 15 yards high onto the side of a mountain not far from the Convention Center. Delegates, however, are likely to be preoccupied with other matters like the prospects for the global economy now that the US is slowing down. Canadian Finance Minister Paul Martin is bullish. Certainly most economists feel that there will be a slowing down. In fact they want that slowing down in order to make sure that we've got the long-term vote. But they do not believe that there will be a recession, that really that any downturn will be of relatively short duration. And that appears to be the prevailing view among the delegates at Davos this week. Most feel that a gentle slowdown in the global economy will be swiftly followed by an upturn. For The World I'm Stephen Beard in London.

This is The World. I am Tony Kahn. Today in Beijing, Chinese followers of the Falun Gong spiritual movement defied a government ban and staged sporadic demonstrations in Tianianmen Square. Beijing's crackdown on Falun Gong was stepped up a notch on Tuesday after five protestors publicly set themselves on fire. In its first official comment on human rights in China, the Bush administration expressed its displeasure at the Chinese crackdown. Yesterday State Department spokesman, Richard Boucher called on China to release all religious and political practitioners. And now the Chinese authorities have expressed their displeasure. The World's Clark Boyd has our story. China was unambiguous today in its response to the Bush administration's criticism of Beijing's crackdown on Falun Gong. Foreign Ministry spokesman, Jubang Jao said China demands that the US government respect our stand on the Falun Gong issue and stop interfering in China's internal affairs. The Washington Director of Human Rights Watch for Asia, Mike Chendresic says that with the new administration in Washington, both Chinese President Jiang Zemin and President George W Bush see this as an important time to play to their domestic audiences. Jiang Zemin has a party congress coming up next year. He has to appear to be tough with the new Bush administration, while at the same time encourage and continue trade investment and economic engagement. Bush, on the other hand, has members of his own Republican Party, who want him to take a tougher line, especially on human rights and religious freedom. The controversy surrounding Falun Gong goes right to the heart of one of the biggest issues between China and the United States, human rights. For their part the Chinese government insist that Falun Gong is a dangerous cult, while the United States says that its practitioners have a right to self-expression. But Mike Chendresic of Human Rights Watch thinks that the Falun Gong issue won't derail Sino-US relations. For the most part, both governments realize they have a mutual interest in maintaining overall good political and economic relations. It's a question of balancing those overall interests with specific concerns that continue to divide the two governments or at least provoke real tension. Just how much tension will become evident later this year when the Unites States will decide whether to support a UN resolution condemning China for human rights abuses. For The World this is Clark Boyd.

Want another advantage of hydrogen over oil? Well, when is the last time you heard of a hydrogen spill threatening a sensitive ecosystem? Today more than a week after a tanker spilled a 180 thousand gallons of oil near the Galapagos Islands, experts are warning that it could take several days to drag the ship away. And the tanker's captain now faces charges that could land him up to 5 years in prison. The BBC's Tim Hersh reports from one of the Ecuadorian Islands. The captain of the Jessica Tokinio Arivalo is being held at the port authority building on San Kristobal which looks directly out to the stricken tanker still stranded on a reef after running aground nine days ago. Mr. Arivala said he had mistaken a channel marker at the entrance to the harbor for a lighthouse. He spoke of his horror as the vessel ran aground and he realized his mistake. In that moment I felt like it was right up to me to die. I know what's happening now. But that time I didn't know. I had nine nights, nine days, not eating nor sleeping. I feel sick because I don't feel guilty for that. Formal proceedings are now underway to prosecute Mr. Arivalo and the owners of the Jessica. An official from the Ecuadorian prosecuting authorities Alfrado Alvea arrived on the island to announce the start of legal action. The owners of the boat, the captain, the crew, they will send you, all the persons who've made that damage, up to five years to the jail and pay all the damage they have cost. Out in the harbor preparations are being made to attach cables to the tanker so that it can be floated and towed out to sea, where it's expected to be sunk. Edwin Stanton of the United States Coastguard says the rough sea conditions have helped to reduce the environmental damage from the oil spill. Paradoxically, the surf that's washing over the boat and causing damage to the vessel has been mixing the diesel with the heavy oil and allowing both to evaporate and mix into the water very well. So Mother Nature give us and Mother Nature take it away. No major oil concentrations have been sighted recently more than 6-10 miles Northwest of the source of the vessel. So much of it is naturally dissipating and evaporating. We are very lucky in that. But conservation scientists are still very concerned about small amounts of oil which have washed up on beaches up to 80 kilometers away, possibly threatening creatures, including Galapagos' sea turtles. Ecological disaster may have been averted, but the wildlife is not completely safe yet. The BBC's Tim Hersh reporting from the Galapagos Island of San Kristobal.

A moderate earthquake rattled southern Pakistan and northwestern India on Friday, shaking buildings for more than a minute and sending people into the streets in fear. At least two people died in Pakistan. Rescuers sifting through the rubble of a collapsed two-story house in the Sindh city of Hyderabad in Pakistan found the bodies of a child and an adult, and were searching for more victims. The identities of the victims were not given. The quake had a preliminary magnitude of 5.5, said Arif Mahmood, a meteorologist in Karachi, Pakistan. The location of the epicenter was not immediately known. The 8:50 a.m. quake was also felt in the Indian capital of New Delhi, and in Bombay, India's financial and entertainment capital, 700 miles to the south. Millions of Hindu pilgrims sleeping in tents at the Kumbh Mela festival in eastern Uttar Pradesh, 930 miles east of Karachi, felt the ground sway beneath them, but there were no reports of panic. Residents of India's arid western states of Rajasthan and Gujarat rushed out of their homes, but then returned when the shaking stopped. The quake hit New Delhi, a city of 12 million people, just before India's massive Republic Day parade for which thousands of soldiers and police had been put on alert against any possible terrorist attack.

A strong earthquake rocked Pakistan and India on Friday, knocking over buildings and houses, and killing at least 20 people, officials said. Rescuers pulled 18 bodies from the rubble of two collapsed buildings in the Indian city of Surat, 580 miles west of New Delhi, Assistant Commissioner of Police M.B. Tethani said by telephone from Surat. He said the death toll from the 6.9-magnitude quake could climb as the rubble is cleared. In Hyderabad in Pakistan's Sindh region, emergency crews sifting through the wreckage of a fallen two-story house found the bodies of a child and an adult, and were searching for more victims. The identities of the victims were not given. The Indian Meteorological Institute put the quake's magnitude at 6.9 and said it was centered in the Rann of Kutch desert plateau on the border between India and Pakistan, about 190 miles southeast of the Pakistani capital of Karachi. Meteorologists in Pakistan had earlier said the quake had a preliminary magnitude of 5.5, and was centered 1,200 miles south of the city of Peshawar, Pakistan, under the Arabian Sea. The quake, which struck at 8:50 a.m., was felt in Bombay, India's financial and entertainment capital, where residents fled tall buildings as pictures and cupboards shook. It was the same in Madras, on the eastern coast of India and in Pondicherry, further to the south, where officials with loudspeakers urged panicked residents to be calm. Millions of Hindu pilgrims sleeping in tents at India's Kumbh Mela festival in eastern Uttar Pradesh, 930 miles east of Karachi, felt the ground sway beneath them, but there were no reports of panic. Residents of India's arid western states of Rajasthan and Gujarat rushed out of their homes, but then returned when the shaking stopped. The quake hit New Delhi, a city of 12 million people, just before India's massive Republic Day parade. No panic was reported at the parade site, which was to be attended by India's top government and military leaders.

A devastating earthquake struck the western state of Gujarat Friday, then shook the rest of the Indian subcontinent from top to bottom. More than 650 people are confirmed dead, but officials said they expect the toll to rise much higher as rescue teams find more victims in the rubble. The earthquake _ the most intense in India in half a century _ rumbled across Gujarat Friday morning shortly before 9 a.m., collapsing thousands of simple homes in Bhuj, a city of 150,000 close to the earthquake's epicenter, and toppling dozens of high-rise buildings and multistory apartments to the east in Ahmedabad, the state's commercial heart. Indian authorities said the earthquake had a magnitude of 6.9, the strongest here since 1950, while French, Chinese and U.S. seismologists put the magnitude between 7.6 and 7.9. The Indian air force on Friday began to airlift blankets, tents, medical supplies and doctors to Bhuj and Ahmedabad, as well as bulldozers, cranes and other heavy equipment that can help get people out of buildings that have tumbled down. And the army is moving about 3,750 troops into the worst hit areas to set up shelters and aid in the rescue efforts. ``We have decided to meet the emergency on a war footing,'' Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee said here in the capital. ``The states which are affected will be given every assistance by the center. This is the time for the people to rally around and fight this calamity which has struck us.'' When the earth began to move Friday morning in Gujarat, more people than usual were at home because it was Republic Day, a national holiday that celebrates the adoption of the Indian constitution. Many of them were preparing to gather around their televisions to watch the parade in New Delhi that is the nation's annual show of military might. Afterward, people poured into the streets in terror, fearing they would be buried beneath their own roofs, and more than a dozen aftershocks kept them outside in the chill air Friday night, some of them huddled around bonfires. Temperatures were expected to drop into the 40s. ``Many people are still on the roads out of panic,'' Manorama Bhagat, an official in the district magistrate's office in Ahmedabad, said in a telephone interview. ``They are frightened to go back in their houses out of fear of repeat tremors.'' Bhuj, near the western coast of Gujarat and India's northern border with Pakistan, was the hardest hit city, but it was impossible to know the full extent of casualties because the city's communication links were completely severed in the earthquake. Officials said after an aerial survey that 10 percent of the homes there had collapsed and the other 90 percent were damaged. As of Friday night, Ahmedabad, a city of about 5 million people, had the largest number of confirmed dead. Bhagat said 247 bodies had been recovered from collapsed buildings there. Dozens of multistory buildings, many of them constructed in the last few years, fell down. (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) The city's hospitals were scenes of confusion and heartbreak. ``In some hospitals the injured could not be immediately treated for the paucity of facilities and staff,'' the Press Trust of India news agency reported. ``Several victims, most of them women and children, with their skulls broken, limbs and backs badly bruised, awaited immediate attention at the same time.'' (END OPTIONAL TRIM) But cities and towns across the state of Gujarat reported deaths. And India's home minister, Lal Krishna Advani, who represents the state in Parliament, told reporters in Ahmedabad that the number of dead could be 1,000 or more. Late Friday, the Press Trust of India, citing unnamed official sources, reported that more than 1,500 were dead, including as many as 1,000 people in Bhuj. While the deadly impact of the earthquake was concentrated in Gujarat, the tremors were felt from Katmandu, Nepal, westward to Karachi, Pakistan, and south to Madras in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu. Here in New Delhi, lamp shades swayed and chairs shook on Friday morning. Pakistan and India are not talking to each other these days about trying to make peace in the contested region of Kashmir, but Pakistan's military ruler, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, took the earthquake as an occasion to send a message of condolence to Vajpayee. ``I have been saddened by the tragic loss of life and property in the earthquake which hit parts of India today,'' the general wrote in the message, released in Islamabad, Pakistan.

The colorful Arnaud Clement didn't shake a fist or crack a smile, much less fling his shirt, shoes and socks into the seats. And, yet, he had every reason to celebrate with his usual flair. Clement had just pulled off an unfathomable comeback by slaying two match points halfway through a captivating four-hour semifinal at the Australian Open on Friday night. At 5-foot-8-inches tall, he had just scampered to every drop volley, covered all corners of the court and made winners appear like trick quarters plucked from behind an ear. All of this on his way to making up a two-sets-to-none deficit. ``A small miracle,'' Clement called it. But on his fifth match point in the last grueling game of the night, as a weary Sebastien Grosjean smacked a forehand into the net, Clement just glanced at the players box, dropped his head and walked slowly to the net after his 5-7, 2-6, 7-6 (4), 7-5, 6-2 resurrection. This was his first trip to the final of a major _ where he'll face defending champion Andre Agassi on Sunday _ but Clement didn't like the means to the glorious end. He was the first Frenchman to reach a final of the Australian Open since Jean Borotra won it in 1928. It wasn't a joyride going through his fellow Frenchman, his hitting partner and the friend he'd dined with for so many nights on the road. On Friday night, Clement left Grosjean crestfallen in the biggest match of their career. Still, the friendship endured. ``When Sebastien shook hands, he just said to me, `Go ahead and do your best, go to the end,''' Clement said. To end his wild two-week run with his first major title, Clement will have to be at his counter-punching best against the methodical and fit Agassi. Clement won't be the favorite, but he will have a chance. Two years ago, he was within two points of beating Agassi at the French Open. And last year, although Agassi was visibly distracted by a difficult family situation at the U.S. Open, he was eliminated by Clement in the second round. ``It will depend on how fit Andre really is himself,'' said Clement. ``As far as I'm concerned, I'm fairly confident against him.'' Beneath the retractable roof of Rod Laver Arena, closed to keep out the rain, 15th-seeded Clement revealed his sanguine nature against the 16th-seeded Grosjean. In the ninth and 10th games of the third set, Grosjean had Clement pushed up against the exit sign. With Clement serving at 3-5, Grosjean was poised to snap up his first match point of the day. But a daring Clement pulled Grosjean wide with a forehand into the corner, then wrong-footed him by whipping another blast behind him. He ended up saving his serve. Grosjean was still in prime position. He served for the match, and found his way to match point No. 2 at 40-30. But after a timid second serve, the 23-year-old Clement started a rally, came to the net on a short ball and punched a forehand volley for a winner. Suddenly, the 22-year-old Grosjean was visibly tight. Beneath his backward cap, his face looked panic-stricken. He ended up losing his serve with a forehand into the net on break point. Quickly, the death-defying Clement finished off a three-game run by taking the tiebreaker. ``I think I started well, but Arnaud keep fighting,'' Grosjean said. ``He started to play better. It was good fighting. But he came back and he played better at the end. ``I had a chance, of course. I think I'm not losing the match. He played better and better. I was, you know, thinking of the many break points.'' Of the 20 break points he had, Grosjean converted only 6 of them. A more opportune Clement converted 6 of 12. On paper, Grosjean played the better match. He had 78 unforced errors to 71 winners, while Clement committed 70 unforced errors to just 40 winners. Grosjean wielded the big serve (20 aces), while Clement served the same number of double faults as Grosjean (5) but ripped only 8 aces. Grosjean even won more total points (176-174). Timing made all the difference. On cue, Clement managed to combine desperation and nerve. In the 11th game of the fourth set, Clement watched a break point on Grosjean's serve evaporate when he scrambled to dig out a drop shot, lofted it over Grosjean's head only to watch his friend chase it down, spin around and hit a forehand passing shot down the line. Instead of a letdown, Clement kept his head up. By prolonging each rally with his speed _ using the same scrambling tactic that helped him upset the fifth-seeded Yevgeny Kafelnikov two nights before _ Clement forced Grosjean to go for every line. Finally, Grosjean snapped. Clement gobbled up his next break point chance when Grosjean cracked a forehand a hair wide of the line. After taking the fourth set, Clement barged through the fifth. He was ahead 5-2 before Grosjean's pride prodded him. Although deflated, Grosjean made Clement earn his victory. A suddenly aggressive Grosjean erased four match points before Clement prevailed on his fifth. Clement did what Grosjean couldn't. ``He could have finished off the match when he had his match points in the third set,'' Clement said. ``He didn't take advantage of it.'' Once he failed to close out the match in the third set, the life slowly drained out of Grosjean's groundstrokes. In the long and winding rallies between the two baseline players early in the match, Grosjean's patience was rewarded with the overzealous mistakes made by Clement. Then, everything flip-flopped. After saving the match, Clement was energized by his brush with doom. Grosjean's footwork soon fizzled. ``It was tough, you know, because I had a chance,'' Grosjean said. ``He started to play much better. I was tired. He started to think on his victory.'' Two nights before, Clement played to the fans at Rod Laver Arena by stripping to his shorts after upsetting Kafelnikov. Friday night, he didn't feel like celebrating at all. ``Yes, that's right,'' Clement said. ``Grosjean is my friend. It's my friendship with Grosjean.'' That was more important than making history. After their match, the two did as they always do: they went out to dinner together.

good evening. the earth opened up and the ground shook for two terrify terrifyingly long minutes. a powerful earthquake in northwest india. 7.9 on the richter scale. killed more than 2000 people today. mostly in the indian city. as so often happens, people in older buildings were more likely to escape harm than those in newer ones. tonight, rescuers are racing to find more people they believe are still buried in the rubble. many survivors have no choice but to sleep in the streets. here's abc's ned potter. tonight in the quake zone, the air was filled with sirens. workers tried to move rubble -- and often failed. we still have two people who are alive here. we are trying to get them out. it happened to be a holiday today -- 51 years since india became a republic. and in all those years, the country has never had an earthquake this intense. "we are really suffering," said this man. "such big slabs have fallen down. the whole house has fallen apart." that was common. this four-story apartment building, only three years old, collapsed with more than 30 people inside. the epicenter was in a dry, desert region, but it includes the city of ahmadabad, with more than 4 million people. bbc correspondent mike woolridge was one of the first western reporters there. tonight, in the rubble of buildings like this, the attempt to rescue trapped victims is becoming increasingly desperate as the hours pass. india's prone to earthquakes, but this one was unusual. it was felt as far away as pakistan, nepal and bangladesh -- some of these places more than 1,000 miles away. that's because today's disaster area has not had a lot of quakes, so the rock below has not been split by fault lines. when a quake does happen, the whole region shakes. the seismic energy, the vibrations created by the earthquake, travel very efficiently, and they're felt far away. in ipd ya tonight, rescue teams are having terrible trouble reaching the area. and the death tl, clearly in the thousands, may never be fully known. ned potter, abc news, new york.

good evening. it's now early saturday morning in india and in the western part of that heavily populated country, a disaster of historic proportions. a massive earthquake, 7.9 on the richter scale, and the death toll could end up in the many thousands. the killer quake shook a wide area for a full 45 seconds. it was felt as far north as nepal and in the epicenter, the damage was calamitous. nbc's ron allen from london tonight. the situation in india grows more grim each hour -- at least 2,000 dead, 3,000 injured, and now a desperate race to save thousands buried under the rubble. earlier today, a baby found alive. among the missing, 70 young students and teachers believed buried under their school. outside, a four-story apartment building, a search for up to 50 residents, perhaps still alive inside. the ground started shaking. i told everyone to get out, but many people didn't make it. the injured overwhelm some hospitals with reports of victims dying while waiting for help. the massive quake strikes at 8:46 a.m. many families still at home celebrating a national holiday. a quake measuring 7.9 on the richter scale lasting some 45 seconds. the epicenter -- gujarat, india's seventh largest state, home to 41 million people, an industrial center with major ports, pipelines and textile center. there's some american investment in the state as well. reports of buildings swaying, the ground shaking more than 1,000 miles away, in four countries, including neighboring pakistan where two children died when their house collapsed. throughout the day, fear and panic spreading, as more than 80 aftershocks hit the quake zone, and scientists expect more strong aftershocks to follow. magnitude 6 would not be a surprise, and that would be a danger to the rescue teams. already, hundreds of buildings collapsed, power stations, phone lines and water service knocked out. tonight, offers of help from around the world, including the u.s., but india's leaders still trying to figure out what's needed most. india's army, trying to spearhead rescue and relief operations, off to a slow start with little heavy equipment to move rubble. flights carrying 10,000 tents, tons of food, now on the way. tonight, india's leaders calling on their citizens to pull together and warning it may be several days before the country fully knows the toll of death and destruction. ron allen, nbc news, london.

nbc news "in depth" tonight. of earthquakes, which we've seen so graphically tonight in india. of course, here in california, earthquakes are pretty common, including some of the biggest ever. over the past two centuries, an estimated 4,000 people have died in quakes in this country, 3,000 in one quake alone -- san francisco, 1906. so can experts predict the risk, and can they forecast where a big one may strike? our "in depth" report tonight from nbc's robert hager. 20 minutes before the huge quake in india, a minor one struck the u.s. under ohio's lake erie shoreline. it woke me up, and i jumped up and sat on the side of the bed. i felt this rumble coming and pretty soon everything was shaking. last week, two other tremors rattled neighborhoods of new york. in fact, there are 12,000 quakes a year, worldwide -- most minor. but big ones, like india's, unleash energy equal to thousands of atom bombs. by the time you move on to a magnitude 9 like the 1960 alaskan earthquake, the total energy output is probably starting to approach all the nuclear warheads in the world. that's a lot. in this nasa illustration, each yellow dot represents an earthquake in recent decades. it's easy to see how they concentrate along fault lines that correspond to the edges of the big plates that form the earth's outer crust. you hear a lot about earthquake fault lines, and maybe you imagine a deep chasm in the earth or an open split, well, this is what one looks like. in fact, this is america's best-known fault line, the san andreas fault, which runs all the way from the mexican border through california, nearly up to the oregon line. another view of a fault -- a tiny crack in pavement, outside san francisco. sure sign of movement below, says the geological survey's david schwartz. at this point, about four millimeters a year, but over time, that builds up and when a large earthquake occurs, it'll go boom, maybe move six feet in one shot. the sort of movement that's caused history's "big ones" in the lower 48, and where the risks are still greatest today, mostly concentrated in the west, but devastating quakes in the 1800s in new madrid, missouri, and charleston, south carolina. scientists use so-called shake tables to see what could happen if earthquakes like these struck today. what it takes to bring a building down and apply designs to make structures more flexible, so they'll sway with a quake but remain intact. lucy jones. the most dangerous thing in an earthquake is human construction. earthquakes don't kill people, buildings do. but unlike hurricanes, which forecasters can see coming, or even volcanoes, which often belch smoke before erupting, an earthquake signals no warning. the ability to predict the timing of a strike is none existent. we don't know when it's gonna happen. you know, the solid earth comes up upon you, and you don't know when, and you don't know if you're gonna be with your family. and we feel out of control. and out of control tonight in india as the death toll mounts. scientists can only wonder where and when the next big one will hit. robert hager, nbc news, washington.

Joseph Kabila, the young and little-known son of Laurent Kabila, was sworn in as president of this war-divided Central African nation on Friday, 10 days after his father's assassination. Government and military officials, traditional leaders and other dignitaries looked on at Congo's former parliament building as Joseph Kabila pledged to unite and defend a country that has been ravaged by corrupt leadership and 2 1/2 years of civil war. ``I solemnly commit to respect the constitution and the laws of the republic, to guarantee the independence, unity and the cohesion of the Congolese people, as well as the integrity of the national territory,'' Kabila said in French, as he stood in a dark pinstriped suit near a 10-foot-high portrait of his father. The Supreme Court confirmed the younger Kabila as the fourth president since independence from Belgium in 1960 amid heavy security at the Palace of the Nation _ the same hall where Laurent Kabila's body was laid to rest Tuesday inside a marble mausoleum. Court President Lwonge Kabinda Ngoy spoke at length about Joseph Kabila's family history, declaring that he was born in 1971 to Laurent Kabila and ``a Congolese woman.'' Earlier, it was reported he was born in 1972. Raised in Tanzania and Uganda, the younger Kabila remains a mystery to most people in Congo, who aren't even certain of his age. In the streets of Kinshasa, there is deep distrust of the young leader's background, with many convinced that his mother is a Tutsi, the dominant ethnic group in the country's hated neighbor, Rwanda. Many waited anxiously Friday for Joseph Kabila's first address to the nation, which was expected to be broadcast in the evening on state-run television and radio. ``We have never heard him speak. We want to hear his program,'' said Robert Disashi, a traditional leader in a dark blue suit and leopard tooth necklace, as he arrived for the ceremony. ``We aspire for nothing but peace.'' Laurent Kabila's inner circle was quick to fill the power vacuum after the former president was gunned down by one of his own bodyguards, but has since fretted over legal details of succession in the troubled country that has never enjoyed a peaceful transfer of power. Initially scheduled for Wednesday, the inauguration was delayed once to allow the slain Kabila's hand-picked parliament to approve his son's ascension, and once again to give the Supreme Court time to craft the oath of office. Laurent Kabila suspended the country's constitution when he toppled the late Mobutu Sese Seko in 1997, leaving no blueprint for a handover of power. The selection of the young Joseph Kabila was met with widespread fears that a figurehead had been chosen, leaving little hope for an end to the civil war and a revival of the shattered economy. But some foreign officials view the death of Laurent Kabila, who continued Mobutu's corrupt and self-serving policies, as a sudden opportunity for peace. Louis Michel, foreign minister of former colonial ruler Belgium, launched a tour of the region after Kabila's funeral, urging Congo's warring parties to seize the moment and enter a dialogue to end the war. After meeting Rwandan President Paul Kagame in Kigali on Thursday, Michel called the sudden power transfer ``a new element, which can justify a new space to discuss ... peace.'' Joseph Kabila told U.N. special representative Kamel Morjaneon on Thursday he is open to new peace talks and eventual democratic elections in Congo. But he added ``this will not be possible as long as foreign troops occupied part of his territory,'' U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said at the world body's headquarters in New York. The main rebel group said Friday from Brussels, Belgium that it too was ready to talk, urging a meeting of the warring parties within 30 days. ``The solution is political,'' said Kin-Kiey Mulumba, spokesman of the Rwanda-backed Congolese Rally for Democracy. ``We cannot find a solution by war.'' Congo's civil war began in August 1998 when Laurent Kabila's main sponsors, Uganda and Rwanda, turned against him and began supporting an anti-government rebellion. He held onto power and kept the rebels at bay with the help of new allies Angola, Zimbabwe and Namibia, who have pledged to keep their forces in Congo to defend Kabila's son.

President Bush plans to speak at the policy retreats to be held by House and Senate Democrats next week, an unusual act of interparty cooperation after eight years of acidic relations between the parties, White House and congressional aides said Friday. Former President Clinton regularly attended Democratic strategy sessions, where party leaders crafted plans for outflanking Republicans in Congress. But Clinton was not invited to similar gatherings of Republicans and never offered to attend them. But even as he extended this symbolic political olive branch, Bush made clear his continuing opposition not only to abortion but to research using tissue from aborted fetuses. Bush told reporters that federal money should not be used for research on stem cells from aborted fetuses. His stance is opposed by many medical researchers, who say that blocking federal research money could hamper research into Alzheimer's, spinal cord injuries and other serious disorders. Scientists extract stem cells from aborted fetuses and embryos left over from fertility clinics. Some can also be found in adult tissues but scientists say the fetal and embryonic cells are most usable. ``I believe there's some wonderful opportunities for adult stem-cell research,'' Bush said in response to a reporter's question. ``I believe we can find stem cells from fetuses that died a natural death, but I do not support research from aborted fetuses.'' In one of his first officials acts on Monday, Bush ordered a halt to federal payments to international organizations that support abortions or abortion counseling overseas. The action sparked protests from lawmakers and groups that support abortion rights. Despite his willingness to confront such a contentious issue, Bush says he is eager to change the partisan tone of Washington and do everything he can to quickly establish positive ties to Congress. Whether the partisan divisions of recent years can be bridged, or even temporarily papered over, remains to be seen. ``The people _ some people _ take a look at the election and say, `Well, gosh, the country is too divided, nothing will happen,''' Bush said at the start of a meeting with first-term lawmakers Friday. ``Our mission is to prove them wrong. It's to not only restore faith in government by results, positive results for the people, but also to restore faith in government by how we behave, by how we conduct the people's business.'' This week, he invited a total of 90 lawmakers to the White House for small-group meetings. Twenty-nine of them were Democrats. Friday, after having lunch with a bipartisan group of newly elected members of Congress, Bush also met with 17 governors, both Democrats and Republicans. Aides to Sen. Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the minority leader, said they invited Bush on Wednesday to address the Democratic caucus, which will meet in Washington on Feb. 2. ``We all want to work together and we thought it would be productive for him to come talk to the caucus,'' said Ranit Schmelzer, Daschle's spokeswoman. A White House official contacted the office of Rep. Dick Gephardt, the House minority leader, to determine whether House Democrats would also welcome Bush's attendance at their retreat, which will be in Farmington, Pa., next weekend. House Democrats accepted the offer. ``It can't hurt,'' said a House Democratic leadership aide. ``We have pretty healthy skepticism of Republicans in Congress but at this stage we take him at his word that we wants to work with us.'' Bush Friday also brushed off reports that outgoing Clinton aides had engaged in pranks and vandalism as they departed the White House complex. ``There may have been a prank or two, maybe somebody put a cartoon on the wall, but it's time now to move forward,'' Bush said after the meeting with governors. One of the last Clinton aides to leave the White House on Inauguration Day said he had apologized to the Bush administration for any improper acts by departing staffers. But he said he found only a single malicious act during his inspection of the complex. ``We tried to make this the most cordial transition in history,'' said Mark F. Lindsay, who oversaw the office of management and administration in Clinton's second term. ``When I heard these reports I called my counterpart in the Bush White House and said if you guys find anything like this I apologize. But I was there. All I saw was that some people didn't clean up that well.'' In recent days, Bush aides have said that they found the ``W'' keys removed from their keyboards, file drawers glued shut and posters that poked fun at the president's mangled syntax: ``Office of Strategerie'' and ``Office of Subliminable Cyber Space.'' Even more serious, however, have been the accusations of cut telephone lines and stolen mementos from Air Force One. Lindsay said he walked through the White House and Old Executive Office Building in the closing hours of Clinton's presidency last Saturday and found messy but unmolested offices. ``A couple people may have let their emotions get the best of them, but if there were problems, they were very isolated,'' he said, noting that there are some 5,000 people _ a mixture of political and career workers _ with access to the White House. Lindsay said he reported to the Secret Service one act of vandalism: Someone had pried a presidential seal off of a plaque hanging on the wall in the office building adjacent to the White House. Ari Fleischer, the president's press secretary, said a presidential aide was ``keeping track in his head of the different things that people have said took place to their desks or offices.'' But Fleischer added: ``As far as we're concerned, it's over.'' But some former aides to Clinton were angry about all the anonymous reports of damage by Bush aides, which they considered overblown. A Clinton aide, who spoke on the condition he not be identified, said he had spoken to former colleagues and was compiling a list of some of the acts that aides to Bush's father performed eight years ago when they left the White House. ``There were upturned desks,'' the official said. ``There were signs that said, `Draft Dodger.' There were lamps glued to desks and headsets glued to phones. They even hung a banner that said `We'll be back in four years,' which as it turns out was off by a factor of two.''

Peter Kothari began early Friday morning trying to call relatives in India to learn whether they all were safe from the devastating earthquake that killed more than 2,000 people. ``The first thing they said was, 'We are OK,''' he said. ``That was the major thing I wanted to hear.'' Several Indian cultural groups and associations in the United States began organizing relief efforts Friday to aid the quake-stricken area. Kothari, who is president of the Indo-American Cultural Association, was to fly Friday night to India. Once just a family visit, his trip will now be spent helping coordinate aid efforts. ``We are fearing thousands and thousands to be dead and injured,'' he said. ``At this moment we are trying to figure out what we can do and what we should do.'' President Bush offered condolences to the victims and said the United States is willing to provide assistance ``as needed and desired by the governments'' of both India and Pakistan. As an initial donation, the U.S. ambassador to India, Richard Celeste, is able to provide $25,000 from a fund to be used in emergency situations. Providian Financial Corp. in San Francisco donated $10,000 to relief efforts. The chairman and CEO of the credit card company, Shailesh Mehta, is from Mumbai, India, and has family there. ``Hopefully our small gesture will start momentum,'' he said in an interview later. Jeevan Zutshi, an engineer and real estate developer who heads the Indo-American Community Foundation in Fremont, Calif., said his organization of more than 500 people is prepared to give aid and resources to the quake victims as soon as possible. ``The community has really gone gung-ho in sending support,'' he said. ``We will be doing all the things that have to be done.'' In Albany, N.Y., Dr. Maninder Gujral said the Sikh community in the area would likely mount a relief effort. ``The infrastructure there is not that strong,'' Gujral said. ``Something like this, you're not going to be able to get through.'' The Asian American Hotel Owners Association, headquarters in Atlanta, is asking members to send donations to the American Red Cross, which has launched relief efforts in the Gujarat state, where the quake was centered. The nonprofit organization has nearly 7,000 members in the U.S. and Canada, according to office coordinator Faye Jacobson. ``Many of our members come from Gujarat or have family there,'' she said Friday night. ___ On the Net: State Department Emergency Services to U.S. Citizens Abroad: http://travel.state.gov/where.html Red Cross: http://www.redcross.org

Dusty, red-eyed survivors scoured the rubble of buildings that collapsed like stacks of cards in India's powerful earthquake, searching for loved ones Saturday, as officials predicted as many as 6,000 may have been killed. The 7.9 magnitude quake killed 2,315 people and injured 14,000 in western Gujarat state, close to the Pakistani border, according to the state government's confirmed count. The total includes 10 people killed in collapsed houses in Pakistan. Friday's quake, the strongest to hit the subcontinent in 50 years, shook high-rise towers 600 miles away in the capital, New Delhi. It could be felt as far as 1,200 miles away in Calcutta and coastal Bangladesh _ a distance about equivalent to that between Washington and Dallas. Many more bodies are believed buried in the rubble, and the death toll is likely to exceed 6,000, Gujarat's Home Minister Haren Pandya was quoted as telling United News of India. Aftershocks kept rattling the piles of debris, halting search efforts as people scattered in panic. A high-ranking Gujarati official said more than 7,500 people could have been killed. In Bhuj, a town 12 miles from the epicenter, some 10,000 people were still missing in the rubble, and at least half of those were thought dead, said the official, speaking on condition of anonymity at the emergency control room in Gandhinagar, the state's political capital. Bhuj, a desert town of 150,000 people, was the worst hit by the quake, with 1,400 people confirmed dead and 10,000 injured. Across Gujarat state, more than 100 multistory apartment buildings were toppled. In Ahmedabad, Gujarat's commercial capital and a sprawling city of 4.5 million, helmeted rescue workers used iron rods to pry slabs of concrete and metal, searching for survivors. Relatives stood atop buildings, collapsed into stacks, listening and peering into the crevices for signs of life. ``I am too distraught to talk, maybe later,'' said one man perched on a huge pile of massive stones, watching intently as rescue workers searched for his 14-year-old daughter. Some people crept up the twisted stairwells to pack valuables into suitcases and baskets, lowering them by rope to the ground. But most people were too afraid to re-enter the shaking buildings. They slept in the street around campfires with 55-degree temperatures overnight. ``We slept a little in the open. We were too afraid to sleep inside,'' said businessman Ramesh Patel. Hetal Shah, 23, and her brothers scrambled over a pile of stones and metal that used to be their fourth-floor apartment at the top of the building. They were looking for $4,350 worth of jewelry and clothing that had been gathered for her wedding next month. Another man pulled a beautiful China plate from the pile, and said softly, ``This was from my living room.'' The quake struck at 8:50 a.m. Friday (10:20 p.m. EST Thursday) as many cities were beginning celebrations for India's 51st Republic Day, which commemorates the adoption of the country's constitution. The tremors shook across much of the north and west of this vast nation of one billion people, and even extended to the mountains of Nepal, 1,000 miles north of the epicenter. ``Immediately we need 25,000 to 30,000 tents to set up camps for the homeless,'' Pandya said. ``That's our topmost priority in terms of survivors. All phone lines are down so satellite phones have been set up.'' In Bhuj, the main hospital was crammed with seriously injured people. Nearly 1,000 injured residents, most wrapped in blankets against the night chill, were camping outside the hospital waiting their turn. At least four planes carrying soldiers, paramedics, food, medicine and tents landed at Bhuj's Air Force base, said R.K. Dhingra, an air force spokesman in New Delhi. The government said it was flying 10,000 tents, 10,000 tons of grain, 20 doctors and surgeons, communications and seismology experts to Gujarat. In Ahmedabad late Friday, corpses were piled up on the verandah of the N.S. Hospital, while patients overflowing into the hallways wailed and screamed with broken limbs and bleeding wounds. Bruised and bleeding bodies were laid in rows, covered with blankets as relatives sat by mourning. ``The earthquake is a calamity of national magnitude,'' Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee said. ``We have decided to meet the emergency on a war footing. This is the time for people to rally around.'' Vajpayee made no appeal for international aid, saying those needs were being assessed. President Bush, the United Nations, and Pakistan's army ruler Gen. Pervez Musharraf sent condolences. Bush said the United States is willing to provide assistance if needed, and the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Assistance announced that it will send a five-member earthquake assessment team to India on Sunday. The quake was the most powerful to strike India since Aug. 15, 1950, when an 8.5 magnitude temblor killed 1,538 people in northeastern Assam state. Mahajan insisted that Friday's quake measured 6.9, according to a preliminary figure given by the Indian Meteorological Institute. However, the U.S. Geological Survey, taking an average of seismograph measurements from around the world, said it was 7.9. There were least 83 aftershocks, several measuring up to 5.6 magnitude, in the 10 hours after the quake, said the seismological department at the Bhaba Atomic Center. An apparent aftershock also hit Bangladesh, where hundreds of panicked residents flooded into the streets of Satkhira, on the border with India. Baijubahi, an Ahmedabad man who uses only one name, said his wife was killed in the earthquake and six members of his family were still trapped in their building. ``The police are trying to persuade me to go to the hospital for my wife's post-mortem,'' he said. ``I'm more concerned about the rest, who could have survived.'' In the town of Surat _ where police reported at least 31 dead _ three people were killed in a stampede at a diamond factory. When the quake hit, diamond workers in the three-story factory crowded into a narrow stairwell and tried to push their way to the only exit, said police official Vineet Gupta. Elsewhere in the country, the quake caused high-rise buildings to sway from New Delhi in the north, to Bombay in the west, and Madras in the south and Calcutta in the east, more than a thousand miles from the epicenter. In the desert state of Rajasthan, the eighth-century Jaisalmer Fort, a popular tourist attraction, was damaged. Some of the distinctive yellow stones supporting the gate fell and the walls developed cracks. Millions of Hindus at the world's largest religious gathering in Allahabad, in Uttar Pradesh, more than 1,000 miles east of the epicenter, felt the ground sway under them. No injuries were reported. India's financial capital, Bombay, was closed for the holiday. People were sleeping late or having breakfast when the skyscrapers began swaying. They rushed out onto the streets in their nightgowns as dogs barked and birds screeched.

As President Bush completed his first week in office, prominent Republicans and even many Democrats agree that he has presided over one of the most orderly and politically nimble White House transitions in at least 20 years. If the first days offer any clue, they say, Bush may avoid the kind of stumbles that disrupted the early days of past presidents and hobbled them as they tried to turn their campaign promises into action. Independent academics and analysts as well as politicians in both parties said Bush had carefully calibrated his legislative offering last week by introducing his education package in a way that made it palatable to many Democrats, even as he reassured conservatives by moving to prohibit federal aid to groups that counsel on abortion overseas. They said that Bush displayed a deft touch in stroking lawmakers, and that his aides have been surprisingly responsive to members of Congress at a time when previous administrations would still be skirmishing over office space. And this week, Bush will lay out a carefully planned agenda to help the neediest Americans through religious organizations. He also plans to unveil part of his prescription drug program. ``We were all raised by mothers who told us we had one chance to make a first impression,'' said Sen. Christopher J. Dodd, D-Conn., echoing many of his colleagues. ``The first few days are certainly encouraging. And a first impression can last you awhile.'' In an unexpected turn that was not of Bush's making, the new president was helped immensely on Thursday when Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve Board chairman, validated the thrust of his economic program in congressional testimony. ``Talk about a windfall, he got a gigantic break with Greenspan's testimony,'' said Sen. Joseph Biden., a D-Del. ``Why God is so good to Republicans is beyond me.'' Bush's success is partly the result of his aides' intensely examining previous transitions, scouring the historical record for gestures and timetables _ and even interviewing important players from past administrations. For all the respectful reviews, the new administration is barely in its infancy and its political execution has not been flawless. Bush's selection of former Sen. John Ashcroft as attorney general enraged Democrats and many interest groups, who criticized Ashcroft as too conservative. Though Ashcroft is expected to be confirmed, even many Republicans questioned why Bush picked a fight with Democrats still smarting from his excruciatingly close victory. ``There are missteps that will haunt him,'' said Richard B. Shenkman, a presidential historian. ``He campaigned as a uniter, not a divider, then he goes ahead with the Ashcroft nomination.'' And while Bush's move on his first full day in office to deny aid to overseas groups that provide abortion counseling was celebrated by conservatives, it distracted from his theme of the week, education. (One White House official said the move was deliberate, because if Bush had not acted ``there would have been a rising chorus from the right.'') Another reality, if no surprise, is that Bush has not tackled many of the most nettlesome issues. And with one ill-considered remark or misstep, the successful efforts by the president thus far could unravel. But when Bush did run into trouble by selecting Linda Chavez as labor secretary, he moved with dispatch to accept her withdrawal and selected Elaine L. Chao, who was swiftly confirmed by the Senate. Despite his misgivings, Shenkman said that over all this transition has been the smoothest since Ronald Reagan arrived here two decades ago. ``Hats off to George W.,'' he said. White House officials said they began painstaking preparations for the first two weeks of the new presidency immediately after New Year's and had a day-by-day plan in place by Jan. 8. In a demonstration of the importance Bush's aides placed on his debut, Karl Rove, the president's senior adviser, said that in December, the staff drafted detailed briefing books on the beginning of every administration since John F. Kennedy's. The books included such facts as how many members of Congress each president met with his first week in office, what time the president and his staff reported to work, when he took his first domestic and foreign trips and when he announced legislative initiatives. ``It's important to strike the right starting note,'' Rove said. ``Time is precious.'' White House officials said they were most impressed by Reagan's transition, and they met with several officials from that White House, including Edwin Meese III, who was the attorney general; Michael Deaver, Reagan's image adviser; and Richard Wirthlin, a pollster and strategist. While some experts said Bush had faced an even more difficult challenge than his predecessors because the five-week post-election stalemate limited the time he had to prepare _ a point the new administration has made time and again _ many others asserted that Bush actually benefited from the truncated timetable. That is because with the focus in the press on the electoral dispute, Bush and his advisers could work quietly behind the scenes assembling a staff. They were spared the fate of Bill Clinton and other incoming presidents who for months found that their deliberations were subjected to speculative, and often damaging, coverage. ``In a weird way, the transition following one of the most turbulent and contested elections in history just didn't draw the same level of media glare as either the Bush transition or the Reagan transition,'' said Ralph Reed, a Republican strategist who is close to the White House, referring to two of the president's predecessors. ``And that worked to the Bush team's benefit.'' team's benefit.'' White House officials said they were determined to move swiftly and boasted that they tied the record of President Franklin D. Roosevelt of having six cabinet appointees confirmed and sworn in on the first day. Officials also said that Andrew Card, the White House chief of staff, directed the staff to focus on the smaller touches, like the importance of returning telephone calls from senior staff members and members of Congress. They said he also set an example by incessantly writing thank-you cards to people with whom he met with the first week. This attention to detail impressed some lawmakers in this city of egos, who said they were pleased to get their calls returned by Card and other top officials who barely knew their new telephone numbers. ``A quick response on calls may not seem like a lot,'' Sen. Dodd said, ``but it is.'' Bush also placed significant emphasis on meeting with members of Congress. ``I guess the biggest, most pleasant surprise, if you'd call it that, was how receptive members of Congress are to come here to the White House to talk about how we can work together,'' Bush said on Friday. ``I think we've met with 90 members of Congress here in the first week.'' About a third of them were Democrats. White House officials and advisers said Bush would lay out proposals this week for helping the needy. On Monday, they said, he will announce the opening of an administration office to promote the further integration of faith-based organizations into federally financed social services. Officials have also discussed creating a presidential commission on the subject. Stephen Goldsmith, the former mayor of Indianapolis who was the Bush campaign's chief domestic policy adviser, will have a leading role in this broad effort, they said. As the week progresses, the officials said, Bush will meet at the White House with a variety of religious leaders and heads of not-for-profit charities. He is also expected to unveil proposals including changes in tax deductions that encourage people to give more money to religious and not-for-profit organizations. Aides said that Bush would also propose a part of his prescription drug program that deals with an immediate mechanism to get prescription drugs to poor Americans in the interim before there are changes in Medicare to make them available to everyone. By contrast, Clinton's transition eight years ago was especially sloppy. In his first days, he found himself mired in a firestorm over gays in the military, an issue that plagued his first term. He was also distracted by severe difficulties in settling on appointees, like an attorney general. A top aide to Clinton said of the new president: ``It's hard walking into the place on day one and pulling it off. They did a lot better than we did. It's pretty impressive.'' Four years before Clinton took office, President George Bush acknowledged at the end of his first week that there had been ``ripples'' of trouble. He was less aggressive than his son has been in pressing forward on an agenda. And there were flare-ups over how his administration planned to handle the savings and loan debacle, and over the abortion views of Bush's choice to run the department of health and human services, Dr. Louis W. Sullivan. John H. Sununu, the White House chief of staff at the time, said, ``Probably the most important thing we did not do well was that we could have had more discipline in the packaging of the message.'' In 1980, Ronald Reagan won plaudits for a relatively peaceful transition, but even he found himself under attack in the first week from conservatives who objected to his selection of appointees whom they did not deem sufficiently conservative, like Donald Regan as secretary of the treasury and Samuel Pierce Jr. as housing secretary. But in Reagan's first days, there was nothing like the turmoil of Jimmy Carter's debut, when there were huge public fights between the campaign staff and a separate operation designed to run the transition. ``Most White Houses are lucky if they get the furniture in,'' said Patrick Caddell, who was Carter's pollster. Referring to the Carter transition, he said: ``There was disarray. We were still learning. And Clinton blew it all in the first week. He drove his numbers to the ground in the immediate transition. George Bush and his people seem to know everybody. They all look like they've been in the same club before. So he's got momentum going for him.'' Most of all, politicians gave credit to Bush for surrounding himself with advisers and aides who have vast Washington experience, beginning with the vice president, Dick Cheney, who was chief of staff for former President Gerald Ford, a member of the House and, later, a secretary of defense. Card was a deputy chief of staff for Bush's father. ``President Bush has put together a pretty seasoned team around him _ if you add their years in Washington, you get a century's worth of experience,'' said Sen. Byron L. Dorgan, D-N.D. ``So his first few days in office have been largely free from controversy.'' Although Bush has benefited from seasoned Washington hands, White House aides said that the officials who had the largest role in stage-managing the agenda for his first days were Rove, who developed the central strategy, and Karen Hughes, Bush's counselor, who was responsible for message development. Robert M. Teeter, who ran the elder President Bush's transition, also praised the new president for skillfully playing on low expectations for his debut. ``If you go out and make a lot of overblown assertions about what you're going to do,'' Teeter said, ``you're just setting yourself up.''

President Bush stuck to popular themes of education and bipartisanship, sidestepped an abortion land mine, tinkered with his Oval Office decor and, aided by Democrats, closed out his critical first week wearing the blush of a honeymooner. ``Welcome to people's house!'' Bush gushed to the House freshmen he invited to lunch in the State Dining Room on Friday. ``Here we are in week one. I hope you're as enthused about your job as I am about mine.'' The Republican president who campaigned on a notion of working with Democrats gauged his running start a success based on its numbers: 11 meetings with more than 90 members of Congress (including 29 Democrats), a dozen Democratic party elders, and 17 governors, seven of them Democrats. Bush also chalked up 12 Senate votes confirming his Cabinet choices, exchanged courtesies by telephone with 12 foreign leaders, and eased into foreign policy by setting tete-a-tetes with heads of state from Mexico, Canada and Britain. On a lighthearted note, Bush, who has settled into a routine of getting to the Oval Office by 7 a.m. and working until around 6 p.m., reported that his pets were also adjusting. ``The cat that was howling on the first night is now more comfortable with her territory, so she's sleeping through the night,'' he chuckled. In his redecorated Oval Office, he ordered a watercolor of boy fishing replaced with a California landscape. Real problem issues simmered but did not erupt, allowing Bush to focus on the education proposals he sent to Congress on Tuesday. Two of Bush's biggest scores were serendipitous. Democratic Sen. Zell Miller of Georgia agreed to lend his name _ and a bipartisan boost _ to the president's $1.6 trillion plan for tax cuts. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan thrilled the White House by giving tax relief his own surprise blessing. First lady Laura Bush was a mostly silent partner, making no remarks when she and her husband visited a local school. The former librarian spoke up in a Roosevelt Room policy meeting with reading experts only after the president left, according to participants. Vice President Cheney was a more forceful presence, inaugurating offices on both the Senate and House sides of Capitol Hill, plus a weekly lunch with the president in his private dining room. Aides said Cheney sat in on Bush's every meeting, including the domestic policy and economic briefings he received each afternoon. Asked to assess the week, Bush said: ``I guess the biggest, most pleasant surprise, if you'd call it that, was how receptive members of Congress are to come here to the White House to talk about how we can work together ... figuring out if we can't exceed the expectations that now exist around the country that nothing's going to get done.'' Democrats who sat down with Bush were unanimous _ if not a bit grudging _ in grading him sincere. ``This fella is going about it as if he really believes he can make a difference,'' said Robert Strauss, a former Democratic Party chairman. ``He's had a reasonably sure-footed week. I think it probably surprised some people in town but he's always been blessed with being underestimated. It's a great thing when expectations are low.'' Rep. Ben Cardin, D-Md., observed that Bush seemed to be adjusting to the presidential weight now given to his every utterance and said several times in one Cabinet Room meeting, ``You know, I was just kidding.'' But Democrats were put on guard by two abortion-related pronouncements that bracketed the week and showed Bush rewarding anti-abortion conservatives at the core of his political operation while trying to appear middle-of-the-road. He used his first work day to ban U.S. foreign aid to family-planning groups that use private money to support abortion rights. There, the new White House showed an old hand's knack at spin control. Press secretary Ari Fleischer said the abortion order was not news, just the keeping of a campaign promise. Bush described his executive memorandum as keeping taxpayer money from paying for abortions. Family-planning activists, noting that U.S. funds are already so barred by statute, called his a specious argument designed to disguise the move as moderate. Before leaving for dinner Friday, Bush said federal money should not be used for research on fetal tissue or on stem cells derived from abortions. Bush left for another day _ ``in due time,'' as Secretary of State Colin Powell put it _ U.S.-Russia relations, which President Vladimir Putin warned are fragile because of Bush's pledge to build a missile defense system. With California's energy crisis threatening national impact, Bush extended by two weeks orders ensuring that the state gets power. He considered letting the state roll back its air pollution controls power plants. Bush made some catch-as-catch-can stabs at fixing his problem with black America, which voted against him by a 9-1 margin. He telephoned Rev. Jesse Jackson, had Washington's black mayor, Anthony Williams, over to lunch and visited a predominantly black school, where he promoted annual student testing. Bush agreed to look at election reform _ a ticklish area for him, given charges that his presidency was made possible by the disenfranchisement of black voters in Florida _ but only after Rep. David Bonior, D-Mich., raised the subject in one meeting. Rep. Albert Wynn, D-Md., a member of the Congressional Black Caucus, said the Bush team won a Week One honeymoon by starting with education. But Bush will not have such an easy going, Wynn predicted, when he turns this week to prescription drug aid for senior citizens, an issue where Republicans and Democrats have sharper differences.

Jennifer Capriati was seated in a small garden outside Rod Laver Arena late Saturday afternoon, at ease with the fuss around her, completely relaxed as the center of attention. She was just moments away from leaving the grounds for a photo session reserved for the Australian Open champion, and yet she was far removed from a time when she bristled at the flashbulbs that flooded the infancy of her career. In the early '90s, Capriati was simply ``Jenny'' to everyone. She giggled, twisted her hair and lit up every tournament she played in as the bubble-gum curiosity. Just after she won a gold medal in Barcelona, Spain, more than eight years ago, she said, ``All week I watched the other athletes up there, and I thought, `Wow, that would be so cool.''' A smitten public devoured the innocent reaction of the 16-year-old Capriati. For so long, nothing would ever top that moment for her. ``I was thinking about that,'' Capriati said on Saturday. ``I mean, that actually seems like another life. So this is a new life, a different life. It's actually like winning something for the first time again.'' She experienced a rebirth of sorts. As Capriati unraveled the plot of top-seeded Martina Hingis, 6-4, 6-3, in the final of the Australian Open, she found closure. If nothing else, she tied up one loose-ended question: will she ever be the same again? No, she is better. The 24-year-old Capriati is stronger, fitter and happier than she was when she turned pro 11 years ago. And more at peace with fame now than she was when she plunged into a dark adolescent period during the mid-90s. If the corporate world that once dumped her during her tailspin comes charging toward her again, a more mature Capriati seems poised to handle it this time around. ``I'm not going to let anything change me, change what I do or who I am,'' Capriati said. ``You know, I'm always going to do what I want. No matter how many companies or whatever comes at me, I'll just always stick to what makes me comfortable.'' Years ago, Capriati despised the constant corporate clawing of the tennis scene. In an attempt to escape, she dropped off the tour only to end up with her name in a police report after an arrest on misdemeanor marijuana possession in 1994. There were difficult times ahead, a stretch in her recovery that included drug rehabilitation. Throughout her most difficult times, Capriati received enough letters to understand how she has impacted others by not letting mistakes sabotage her life. ``I'm a little bit aware of it,'' Capriati said. ``If this helps somebody else, that's what I want. This is for them.'' On Saturday, the title to punctuate her circuitous comeback was for herself, also. But as she glanced at her father in the stands upon match point, Capriati seemed more pleased for the family that has stuck by her than for her own personal moment of glory. ``I'm a pretty critical person of myself,'' Capriati said. ``I want to remain humble because this has also come with the help of so many others.'' All alone on the court, Capriati fueled her own finish. She was the one who reached back and uncoiled a backhand blast on match point, sending a return whistling by a shell shocked Hingis. ``It was a winner down the line, but it was the slowest winner,'' Capriati said with a smile. ``It just kept, you know, going. I mean, as soon as I saw that it was clean, that I had done it, it really hit me. It was like, `Oh, my God.' I just jumped for joy. I mean that was it. I couldn't believe it just happened.'' In her own way, Hingis shared Capriati's disbelief. She did not underestimate Capriati, but Hingis never thought fatigue would take the toll that it did on her own body. In the span of 48 hours, she had pulled off an improbable daily double, defeating the Williams sisters on back-to-back days. With a day's rest in between, she still wasn't ready to face another heavy hitter capable of such sustained accuracy. ``I mean, when people said, `Yeah, you've won it already, next is Jennifer.' I said, `There's one more to go,''' Hingis explained. ``I knew I had to face a great player, otherwise she wouldn't have beaten Monica Seles and Lindsay Davenport here. Once you've made it to a final, you're not going to give up. ``I was just constantly getting more and more tired. In the last three days, I could barely walk. It was just after that match against Serena, going out against Venus the next day, then playing doubles, I was dead after that. It was too much.'' And Capriati was too good. She stung Hingis with a barrage of forehands into the corner, heated serves that kicked off the court and foot speed that allowed her to chase down every angled shot. She sapped the clever strokes right out of Hingis. But Capriati's victory did not come through a serendipitous route. If Hingis had a difficult path, so did Capriati. By the time she departed the Australian Open, Capriati had defeated fifth-seeded Monica Seles, second-seeded Lindsay Davenport and then the No. 1 player on the Tour, Hingis. ``I'm no longer going to doubt myself in anything,'' Capriati said. ``Now I know anything is possible. It's tremendous. Just from here on, I will always have the belief in myself that I can do anything.'' To get to this point wasn't easy. Only three years ago, she was forced to go through qualifying just to get into a major. Only six years ago, Capriati wanted nothing to do with a Tour that left her unsure just who she really was beneath all the hype. The circle she has traveled makes for a good story, one she could profit from if that's what she wants. ``I would never sell my story for anything,'' Capriati said. ``For now, no. Who knows down the road, but of course, only on my terms.''

The floors of the collapsed school are stacked on top of each other like four thick slices of bread and crushed between them are dozens of the sons and daughters of India's striving middle class, trapped when a powerful earthquake struck this thriving city in western India on Friday. On Saturday, rescue workers armed with drills, cranes and bulldozers, but mostly just their bare hands, continued a desperate effort to save the high school students still buried in the rubble, but all they dragged out were lifeless bodies _ adding to the death toll of 2,400 across the state of Gujarat. That number is expected to grow by many thousands as battalions of soldiers detailed to aid the victims reach remote villages close to the earthquake's epicenter west of here.Many angrily blamed poor construction for some of the quake's devastation. The Indian government's huge relief effort continued on Saturday, with helicopters airdropping food, blankets, clothing and medical supplies to areas cut off from roads and railways. One hundred and forty doctors from New Delhi and other parts of India, who volunteered to help treat an estimated 15,000 injured people, have been flown to the worst affected areas. The devastation from the earthquake _ which India said showed a preliminary magnitude of 6.9 and the U.S. Geological Survey put at 7.9 _ is gravest around Bhuj, a city of 150,000 near the Arabian Sea and the epicenter of the earthquake. Still, about 350 people have perished here. In neighboring Pakistan, the quake was reported to have killed 14 people. Each individual story of loss has its own poignancy, but the fate of the students at the Swamimarayan school seems especially cruel. These teenagers, with their dreams of being doctors, computer scientists and engineers, had come to school on Republic Day, a national holiday when schoolchildren across the country stay home, for an extra science lab. About 65 of them showed up Friday morning at 7:30 a.m. sharp, with their physics instruments and chemistry books. They were in the middle of their lab, when the building started shaking violently at 8:46 a.m. Pragna Jagdishthandra, a slender 16-year-old talking a mile a minute, was sitting next to the door of her classroom when the earthquake began. She fled for the stairs. A trail of panicked students raced behind her. She made it out just as the four-story school building, less than a year old, crumbled from front to back with a thunderous roar. Others _ she is not sure how many _ escaped as well. ``But many of the children behind me were trapped,'' she said. ``It was very dusty and I couldn't see. But I clearly heard one girl's voice crying out, and my friend Priyanka was left behind.'' Friday afternoon, the rescuers did save five of the students, who managed to survive because pillars kept the roof from flattening them. ``We heard children crying, `Please save us,''' said D.K. Mishra, a doctor with the government's rapid action force, a paramilitary unit for emergencies. But the last living child was pulled from the wreckage Friday afternoon. Eight dead students were found Friday, and 20 more on Saturday. Officials said there could be 10 more still buried in the rubble. On Saturday, families and friends of the students, and people from the neighborhood, lined a hot, dusty alley behind the private school. They formed a sorrowful farewell line for the youths carried out on stretchers, their sneaker-clad feet peeking from under the sheets that covered them. From perches on the rooftops of surrounding buildings _ which all remained standing _ people watched and wept as volunteers and members of the rapid action force dragged body after body from the school. People lifted the cloths that covered the faces of the students as they passed, to see if they knew the victims. M. Jaysukhlalani, an accountant and father of a missing son, waited at the end of the line next to an ambulance. He had been there waiting 29 straight hours for his youngest son. But none of the four dead boys brought out at Saturday afternoon was his Sunil. Like many of the parents here _ and like many residents of Ahmedabad _ he noticed that most of the buildings in the city withstood the earthquake, while isolated ones like his son's school _ more than 100 of them _ simply imploded. And like many others, he believed that shoddy construction was to blame. He bitterly wonders if some politically connected person got bureaucrats to look the other way, while using sand in place of concrete. He talked of one man's impotence against corruption _ a common complaint across India. ``A single man can't do anything,'' he said. ``Who will support him? No one.'' N.B. Parmar, the police inspector in the area, who was supervising the rescue effort on Saturday, agreed that the building appeared to lack sufficient cement. ``It will be investigated,'' he said. Kirti Gajar, another father, could not bear to watch the parade of the dead. So he and his wife, Meena Ben, stood across the street from the ruined school, clinging to a fast-fading hope that their only son would make it out alive. Like Sunil's father, Gajar, a civil engineer, spoke knowledgeably and with great composure about what he presumed to be the flaws in the school's construction, particularly with what he believes is an overabundance of sand in the cement mixture. ``No doubt this earthquake was a natural calamity,'' he said. ``We can expect some damage, but nothing like this.'' But when the conversation turned to the fate of his son, Gajar's composure crumbled. His hands shook, his eyes welled with tears. ``I can only know when I see his face if my son is still alive,'' he said. His wife then stepped up beside him. She had been there since the previous morning, unable to sleep, eat or drink. Her face was ravaged by exhaustion and worry. ``How can I eat when my son is not here?'' she asked.

As President Bush completed his first week in office, prominent Republicans and even many Democrats agree that he has presided over one of the most orderly and politically nimble White House transitions in at least 20 years. If the first days offer any clue, they say, Bush may avoid the kind of stumbles that disrupted the early days of past presidents and hobbled them as they tried to turn their campaign promises into action. Independent academics and analysts as well as politicians in both parties said Bush had carefully calibrated his legislative offering last week by introducing his education package in a way that made it palatable to many Democrats, even as he reassured conservatives by moving to prohibit federal aid to groups that counsel on abortion overseas. They said that Bush displayed a deft touch in stroking lawmakers, and that his aides have been surprisingly responsive to members of Congress at a time when previous administrations would still be skirmishing over office space. And this week, Bush will lay out a carefully planned agenda to help the neediest Americans through religious organizations. He also plans to unveil part of his prescription drug program. ``We were all raised by mothers who told us we had one chance to make a first impression,'' said Sen. Christopher J. Dodd, D-Conn., echoing many of his colleagues. ``The first few days are certainly encouraging. And a first impression can last you awhile.'' In an unexpected turn that was not of Bush's making, the new president was helped immensely on Thursday when Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve Board chairman, validated the thrust of his economic program in congressional testimony. ``Talk about a windfall, he got a gigantic break with Greenspan's testimony,'' said Sen. Joseph Biden., a D-Del. ``Why God is so good to Republicans is beyond me.'' Bush's success is partly the result of his aides' intensely examining previous transitions, scouring the historical record for gestures and timetables _ and even interviewing important players from past administrations. For all the respectful reviews, the new administration is barely in its infancy and its political execution has not been flawless. Bush's selection of former Sen. John Ashcroft as attorney general enraged Democrats and many interest groups, who criticized Ashcroft as too conservative. Though Ashcroft is expected to be confirmed, even many Republicans questioned why Bush picked a fight with Democrats still smarting from his excruciatingly close victory. ``There are missteps that will haunt him,'' said Richard B. Shenkman, a presidential historian. ``He campaigned as a uniter, not a divider, then he goes ahead with the Ashcroft nomination.'' And while Bush's move on his first full day in office to deny aid to overseas groups that provide abortion counseling was celebrated by conservatives, it distracted from his theme of the week, education. (One White House official said the move was deliberate, because if Bush had not acted ``there would have been a rising chorus from the right.'') Another reality, if no surprise, is that Bush has not tackled many of the most nettlesome issues. And with one ill-considered remark or misstep, the successful efforts by the president thus far could unravel. But when Bush did run into trouble by selecting Linda Chavez as labor secretary, he moved with dispatch to accept her withdrawal and selected Elaine L. Chao, who was received warmly in her Senate confirmation hearing last week. Despite his misgivings, Shenkman said that over all this transition has been the smoothest since Ronald Reagan arrived here two decades ago. ``Hats off to George W.,'' he said. White House officials said they began painstaking preparations for the first two weeks of the new presidency immediately after New Year's and had a day-by-day plan in place by Jan. 8. In a demonstration of the importance Bush's aides placed on his debut, Karl Rove, the president's senior adviser, said that in December, the staff drafted detailed briefing books on the beginning of every administration since John F. Kennedy's. The books included such facts as how many members of Congress each president met with his first week in office, what time the president and his staff reported to work, when he took his first domestic and foreign trips and when he announced legislative initiatives. ``It's important to strike the right starting note,'' Rove said. ``Time is precious.'' White House officials said they were most impressed by Reagan's transition, and they met with several officials from that White House, including Edwin Meese III, who was the attorney general; Michael Deaver, Reagan's image adviser; and Richard Wirthlin, a pollster and strategist. While some experts said Bush had faced an even more difficult challenge than his predecessors because the five-week post-election stalemate limited the time he had to prepare _ a point the new administration has made time and again _ many others asserted that Bush actually benefited from the truncated timetable. That is because with the focus in the press on the electoral dispute, Bush and his advisers could work quietly behind the scenes assembling a staff. They were spared the fate of Bill Clinton and other incoming presidents who for months found that their deliberations were subjected to speculative, and often damaging, coverage. ``In a weird way, the transition following one of the most turbulent and contested elections in history just didn't draw the same level of media glare as either the Bush transition or the Reagan transition,'' said Ralph Reed, a Republican strategist who is close to the White House, referring to two of the president's predecessors. ``And that worked to the Bush team's benefit.'' White House officials said they were determined to move swiftly and boasted that they tied the record of President Franklin D. Roosevelt of having six cabinet appointees confirmed and sworn in on the first day. Officials also said that Andrew Card, the White House chief of staff, directed the staff to focus on the smaller touches, like the importance of returning telephone calls from senior staff members and members of Congress. They said he also set an example by incessantly writing thank-you cards to people with whom he met with the first week. This attention to detail impressed some lawmakers in this city of egos, who said they were pleased to get their calls returned by Card and other top officials who barely knew their new telephone numbers. ``A quick response on calls may not seem like a lot,'' Sen. Dodd said, ``but it is.'' Bush also placed significant emphasis on meeting with members of Congress. ``I guess the biggest, most pleasant surprise, if you'd call it that, was how receptive members of Congress are to come here to the White House to talk about how we can work together,'' Bush said on Friday. ``I think we've met with 90 members of Congress here in the first week.'' About a third of them were Democrats. White House officials and advisers said Bush would lay out proposals this week for helping the needy. On Monday, they said, he will announce the opening of an administration office to promote the further integration of faith-based organizations into federally financed social services. Officials have also discussed creating a presidential commission on the subject. Stephen Goldsmith, the former mayor of Indianapolis who was the Bush campaign's chief domestic policy adviser, will have a leading role in this broad effort, they said. As the week progresses, the officials said, Bush will meet at the White House with a variety of religious leaders and heads of not-for-profit charities. He is also expected to unveil proposals including changes in tax deductions that encourage people to give more money to religious and not-for-profit organizations. Aides said that Bush would also propose a part of his prescription drug program that deals with an immediate mechanism to get prescription drugs to poor Americans in the interim before there are changes in Medicare to make them available to everyone. By contrast, Clinton's transition eight years ago was especially sloppy. In his first days, he found himself mired in a firestorm over gays in the military, an issue that plagued his first term. He was also distracted by severe difficulties in settling on appointees, like an attorney general. A top aide to Clinton said of the new president: ``It's hard walking into the place on day one and pulling it off. They did a lot better than we did. It's pretty impressive.'' Four years before Clinton took office, President George Bush acknowledged at the end of his first week that there had been ``ripples'' of trouble. He was less aggressive than his son has been in pressing forward on an agenda. And there were flare-ups over how his administration planned to handle the savings and loan debacle, and over the abortion views of Bush's choice to run the department of health and human services, Dr. Louis W. Sullivan. John H. Sununu, the White House chief of staff at the time, said, ``Probably the most important thing we did not do well was that we could have had more discipline in the packaging of the message.'' In 1980, Ronald Reagan won plaudits for a relatively peaceful transition, but even he found himself under attack in the first week from conservatives who objected to his selection of appointees whom they did not deem sufficiently conservative, like Donald Regan as secretary of the treasury and Samuel Pierce Jr. as housing secretary. But in Reagan's first days, there was nothing like the turmoil of Jimmy Carter's debut, when there were huge public fights between the campaign staff and a separate operation designed to run the transition. ``Most White Houses are lucky if they get the furniture in,'' said Patrick Caddell, who was Carter's pollster. Referring to the Carter transition, he said: ``There was disarray. We were still learning. And Clinton blew it all in the first week. He drove his numbers to the ground in the immediate transition. George Bush and his people seem to know everybody. They all look like they've been in the same club before. So he's got momentum going for him.'' Most of all, politicians gave credit to Bush for surrounding himself with advisers and aides who have vast Washington experience, beginning with the vice president, Dick Cheney, who was chief of staff for former President Gerald Ford, a member of the House and, later, a secretary of defense. Card was a deputy chief of staff for Bush's father. ``President Bush has put together a pretty seasoned team around him _ if you add their years in Washington, you get a century's worth of experience,'' said Sen. Byron L. Dorgan, D-N.D. ``So his first few days in office have been largely free from controversy.'' Although Bush has benefited from seasoned Washington hands, White House aides said that the officials who had the largest role in stage-managing the agenda for his first days were Rove, who developed the central strategy, and Karen Hughes, Bush's counselor, who was responsible for message development. Robert M. Teeter, who ran the elder President Bush's transition, also praised the new president for skillfully playing on low expectations for his debut. ``If you go out and make a lot of overblown assertions about what you're going to do,'' Teeter said, ``you're just setting yourself up.''

in space another chapter unfolding. the fine chapter f what was once a shining symbol of the future, russia's failing space station mir. today the off-troubled craft was gassed up, so to speak, for the last time. here's abc's mike lee. it looked like a slow-motion video game. it was the nose camera on the unmanned progress shipped inched closer to the abandoned mir station, space history was being made. this long suffering, long deteriorating orbiting lab today received the extra fuel it needs to destroy itself. the plan is for mir's thrusters to be fired up by remote control in late february for re-entry orbit. most of the station is expected to vaporize as it comes down. some fragments splashing into the pacific ocean. the mir was first launched 15 years ago. it was the cutting edge of research into long-term space stations. much was learned about construction, rendezvous and docking. the effect of long-term weightlessness upon plants, microorganisms and humans. american astronauts even worked there. as mir grew old, and with little russian money to fix or replace it, the station became accident prone -- damage from the fire, gaping holes from a collision with a supply ship, computers broken due to faulty cables. now mir is being made irrelevant by a new, multination space station under construction. today's final fuel delivery marks the last days of one of modern russia's biggest triumphs and biggest embarrassments. mike lee, abc news, london.

Former president Alan Garcia returned from exile to the cheers of supporters Saturday, launching his drive to recapture the presidency of the homeland he fled nearly a decade ago amid charges of corruption. Garcia _ who came to power a young populist but fell in 1990 amid annual inflation topping 7,600 percent, surging rebel violence and rampant corruption _ landed at Lima's international airport shortly before sunset and immediately hit the campaign trail ahead of April 8 elections. Reviled by many Peruvians as a silver-tongued crook who should never have returned, Garcia was met at the airport upon arrival from Colombia by some 3,000 placard-waving supporters, most members of his left-leaning Aprista party. ``After nine long years, I am here to confirm for all of you my commitment, my profound belief in Peru and its youth,'' Garcia told a cheering crowd of tens of thousands at a rally hours later in a downtown Lima Plaza. Hunched over a podium draped with red and white fabric, the colors of Peru's flag, he told the multitude: ``In this dramatic hour in which there is uncertainty, disillusion, anger and pain, I come to Peru with a proposal of hope, of work, of decentralization and democracy.'' Garcia, 51, tall and still dark-haired, comes back to a country rocked by corruption scandals left behind by his nemesis, former President Alberto Fujimori, who had long sought to imprison him. Fujimori is now in exile in Japan after being forced from office in November by the scandals surrounding his former spy chief, Vladimiro Montesinos. Peru's Supreme Court recently paved the way for Garcia's return with a ruling that the statute of limitations had run out on outstanding charges that he took bribes and kickbacks totaling several million dollars. He always denied the allegations and attributed them to political persecution by Fujimori's government. A special state's attorney assigned to his case is appealing the court decision. Garcia hopes to re-ingratiate himself with Peruvians increasingly cynical over the release of videos secretly recorded by Montesinos implicating judges, politicians, military leaders and businessmen in a web of corruption at the core of Fujimori's administration. But for many here, Garcia personifies an era marked by mismanagement, food shortages, corruption and rebel car bomb attacks and assassinations. ``The people have amnesia,'' said Aquiles Reyes, 70, who stood at the outskirts of Garcia's welcoming rally. ``His government was crazy. They were thieves. They stole everything from the country. I'll kill myself if Alan becomes president.'' Garcia swept into office in 1985 as Latin America's youngest president at the age of 36, hailed as ``the president of hope'' and dubbed ``Latin America's Kennedy.'' Initially, his policies provided an artificial economic boom, spurred by massive spending that depleted Peru's reserves. He froze foreign debt payments at 10 percent of export earnings, turning Peru into a pariah among multinational lenders. Peru's economy collapsed, and Maoist Shining Path guerrillas surged in strength. By his last year in office in 1990, inflation topped 7,600 percent. After Garcia, most Peruvians initially tolerated, even lauded, Fujimori's iron-fisted rule, grateful to him for taming the rebel insurgencies and cleaning up an economic disaster. Garcia enters the race in a statistical dead heat with two other candidates for a distant second place behind U.S.-trained economist Alejandro Toledo, who is considered the early favorite to win. But many believe Toledo will not get 50 percent of the vote and will have to face the runner-up in a second round.

Soldiers pulled out three people trapped under rubble for 36 hours, the first found alive under collapsed buildings from India's devastating earthquake. Another powerful tremor Sunday shook the area, where 13,000 are feared dead from the disaster. An army engineers corp, among the 5,000 Indian soldiers deployed in the state of Gujarat, rescued two men and a girl on Saturday afternoon after digging through the fallen masonry of their homes in Bhuj, the town closest to the epicenter of Friday's 7.9-magnitude quake, said Capt. Amartej Singh. The condition of the three people was not immediately known. It was not known if they were related. Singh said his unit also recovered 10 bodies. But bolstered by their success in saving three lives, the soldiers started digging on Sunday through another mountain of rubble where a resident said he could hear his brother's voice. Rambhai Mulshankar, a 40-year-old goldsmith, led the soldiers to his fallen house. ``I can even now hear my brother's cries for help,'' Mulshankar said. BHUJ, India: Mulshankar said. About 2,500 bodies have been recovered so far. One official has said the death toll will reach 13,000 from the 7.9 magnitude temblor that hit Gujarat Friday. The rescue of the three people was the first report of anyone being pulled out alive from the rubble. On Sunday, an aftershock of about 5.9 magnitude hit the area, said V.K. Shukla, a seismologist at the government meteorology center in India's capital, New Delhi. The exact magnitude has not been calculated, but it is in the range of 5.9 and 6, with an epicenter about 12 miles from the epicenter of Friday's quake, he said. People rushed out of their homes as they were woken up by the tremor around 6.45 a.m. in Ahmedabad, the commercial capital of Gujarat state, where more than 400 people died in Friday's quake. Homeless people sleeping in the open in biting cold also were woken up.

Angry survivors of India's severe earthquake accused authorities of conducting a sluggish rescue effort that has left thousands trapped under rubble as hope of their survival fades. Two days after the magnitude-7.9 quake struck, state authorities were frantically looking for fork lifts, cranes and metal cutting equipment to reach trapped victims. Rescue workers and residents clawed through the rubble of collapsed buildings with sticks, iron rods and bare hands. More than 6,000 people were confirmed dead, and officials said the final death toll could be thousands more. ``We lost precious hours soon after the earthquake. Every state government officer we called was away at a parade. Even police came six hours after the quake,'' said Dhrumal Vaidya, a movie cameraman, on Saturday. State government officials were attending a military parade to commemorate the adoption of India's constitution in 1950 when the earthquake struck. In Vaidya's neighborhood of Ahmedabad, a six-story apartment block came crashing down, killing at least five people and trapping another 14 people under a heap of concrete slabs. At almost all the collapsed 42 buildings in the state capital, local residents complained they had to organize rescues themselves. ``The municipal corporation has not helped at all,'' Ashok Patel, a bank manager in a neighborhood where residents struggled to lift debris with a crane. ``We private citizens have arranged for this single crane,'' he said. ``We need at least another two cranes, but who will listen to us?'' Part of Patel's office caved in and the entrance was blocked by a 40-foot-long slab from an adjacent 10-story apartment building. Gujarat state's home minister, Haren Pandya, said authorities urgently need more cranes, gas torches, vehicles, bulldozers, blankets and medical equipment. ``Our need is so much more than what we have,'' he said. Some of the equipment in Ahmedabad was sent to Bhuj, a town of 150,000 people that was flattened because it was close to the epicenter of the earthquake. Gujarat's minister for transport and information technology, Bimal Shah, defended the government's efforts to help trapped people and urged people to wait for engineers and rescue specialists to arrive. ``Rescue operations after an earthquake is a specialized task,'' he said. ``You can't have people rushing in to pull at the masonry in a haphazard manner, especially if there are people trapped under the rubble.'' Vaidya blamed poor enforcement of construction standards for many deaths. ``So many buildings have come up in recent years which clearly wouldn't meet any of the building standards,'' he said. ``Unscrupulous builders get away with it, and it takes a tragedy like this for people to realize they've been cheated.''

Soldiers digging through the ruins of crushed buildings Sunday pursued the faint voices of survivors of India's devastating earthquake, but the official death toll of more than 6,000 was expected to climb by several thousand _ or several times. A 3-year-old girl was unearthed from the rubble in Anjar, 30 miles southeast of Bhuj, where 400 children were buried under toppling buildings as they marched in a holiday parade. ``She was chanting some Arabic verses,'' said a soldier who participated in the toddler's rescue. ``She was totally unscathed,'' he said, declining to give his name. Thousands of others were not so lucky. Home Minister Haren Pandya of the western state of Gujarat said 6,072 people were confirmed killed in Friday's quake. The toll was likely to go up to at least 10,000, he said. More than 14,500 have been injured, the national government said. ``There are many bodies buried inside, and there are many places with which we have no communications,'' he said. K.N. Mahure, a fire brigade commander in charge of rescue efforts in Bhuj _ the hardest hit area in Gujarat _ put the possible toll even higher. ``There may be 20,000 to 30,000 dead in Bhuj alone,'' Mahure said, adding he was basing his estimate on the number reported missing and the number found dead after three days of searching. ``But we are finding people alive,'' Mahure said. Near where the 3-year-old was recovered, rescuers spent five hours chipping at stones until they freed a 50-year-old man known only as Maganbhai. In shock, he was given sips of water as the workers pounded away at the rubble trapping his legs until they freed him. In Bhuj, air force troops and police followed the sounds of a baby's cry until they made eye contact with her and her mother. Hours later, 18-month-old Namrata was pulled out alive and rushed to an air force hospital, her pulse weak. Her mother, Naina Badrasen Aur, died before rescuers could reach her. Pandya said even though national and international aid had arrived, authorities urgently need more cranes, gas cutters, vehicles, bulldozers, blankets and medical equipment. ``The quantum of our need is so much more than what we have,'' he said. Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee appealed for Indians to contribute, ``no matter how small the amount,'' to help earthquake victims. He said federal emergency funds would not be enough, and noted ordinary Indians had helped the government meet the challenge of previous natural disasters. Indian Agriculture Minister Bhaskar Barua reiterated at a news conference Sunday that it was the policy of his government, which stresses Indian self sufficiency, not to ask for foreign aid. But he said India was thankful for the foreign help it had been offered, which included money and expert search and rescue help. Another magnitude-6 tremor shook the area Sunday morning. It was the largest aftershock yet, but no new damage was reported. The quake was centered 12 miles from the epicenter of Friday's 7.9 temblor. Since Friday, more than 275 aftershocks have been reported, 20 of them above magnitude 5. In a newly developed portion of Bhuj, lime and chlorine disinfectants mixed with the smell of dead bodies. People moved possessions from their homes and set up makeshift camps in two open areas using bed sheets as tents. ``This is death and destruction,'' said a bearded old Muslim man, sitting on a string cot in Bhuj, the worst affected town. He refused to talk about his family and wouldn't give his name. ``I am just an unfortunate Indian. That is enough.'' At least three separate rescue operations were launched in Bhuj in places where residents reported hearing sounds of people. One of the sites was the Vaibhav Lakshmi apartment complex, a five-story building that that completely collapsed in a 15-foot-high pile of debris. ``We don't know who may be in there, but we heard sounds,'' said junior warrant officer R.P. Sachan. ``So many dead bodies have been brought out of this building.'' On Saturday, soldiers among the 5,000 Indian troops deployed in Gujarat rescued two men and a girl after digging through the fallen masonry of their homes in Bhuj. Barua said the International Committee of the Red Cross had offered thousands of blankets, the Swiss government had sent sniffer dogs and assistance was also being accepted from the United States, Russia, Germany and Turkey. Norway and China had offered monetary aid, and Taiwan was prepared to send rescue workers. Japan offered to send 35 rescuers but they were being held up by bureaucratic delays in India, Shusaki Hirashima, a Foreign Ministry official, said in Tokyo. Japan pledged nearly $1 million in cash and supplies. On Sunday, relief planes were landing every 10 minutes at Bhuj airport, where the terminal had been flattened but the runway survived. State carrier Air India announced Sunday it would waive cargo charges for relief material from anywhere in the world destined for the quake site. Jet Airways, a private Indian carrier, also was transporting relief supplies free of charge. More than half the houses in Bhuj, a city of 150,000 people, were reduced to rubble and the rest were damaged. In the congested old part of the city, dogs, pigs and cows foraged for food in streets made narrower by mounds of rubble. ``We are fleeing for our lives,'' said Harjivan Vyas, 37, a factory worker in Bhuj town. ``There is no drinking water, no food. All houses are destroyed.'' Among the dead were 50 teachers and 400 children parading through the narrow old city streets of Ajnar during Republic Day holiday celebrations. They were killed almost instantly when the earthquake knocked buildings down onto them from either side, said Bangaru Laxman, president of the Bharatiya Janata Party of Prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee. Ajnar is 30 miles southeast of Bhuj. The quake was the most powerful to strike India since Aug. 15, 1950, when an 8.5-magnitude temblor killed 1,538 people in northeastern Assam state.

More than 14,500 have been injured, the national government said. ``There are many bodies buried inside, and there are many places with which we have no communications,'' he said. Gujarat Chief Minister Keshubhai Patel, the state's top official, would say only the toll would reach ``five figures. Five figures can be anything _ 10,000, 20,000.'' Patel, speaking at a news conference, said some 125,000 people were ``not accounted for.'' Many could be buried under the rubble, but crowds have taken to the roads since the quake, afraid to stay in Gujarat, and that exodus has added to the confusion as officials try to count the missing. K.N. Mahure, a fire brigade commander in charge of rescue efforts in Bhuj _ the hardest-hit area in Gujarat _ put the possible toll even higher. ``There may be 20,000 to 30,000 dead in Bhuj alone,'' Mahure said, adding he was basing his estimate on the number reported missing and the number found dead after three days of searching. Bhuj, a desert town of 150,000 before the quake, was just miles from the epicenter. ``But we are finding people alive,'' Mahure said. Near where the 3-year-old was recovered, rescuers spent five hours chipping at stones until they freed a 50-year-old man known only as Maganbhai.

He said federal emergency funds would not be enough, and noted ordinary Indians had helped the government meet the challenge of previous natural disasters. At the at the Kumbh Mela, a giant Hindu festival winding down in northern India, a religious leader said philanthropists offering free food to worshippers had been asked to shut down the tent kitchens and donate remaining food to quake victims. Indian Agriculture Minister Bhaskar Barua reiterated at a news conference Sunday that it was the policy of his government, which stresses Indian self sufficiency, not to ask for foreign aid. But he said India was thankful for the foreign help it had been offered, which included money and expert search and rescue help. Another magnitude-6 tremor shook the area Sunday morning.

Since Friday, more than 275 aftershocks have been reported, 20 of them above magnitude 5. In a newly developed portion of Bhuj, lime and chlorine disinfectants mixed with the smell of dead bodies. People moved possessions from their homes and set up makeshift camps in two open areas using bed sheets as tents. ``This is death and destruction,'' said a bearded old Muslim man, sitting on a string cot in Bhuj, the worst affected town. He refused to talk about his family and wouldn't give his name. ``I am just an unfortunate Indian. That is enough.'' At least three separate rescue operations were launched in Bhuj in places where residents reported hearing sounds of people. One of the sites was the Vaibhav Lakshmi apartment complex, a five-story building that that completely collapsed in a 15-foot-high pile of debris. On Saturday, soldiers among the 5,000 Indian troops deployed in Gujarat rescued two men and a girl after digging through the fallen masonry of their homes in Bhuj. Barua said the International Committee of the Red Cross had offered thousands of blankets, the Swiss government had sent sniffer dogs and assistance was also being accepted from the United States, Russia, Germany and Turkey. Norway and China had offered monetary aid, and Taiwan was prepared to send rescue workers. Japan offered to send 35 rescuers but they were being held up by bureaucratic delays in India, Shusaki Hirashima, a Foreign Ministry official, said in Tokyo. Japan pledged nearly $1 million in cash and supplies. On Sunday, relief planes were landing every 10 minutes at Bhuj airport, where the terminal had been flattened but the runway survived. State carrier Air India announced Sunday it would waive cargo charges for relief material from anywhere in the world destined for the quake site. Jet Airways, a private Indian carrier, also was transporting relief supplies free of charge. More than half the houses in Bhuj, a city of 150,000 people, were reduced to rubble and the rest were damaged. In the congested old part of the city, dogs, pigs and cows foraged for food in streets made narrower by mounds of rubble. Among the dead were 50 teachers and 400 children parading through the narrow old city streets of Ajnar during Republic Day holiday celebrations. They were killed almost instantly when the earthquake knocked buildings down onto them from either side, said Bangaru Laxman, president of the Bharatiya Janata Party of Prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee. But Patel, the chief minister, said eight children survived. The quake was the most powerful to strike India since Aug. 15, 1950, when an 8.5-magnitude temblor killed 1,538 people in northeastern Assam state.

The army surgeon had just finished stitching a five year old girl's scalp back on her head on Sunday in a makeshift, open-air military hospital for earthquake victims when two doctors from New Delhi, who had volunteered to help, rushed up to him. ``We need an amputation set,'' Rajesh Malhotra, an orthopedic surgeon, said urgently. ``Please help us.'' A grandmother had been trapped for 52 hours under a heavy beam that had fallen on her thighs when her home had collapsed in Friday's earthquake. She was dying, the doctor said, and the only way to extricate her was to cut off her legs. Soon, soldiers brought Malhotra a small, shiny saw, still edged with blood from the last amputation, and bunches of bandages, syringes and other supplies. He and five other physicians _ all from the country's finest hospital, the All India Institute of Medical Sciences in New Delhi _ jammed into a jeep to hurry to the woman's aid. The next two hours would give a vivid testament both to the bravery of the doctors and soldiers who were trying to rescue the quake victims, and to the frustrations of trying to do the job without needed equipment and resources. Army doctors working at the hospital on Sunday ticked off things they need more of: retractors, forceps, surgical instruments, splints and oxygen cylinders. The volunteers from New Delhi would add more items to that list once the afternoon was over. The flood of patients slowed on Sunday, two days after the earthquake that flattened parts of this city of 150,000, largely because most of the people still buried in the rubble had died. But Mahesh Solanki, a 29-year-old tailor, had managed to keep his mother, Nirmala, alive. She'd been on the ground floor of their three story home when it caved in. A beam penned her legs. She had been caught for more than two days, lying next to her dead husband. Solanki, limping himself and grieving for his father and two brothers, who had died in the collapse, gave her water and put a tin of biscuits within her reach. She hung on, begging him to get her out of that dark hole, illuminated only by a faint triangle of light from above. He tried to figure out a way, but the house is in the middle of a sea of rubble, where no crane or bulldozer could reach it to remove the heavy slabs of concrete that hovered above his mother. Nor was there any way to shift the beam off her legs without bringing the house down. Maj. Rajan Agarwal was searching for the living in the ruins when he found Salanki, saw that the only hope for the man's mother was amputation and took him to Malhotra, the orthopedic surgeon, for help. At 2 p.m. on Sunday, Malhotra and his team of doctors was clambering over huge piles of rubble to get to the family's home. It was only when they arrived that they realized the long odds they faced. ``There's a gentleman lying by her side,'' Malhotra said in a surprised tone. ``That's her husband, sir,'' Agarwal replied. ``The man is dead, sir.'' Not only would the doctor have to reach across her husband's body to reach the trapped woman, but there was only about six inches of space above her leg, giving the doctors scant room for sawing. And he would have to operate on her while lying on his stomach. The doctor also looked nervously at the huge cracks in the walls, and thought of the strong tremors that had occurred periodically since the earthquake. ``Are you sure this structure is safe?'' the doctor asked. ``It hasn't moved since this morning,'' the major answered. Malhotra did not seem reassured. He began to wonder out loud about whether to go forward. He worried about the woman's position, he worried about performing the surgery lying down, he worried about the house falling down on them. The major reminded him, ``Without this, she will die, sir.'' ``I wouldn't like her to die in my own hands, but I'm agreeing to it only because ...'' the doctor replied, his voice trailing off. So the job began. The doctors wanted a battery-operated electric saw, but there wasn't one handy. They called for a torch to light the dark space, and were handed a tiny flashlight. The saw, it turned out, was dull. Time was of the essence, since the cutting had begun. So the doctors called out to the soldiers to bring a knife. The men brought back a long machete, with a curved blade that looked not only dull but dirty. The doctors poured a germicide on it, and passed it in to Malhotra. That, too, wasn't sharp enough. ``Does anybody have a small hunting knife?'' the doctor cried out. Instead, the soldiers brought another machete with a shorter blade. Malhotra tried that, too. Finally, more than an hour after the surgery began, her legs were off. The doctors lifted her up and out of the house, and laid her on a stretcher. In a mournful tone, one of the young residents informed Malhotra, ``She's not breathing, sir.'' Malhotra, sweaty and blood-splattered, seemed to sink in on himself. ``I told her son she might die, but I was not prepared for it,'' he said in the jeep on the way back. As the ride neared its end, he said, ``A wiser man would have said no, and let her die there.'' But her son felt differently. He shook the doctor's hand, and told him he was grateful to him for trying to save his mother. Back at the military hospital, he wept over her body. When he said goodbye to Agarwal, who had done his best to save his mother, Solanki touched his forehead to the soldier's hands in thanks.

to the galapagos islands now, and the oil tanker that ran aground last week, threatening the coastal waters. now the environmental urgency is gone. nbc's kiko itasaka has the story. waves are tearing new holes in the tanker, making it unlikely it can ever be moved. instead, the vessel will probably have to be dismantled. but the good news is an environmental disaster appears to have been averted. currents and winds have blown much of the spill, almost 200,000 gallons, out to sea. a quick response by environmentalists and volunteers has also helped to save many animals. some have been soiled, but only two pelicans have died so far. this in a delicate ecosystem that includes many rare species. i'd say they've been very lucky and i would take this as a wakeup call. with so many tourists visiting the islands, this was an accident waiting to happen, say many conservationists. the grounded tanker was carrying fuel for tourist boats. safeguards must be put in place, say international observers, to prevent future disasters. i am going to help the minister and his people try to develop a response to the incident. meantime, the captain of the tanker has accepted blame for the accident, and will be prosecuted for negligence. he could go to prison. the final judgment and full impact of the accident, however, can only be made by nature. for now, the signs are promising. kiko itasaka, nbc news.

From shootouts on dusty downtown streets to outlaws hanged at high noon, the West long ago earned a reputation for having its own brand of justice: swift and tough. Decades later, that reputation has lingered for Texas, which executes more convicts and has more prisoners behind bars than any other state. Prosecutors and victims' rights groups say the Lone Star State's criminal justice system is right on track. ``Can you be too punitive when you're protecting innocent victims?'' said Dianne Clements, president of Justice for All, a Houston-based victims' advocacy group. ``The fact that Texas has a system run like a prison and not as a resort is something citizens should be proud of.'' But there's also no lack of critics. Defense attorneys say Texas prisons need more rehabilitation programs and a parole board kinder toward nonviolent offenders. And some of the seven prison escapees captured earlier this week after a six-week manhunt said their breakout was a statement about problems in the Texas penal system. Texas executed a record 40 prisoners last year, and has executed nearly three times as many as any other state since 1976. Two inmates have received lethal injection so far this year. Less than a fourth of eligible Texas inmates are released on parole. Although second in population to California, Texas had more than 163,000 people behind bars in 1999, ahead of any other state, according to the U.S. Department of Justice. Texas had 762 prisoners per 100,000 residents in 1999, second to Louisiana with 776 prisoners per 100,000 residents. Advocates also contend the state's legal aid system for poor defendants is less than vigorous. In October, three federal appeals court judges ruled a court-appointed lawyer's naps during a Texas death penalty trial did not violate the defendant's rights. The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals began hearing arguments in an appeal Monday. ``The Texas system seems out of line with much of the country,'' said Stephen Green, spokesman for the California Youth and Adult Correctional Agency. That wasn't always the case. Faced with prison overcrowding in the 1980s, Texas released thousands of inmates on parole rather than build more facilities. One of those set free was Kenneth Allen McDuff, who had been sentenced to die for killing three teen-agers in 1966. His death sentence was commuted to life in prison in 1972 after the U.S. Supreme Court struck down executions as then imposed. McDuff was released on parole in 1989, and was suspected in five women's deaths from late 1991 through early 1992. He was convicted in two slayings and executed in November 1998. By that time, to thwart the release of dangerous felons and in response to a prisoner's federal lawsuit about brutal lockup conditions, Texas was spending billions on new prisons and improvements. The state's inmate population grew nearly 12 percent in 1990-99, the biggest growth in the country, according to the justice department. ``When you build prisons, judges will fill them up,'' said Gary Cohen, an Austin attorney who represents inmates eligible for parole. Texas prisons have long been considered secure, with less than two dozen breakouts each year. All Texas prison escapees except one have been captured, including 143 in the last 10 years, according to state records. But prison security has been under scrutiny since December, when seven men overpowered guards and stole guns to break free of the maximum-security Connally Unit in Kenedy, near San Antonio. The group is charged with gunning down a policeman after robbing a Dallas-area sporting goods store Christmas Eve. Five were found early last week in Woodland Park, Colo., including one who committed suicide rather than be arrested. Before the remaining two surrendered, they negotiated for a brief televised interview. ``What forced me to do this was the penal institution and such,'' said convicted rapist Patrick Murphy Jr. ``The way Texas has things set up ... I'd eventually become an outlaw again anyway because of parole stipulations and such.'' ``They're giving kids so much time that they will never get to see light again,'' said Donald Newbury, who is serving a 99-year sentence for aggravated robbery. ``Their life is gone. Now all they are is a roach in a cage. Things have to be changed. There has to be more rehabilitation in the system down there.'' The court-appointed attorney for the group's alleged ringleader, George Rivas, urged Rivas not to agree immediately to be extradited to Texas. ``He's going back to a state that has an insatiable appetite for the death penalty,'' Deborah Grohs said. But Dallas County District Attorney Bill Hill says the group's alleged slaying of Irving police Officer Aubrey Hawkins, shot 11 times and run over, fits the definition of a crime warranting the death penalty. Victims' rights advocates agree. ``For those who are critical of the system, it's nothing but deflection of their own responsibility for their behavior,'' Clements said. Several state lawmakers do want to scale back capital punishment by prohibiting the execution of the mentally retarded and creating the sentence of life without parole. Another bill calls for improving access to legal aid. One lawmaker is trying to stop executions while a commission studies inadequacies in the system. Cohen, a member of the Texas Criminal Defense Lawyers Association, said he'd like to see more rehabilitation. ``The mentality in the prison system is, `We just need to lock them up,' '' Cohen said. ``But many of them will be out sooner or later, so why don't we do something productive with them while we have them?'' ___ On the Net: U.S. Department of Justice: http://www.usdoj.gov Texas Department of Criminal Justice: http://www.tdcj.state.tx.us

For 30 hours, police and air force troopers dug through the rubble. Then a cheer went up: Drawn by an infant's cries, the weary rescuers saw a woman and a baby alive in a pocket of safety amid a mound of dust, concrete and twisted metal. The men used an iron pole to punch a hole in the concrete on Sunday evening and made eye contact with Naina Badrasen Aur and her 18-month-old daughter, Namrata. After patting each others' backs in relief and congratulations, the men called for silence so they could speak to the mother. Joined by a special police unit with pneumatic cutting tools, the air force team then set to work breaking through the metal reinforcing the concrete around the pair. From the moment of hearing a cry or spotting movement, it can take hours of careful digging before a survivor can be pulled out, and during the two hours that followed the troopers' discovery, Namrata stopped crying and her mother stopped talking. The troopers grew glum as they struggled to cut the hole wider above the baby. Dangling just above their heads were the hand and foot of a woman crushed to death in the concrete. They had no time to move her body. Finally, one man crawled head first into the hole and lifted Namrata out _ alive, but with a weak pulse. Everyone cheered as a man in a turban wrapped a cloth around her and ran down the street to hand her to medics. They gave her first aid and took her by ambulance to an army hospital. It was too late for Namrata's mother, though: Before the troopers could pull her out, she had died in the concrete heap. During the rescue operation, workers heard a woman's cry from the building next door. Digging there, they found Chetna Mangal Das, 36, who had spent more than 48 hours trapped in bed with the corpses of her husband and young daughter. Rescuers were able to talk to Das and give her water and a biscuit to eat as they struggled to widen the hole they had made in the wall of her sunken bedroom. Her head was bloated and purple from lack of circulation. This community of 150,000 located 60 miles from the Pakistan border was the worst hit in the magnitude-7.9 quake that ravaged western India on Friday. Bhuj, just miles from the quake's epicenter, is a ghost town now. As the troops from a nearby air force base went from building to building looking for signs of life, only the scrape and clink of tools could be heard amid the silence. On Sunday, the air force men searched in the hardest-hit part of Bhuj, an area where recently erected multistory apartment buildings had collapsed. Around the rescue workers, high-rise buildings leaned as much as 20 degrees. In most cases, the bottom floors of the buildings had crumbled, leaving higher floors tilting, but still erect. Cracks ran through peach-colored concrete walls. By Sunday night, almost three days had passed since the quake, and hope for more survivors was fading. Many had not given up, though: Sanjay Jayantilal Gaur, 24, his head bandaged and his shirt covered with blood, was one of the few civilians working alongside the air force men and a special police unit as they dug to save Badrasen Aur and her baby. He thought some of his relatives may have been trapped in the same building. ``We heard their voices and we had to get them out,'' he said. ``We had to do what we could.''

Exhausted searchers using everything from sophisticated rock cutting tools to their bare hands, clawed through rubble Sunday hoping to find survivors of Western India's massive earthquake and they did find some. But more than 6000 bodies have been found since Friday's quake centered in Gujarat State and authorities say the death toll could reach 20,000. India is calling for massive international aid. It has requested a 1.5 billion-dollar disaster loan from the World Bank and Asia Development Bank.

This is VOA News Now. I am Kent Kline in Washington. India is seeking international aid to help with its massive relief operation after the devastating earthquake, which struck the country Friday. The official death toll is more than 6000 but Anjana Pasricha reports from New Delhi that authorities say that number could be several times higher because thousands of people are missing. As night fell on the most affected areas of Western Gujarat State thousands of homeless survivors lit bonfires as they prepared to spend a third night in the open. The Indian armed forces have mounted one of their largest relief operations. Civilians, border guards and international relief workers have joined the effort. More than 40 planes are ferrying food, water, medical equipment, tents and blankets for the earthquake victims. But the rescue effort is struggling to cope with the massive disaster. State Home Minister Harin Pandya says although national and international aid is arriving, authorities urgently need more cranes, gas cutters, vehicles, bulldozers and medical equipment. India's Finance Minister Yashwant Sinha says the country is seeking 1.5 billion dollars in loans from the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank to help recover from the country's worst earthquake in five decades. Expert teams of rescue workers have managed to find a few survivors under the debris but hope is fading for those still buried under the rubble. Those rescued included a three-year-old girl and several school children. Concern is rising about health hazards if all bodies are not removed soon. The Chief Minister of Gujarat Keshubhai Patel has warned people to be on maximum alert because aftershocks may continue to rock the region during the next few days. Western India has already been hit by more than two hundred tremors since the initial earthquake, including one that measured 5.9 on the Richter scale. The aftershocks have panicked residents and many are leaving areas ravaged by the earthquake. Hundreds of people are reported to be moving out of the town of Bhuj, which lay close to the epicenter of the earthquake and where more than half the houses have been flattened. Power and communication links have still not been restored in the worst hit areas. Indian officials have cancelled the traditional military ceremony that was to take place Monday to mark the end of the country's Republic Day celebrations. Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee has appealed to the country to contribute no matter how small the amount to help the earthquake victims. The massive earthquake hit India on Friday when the country was in the midst of its Republic Day celebrations. Anjana Pasricha for VOA News New Delhi. Among those providing aid to victims in the quake ravaged section of India is the private agency known as World Vision. World Vision spokeswoman is Sheryl Watkins. Speaking from her home in Seattle Washington she told VOA's Tom Crosby the agency has been working around the clock to help and was on the scene minutes after the earthquake struck. The quake hit in an area where we already had ongoing community development work. So our staff were on the ground within hours seeing what people needed that were already in our projects, distributing food and setting up a feeding center, seeing what aid needed to be delivered. I have the feeling though that the staff must have been overwhelmed by what it saw. Certainly, you know just in Ahemdabad you know hotel, shopping centers, schools, everything is down. You know the largest city in the State and the place that would naturally be the source of mounting a relief effort and the city itself is in bad shape. Now most often agencies such as yours request financial aid so that what is needed can be bought locally on the ground but I suspect given the vastness of the devastation there that might be almost impossible to do. Well, for the immediate needs that we are trying to meet - food, blankets they are available locally and so our staff there have been able to purchase what they need and what they have the capacity to provide. You know the devastation was massive but remember this is a country with billion people. It's a very large country and there's a lot of the country that was not affected by it. So for the short term we are able to get what we need, longer term we'll see if any additional aid will need to be brought in. Short term too there must be some immediate housing needs for these people. There are. We first provided food and blankets for warmth. It gets down to 45 degrees or 7 degrees centigrade at night, so we are doing that. But the next step will be to provide plastic sheeting and tarp. What about long term? What do you see the needs being there? Is it just too early to talk about that now? It is too early but from a previous experience in Central America and elsewhere you know we know that housing will be a long-term need and a very expensive one. You know the short-term needs are fairly cost effective to provide except when there are hundreds of thousands of people who need them. But when you're talking about every family needing a home... you know in Honduras after Hurricane Mitch we figured upwards of 5000 dollars per home and there's a lot of homes that have been destroyed. Sheryl Watkins is a spokeswoman for the private aid agency World Vision.

American tennis star Andre Agassi has successfully defended his Australian Open title with a dominating victory over Arnold Clement of France. The sixth seeded Agassi won the baseline battle in straight sets 6-4, 6-2, 6-2 in a match that took a little more than an hour and a half. After winning his third Australian title and seventh Grand Slam event the 30-year-old Agassi said he was really ready to play well in Melbourne. Came into this week this tournament feeling like my game was very solid. I was in good position physically and then it did get better by each day. So winning it so special, defending it again didn't really occur to me till now and certainly it's a good feeling as well. Agassi also said winning a major never ceases to be overwhelming. He has now won four of the last nine major tournaments in tennis. The fifteenth seeded and 23-year-old Clement had never made it past the quarterfinals of a Grand Slam event but had defeated Agassi in their last two meetings. Clement said he was confident coming into the match. I was not very nervous but today was just too strong for me, too strong. I beat him two times and just with my game but today the game was higher and it was for me impossible to beat him today, impossible. The other winners in the two week Australian Open include American Jennifer Capriati in women's singles, sisters Venus and Serena Williams of the United States in women's doubles, Johnnes Yorkman of Sweden and Tom Woodridge of Australia in men's doubles.

Andre Agassi was standing across the net from the same affable Frenchman he had faced only five months earlier inside Arthur Ashe Stadium. It was Arnaud Clement again, the same baseline player who wears the wraparound sunglasses, the same tireless scrambler who stands the size of hotel soap. On a day in late August, this was the man who upset a distracted Agassi in the second round of the U.S. Open. Sunday, nothing was the same, especially Agassi. With an almost impenetrable focus, he could have snatched flies with chopsticks as he methodically disassembled Clement's dreams, 6-4, 6-2, 6-2, to win his second Australian Open title in a row. It seemed unfathomable, but this was the 30-year-old Agassi's first tournament title of any size in 12 months. Last year, he became physically worn down by a demanding schedule that dragged him across 26,000 miles in one six-week period, and he was emotionally drained by a difficult family situation that sapped his spirits. By the time he reached Queens, Agassi could only stare blankly at Clement when more important issues than tennis were on his mind. His thoughts were on his mother, Elizabeth, and sister, Tammee, both of whom were fighting breast cancer. Agassi wanted to be there, not on a court at the U.S. Open. ``For where my mind was, it was more than being in a place where I didn't want to be,'' Agassi said Sunday, about an hour after his victory. ``It was that I knew where I wanted to be. And that was definitely at home with my family.'' As he has always tried to do, Agassi set priorities. He took two months off before returning to the ATP Tour. He concentrated on his family and poured his attention into their needs. ``It's not about going away and getting right for the game of tennis,'' Agassi said. ``It's about the battle at hand. And sometimes they're on the court, and sometimes they're not.'' His mother and sister continue to fight. But Agassi broke into a smile when he happily reported that Tammee had recently completed her treatment. While he is in awe of their courage, and thinks of his sister and mother constantly, he is now better equipped to handle his family situation. These days, Agassi is in good spirits. And just as important to his tennis, he is in the best shape of his life. In December, Agassi dedicated himself to his most intensive training camp ever, all under the watchful eye of his longtime conditioning guru, Gil Reyes. He was the witness to the number of times Agassi sprinted up the steep hills outside Las Vegas. And he was the one hovering over Agassi when he threw up on Christmas Day because he pushed himself too hard. ``We'd get to the point in the intensity of a session where there were tears in his eyes and burning in his lungs and legs,'' Reyes said before Agassi rounded the corner and greeted him with a hug after the on-court ceremony. ``I'd see him get sick on the side of the hill, but come right back and work harder. I'd tell him, `You'd better know why you're doing this.' Almost symbolically, he found out against Rafter.'' In the hot, humid air that hung over the semifinals last week, Patrick Rafter was nearly immobile by the end of the night against Agassi because of the muscle cramps that seized his legs. Agassi could have played all night. Sunday, Agassi did not have to extend himself. It took him 1 hour 46 minutes to decode Clement's approach to the match. For two weeks, Clement's speed had enabled him to prolong rallies against Yevgeny Kafelnikov and stretch points against his friend Sebastien Grosjean until they snapped under the pressure. Agassi simply nipped the points off early with return winners down the line and forehands that cut the angles off the court. Not even Clement could chase down those shots. And on the most critical points, Agassi had the nerve while Clement typically buckled with an unforced error. For much of the day, Clement busily wiped his familiar prescription sunglasses. In some ways, he could not believe his eyes. As quick as he was, Agassi was fleet, too. As skilled as he was at counterpunching, Agassi was able to absorb every blow. ``It was OK out there; I was not very nervous,'' Clement said. ``Today, he was just too strong for me, way too strong.'' Clement was frustrated by the quick ending, but the born entertainer was a hit at the trophy ceremony. In front of a microphone, he pulled two sheets of notebook paper out of his pocket. As the first Frenchman to reach an Australian Open final since 1928, Clement wanted to mark the occasion. He had something he wanted to say, and he wanted to say it in English. ``I have my speech on paper,'' Clement said with a smile. ``First, I'd like to say it's been two amazing weeks in my career.'' He continued on, thanking his coach for ``coping with my temper,'' and then he hesitated as he perused his speech. ``Skip that,'' he said with a laugh, skimming past the part he would have read had he won. As the crowd chuckled at the good-natured Clement, Agassi was getting a kick out of the scene, too. ``I didn't prepare anything,'' Agassi said when it was his turn to speak. ``Can I borrow your speech?'' Agassi could remember being as young and as wide-eyed as the 23-year-old Clement. Over the years, Agassi has grown as much as a person as he has as a player. The long-haired blond with the rock'n'roll image has morphed into an introspective man still able to thrive in a sport long past the age when other talents have vanished. Along the way, he has picked up perspective, as well as seven major titles. He may have won more Grand Slams by now if not for moments when he has dropped tennis to deal with matters that were more important. ``I think you can always second-guess what you're doing and why you're doing it,'' Agassi said. ``But I've definitely come not to regret those times. I think they've played a big part in my ability to be healthy and to be determined now, and to feel that sense of hunger.'' Sunday, that hunger was visible in the intensity of his furrowed brow, the focus in his brown eyes and the attention to detail he displayed on the court. This is what a fresh start will do for a 30-year-old. ``Last year when I won here, it was the end of four Grand Slam finals in a row,'' Agassi said. ``It felt like the end of the year to me, but it was the beginning. I wasn't ready for the year mentally, physically or emotionally, any of it. But you have to keep yourself working and keep yourself in position. Now, this year, I've won, and I feel ready for the year.''

When Tom Bhakta, an Arkansas businessman, decided in the fall to seek a presidential pardon for his 1991 tax-evasion conviction, the odds seemed long. Thousands of other felons had been jockeying for executive clemency for as much as a year, with more applications arriving at the Justice Department each day. Their requests followed a routine: investigations by the FBI, review by the relevant prosecutors, and recommendation to the White House by a Justice Department office that works full time on pardons. Bhakta's plea for clemency traveled a different route. In the last hours of the Clinton administration, his was one of nearly two dozen rushed to the head of the line without the customary scrutiny. The process was so hurried that his name was misspelled on the official announcement and on the executive order that President Bill Clinton signed. Bhakta is hardly apolitical insider. He did have some connections, but it is not clear what role, if any, they played in the outcome. Records show that on a single day in October, just as he became interested in getting a pardon, he, his wife and his three college-age children contributed $1,000 each to the New York Senate campaign of Hillary Rodham Clinton. Bhakta's business partner and lawyer, Kenneth Mourton, had also represented the broker who in the late 1970s handled the commodities trades that brought Hillary Clinton nearly $100,000 in profits. An associate of Bhakta knew a senator who could be approached to help him obtain a pardon, Bhakta said on Friday in a brief interview. He did not identify the senator or the associate. In the days since Clinton issued 176 pardons and clemency orders, attention has focused on some of the most controversial recipients, particularly Marc Rich, a fugitive millionaire who fled the country after his indictment on charges of tax evasion, fraud and racketeering. But current and former government officials said that Rich's case is just one example of a wide-ranging diversion from a system whose established procedures were more closely adhered to by Clinton's predecessors. In many of these cases, government officials say, Justice Department lawyers and the FBI had no idea that pardons were being considered until late on the night before George W. Bush's inauguration, on Jan. 20. Federal agents, who had scrutinized the other names on the list, could conduct only the most cursory investigation of the late arrivals from the White House. Government officials said the Justice Department had no knowledge that the White House was compiling its own list. But many felons with Washington connections did. Beginning last fall, the notion began to circulate among potential applicants that the White House might be receptive to direct proposals for pardons, said current and former government officials, pardon applicants and lawyers. The result, these people said, was a mad search around the country for lawyers with contacts in the Clinton administration. Some of these lawyers were offering their services at a steep price. The spouse of one applicant said that a former congressman was willing to help her, if she agreed to pay as much as $500,000. Even those going through the traditional process were reaching out to people with influence. Those among the heavyweight lawyers who represented recipients of Clinton's clemency orders were Jack Quinn, a former White House counsel; William Kennedy III, a former White House aide who has returned to Hillary Clinton's former law firm; and Nicholas Katzenbach, who was attorney general under President Lyndon B. Johnson. Bill Clinton has defended Rich's pardon, saying it was granted on the merits of his case, but he has declined to discuss his other pardons. Hillary Clinton has said that the pardon decisions were strictly the president's. Her spokesman, Howard Wolfson, said that there was no connection between contributions to her Senate campaign and the decision to issue Bhakta's pardon. Overall, Bill Clinton's granting of pardons and commutations is comparable to that of his predecessors _ over two terms he awarded two more pardons than President Ronald Reagan did in his two terms. And other presidents, notably George Bush, handed out controversial pardons in the waning hours of their administrations. But several legal experts said the midnight rush by Clinton was deeply troubling. ``There is always a certain amount of slippage in this process,'' said Margaret Love, a former head of the Justice Department's pardon office who remains in contact with lawyers there. ``But here the slippage was massive.'' The results have been particularly disturbing for the applicants and their families whose hopes were dashed by their omissions from the list. After months of work _ following the rules, working through the complex process, and gaining respect for the professionalism of the government's pardon lawyers _ they now believe that they were unknowingly playing on an unlevel field, despite the fact that a president's power to pardon is virtually unrestricted and that the process is in place merely to streamline it. ``It's not fair,'' said Ginger Whitacre, whose husband, Mark, hoped to have his prison sentence for fraud and price-fixing commuted because of his cooperation with federal investigators. ``It's supposed to be equal. And it comes down to whether you have money or not.'' Throughout much of Clinton's presidency, pardons did not seem high among his priorities. By the end of 1998, he had granted only 77 pardons and clemency requests out of nearly 4,000 submitted. But about that time, government officials said, the number of applications for clemency began to climb. The officials speculated that the increase was an unexpected side effect of the Monica Lewinsky scandal. As Clinton asked repeatedly for public forgiveness, the officials said, some people might have believed that he would be more likely to grant a little forgiveness of his own. Signs that Clinton might in fact be changing his use of the power emerged about a year later, when Clinton granted clemency to 16 imprisoned members of a Puerto Rican nationalist group known as the FALN, for Armed Forces of National Liberation. It was a decision that Republicans said was made to help Hillary Clinton's Senate bid. At the time, the White House denied that Hillary Clinton played any role in those pardons, and ultimately she publicly opposed them. Government officials say they believe that felons read the FALN decision as another signal that the president was unsheathing his clemency power. Applications to the pardon office climbed rapidly in the months that followed, with the total that fiscal year growing by 30 percent, to 1,300. Then last July the president commuted the sentences of four women imprisoned on drug charges in separate cases. Around the country, others sentenced for drug violations thought their prospects for release had brightened. The July commutations ``made us realize Clinton was likely to do more,'' said Julie Stewart, president of Families Against Mandatory Minimums. In the months that followed, clemency applications from people convicted of drug crimes and other felons poured into the Justice Department at a rapidly increasing rate. The lawyers in the Justice Department's pardon office began loading up on cases to review, ready for some staggering months of work. At the same time, applicants and their relatives were beginning to jockey for position. Garry Mauro, a longtime friend of the Clintons and the Texas chairman of the Gore presidential campaign, said he received more than 300 calls starting in November from Democrats asking for help on behalf of a relative or friend who wanted presidential clemency. He helped in only a few cases, by sending a letter of support, Mauro said. Martie Jobe decided to do everything she could to help her husband, Stanley, get a pardon for his 1994 bank-fraud conviction. Martie Jobe, a lawyer from El Paso, Texas, obtained the nine-page application form from the pardon office and answered all of its detailed questions. She sought letters from politicians, business people and other professionals to attest to her husband's character. She compiled hundreds of pages of supporting material in a notebook. But still, she wanted to push harder. She asked for help from a former Democratic congressman from Dallas with contacts in the administration. The former congressman was willing to join in the effort, Jobe said, for an upfront payment of $200,000 with a $300,000 bonus if he was successful. Despite her eagerness to clear her husband's name, Jobe balked. ``That was close to buying a pardon,'' she said. In an interview, the former congressman, John Bryant, now a lawyer and lobbyist, said that his fee, which he said might have been less than Jobe remembered, was to cover the extensive work that would be required. ``It's not like you get a check and walk over to the White House and say `How about it?''' Bryant said. ``The fee I quoted was for three different people working on the matter. It was not that I had a friend in high places to go to. You had to convince people at Justice and then get over to the White House to make sure it happened.'' In many cases, applicants have no legal representation. Lawyers who do represent pardon applicants said their standard fee ranged between $2,500 and $5,000 for eight to 20 hours of work. Jobe said she sought out another person with administration connections, who in turn made contact with a White House official. ``It was all kind of mysterious,'' she said. Her husband won his pardon this month. At the White House, the lobbying on behalf of felons stepped up. Rich, through his lawyer, Quinn, the former White House counsel, began pushing for a pardon, something that former pardon attorneys said was unprecedented, since he remained a fugitive. On Dec. 22, Bill and Hillary Clinton met in the Map Room at the White House with a group seeking clemency for four Hasidic men who were serving sentences for stealing $40 million from various government grant and loan programs. He eventually granted their request. At the same time, an assortment of other candidates for pardon were pressing their case at the White House, either directly or through a representative. They included Michael Milken, the former financier who was convicted of securities fraud, and Webster Hubbell, a longtime friend of the Clintons and a former Justice Department official who had engaged in financial fraud involving his former law firm and clients. Clinton ultimately declined to grant either man a pardon. A few blocks away, officials in the pardon office thought they were wrapping up their work, government officials said. Their recommendations had been completed, and sent on to the deputy attorney general for review and approval before they were passed to the White House counsel's office. On Jan. 19, the last day of the Clinton presidency, an announcement of pardons was scheduled for five o'clock, government officials said. But five o'clock came and went. The announcement was rescheduled for nine, but that passed as well. In the pardon office, lawyers stayed waiting for word from the president's staff. Then, around midnight, it arrived: The White House had more names that it wanted on the list. As the hours passed, more and more new names came in, until they finally totaled close to two dozen people. And the pardon attorneys had never investigated any of them. FBI agents _ with no time to conduct the usual in-depth inquiries into pardon applicants _ instead just ran the names through bureau computers in search of other possible felony convictions. By 3 o'clock, lawyers from the deputy attorney general's office decided to head home, knowing that the pardon attorneys would be working through the night. By 5 a.m., an anxious lawyer awaiting word on his clients' fate phoned the pardon office. Roger Adams, the head of the office, answered the phone, sounding dazed, the caller said. ``Still waiting,'' he told the lawyer. As the hours closed in on the Bush inaugural, the pardon office staff were rapidly typing an information sheet for each clemency recipient, government officials said. Most of the sheets listed an array of details for each case: the statute violated, the sentence, the lawyers, and the names of character witnesses. But more than 20 of those information sheets mentioned nothing more than the pardoned felon's name. It was, a government official said, the only information that the pardon office had.

Two weeks after a deadly earthquake in El Salvador, dozens of local and foreign volunteers still dig for bodies buried under mountains of dirt in a suburb of the capital. The grind and scrape of mechanical shovels and lumbering dump trucks have reverberated through the area since Jan. 13, when a 7.6 magnitude earthquake shook the country, killing 726 people, injuring 4,440 and damaging or destroying more than 190,000 homes. More than 850 public buildings also were damaged in the quake. By far the worst damage occurred in Las Colinas, a densely populated neighborhood in the city of Santa Tecla, 10 miles west of the capital, San Salvador. The landslide buried 300 homes, and local residents say as many as 1,000 people are still missing. ``The work is slow to avoid dismembering the bodies,'' said German Schleehauf, an official from the Guatemalan highway department. ``There is still a lot of work to do before the zone is completely cleaned up.'' Police have blocked off the area to facilitate the work. Meanwhile, health workers are battling to ward off epidemics and respiratory infections among the thousands of people, especially children, still living in crowded shelters. In a radio address to the nation Sunday, President Francisco Flores issued a call to help the victims. ``The only hope that the 1 million hurt Salvadorans have is that the other 5 million who aren't suffering will lend them a hand,'' Flores said.

An exiled Chinese writer landed in Hong Kong Monday for the first time since winning a Nobel literature prize last year, but he steered clear of politics at the start of a three-day visit. Gao Xingjian, the first Chinese-born Nobel literature laureate, greeted friends and reporters with smiles but no comment on whether he had been under any political pressure. ``We'll discuss things during the lectures,'' said Gao, who will speak at two local universities Tuesday and Wednesday before flying to Taiwan on Thursday. Pro-Beijing forces on the island have warned that Gao should stick to literature and avoid criticizing Beijing's alleged oppression while he is in town, a little more than two weeks after an international conference by the Falun Gong meditation sect stirred controversy here. Asked repeatedly whether he had felt any political pressure, Gao avoided the questions, holding up his hands to try to stop them. Supporters receiving Gao at the airport included Liu Zaifu, a renowned Chinese intellectual based in the United States, and Liu's wife, Fei Ya. Gao planned to rest Monday after flying in from Paris, where he now lives, said Gilbert Fong, a university professor and friend of Gao. Gao was branded as an ``unwelcome figure'' in mainland China, and he once burned his writings to keep them from falling into the wrong hands during Mao Tse-tung's 1966-76 Cultural Revolution. He fled China in 1987 and renounced his Communist Party membership after the Tiananmen Square massacre in 1989. He has vowed never to return to mainland China. His play ``Fugitives'' was set against the background of the Tiananmen slayings, and China's government has banned many of his works. Hong Kong has retained free speech guarantees since the former British colony was returned to China in July 1997, but there have been concerns lately that those freedoms are under threat. Pro-Beijing forces were critical of Hong Kong government's for allowing Falun Gong, which is outlawed on the mainland, to hold a conference inside Hong Kong City Hall. At the conference, its followers lashed out at Beijing's often-violent crackdown on the sect.

A live debate by satellite between the world economy's elite and opponents of globalization descended into a dialogue of the deaf. But the anti-capitalists shouted loudest. The idea of Sunday's live, ``videobridge'' was to promote dialogue between the World Economic Forum in the Swiss ski resort of Davos and its self-appointed nemesis, the World Social Forum meeting in Porto Alegre, Brazil. What happened was quite the opposite, confounding organizers' hopes to launch at the Porto Alegre meeting of 10,000 activists a serious, alternative economic platform to unfettered global capitalism. The debate turned into an insult match, with radicals in Porto Alegre calling George Soros ``a hypocrite'' and ``a monster,'' and the Hungarian financier bluntly telling Africans that much of the blame for their misery lies with their continent's corrupt governments. The battle lines, drawn early on in the debate, were predictable: the Porto Alegre participants blamed unfettered capitalism, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund for the suffering of the Third World; from Davos came the message that wealth must be created _ by capitalism _ before it can be redistributed. In Porto Alegre, the battle cries were debt forgiveness for developing nations and the adoption of the Tobin Tax, a tariff on cross-border financial transactions named for the Nobel laureate in economics James H. Tobin. It is designed to tame rapid international capital flows and protect poor nations from world market crises. Davos responded, saying that in all recipes for the reduction of poverty, there must be a component of economic growth. Activists watching the debate here cheered when Walden Bello, representing Focus Global South, told the Davos panel of Soros, U.N. officials John Ruggie and Mark Malloch, and Swedish entrepreneur Bjorn Edlund ``you are on the planet of the super-rich ... we are on the planet of the poor, the marginalized, the oppressed.'' ``It would be good for the thousands of businessmen in Davos to be loaded into a space ship and for that space ship to take off,'' Bello said. Cheers turned into raucous applause when Soros sidestepped a question on how many Third World children die daily in abject misery. The answer was an appalling 20,000, but the financier didn't know and remained silent. ``You are our enemies, you are a hypocrite, '' yelled Hebe de Bona Fini, a headscarf-wearing representative of Argentina's Madres de la Plaza de Mayo. ``Answer me, you monster!'' Pouring oil on the fire, Soros reacted by laughing. ``I am looking at your face and all I can do is smile,'' said Soros. ``You have broken off all dialogue. We were here prepared to open a dialogue with you.'' He also said that Africa's corrupt governments were just as much to blame for the continent's misery as global institutions such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. Soros, speaking in English, was translated simultaneously into Portuguese during the satellite transmission. The Porto Alegre forum has presented itself as legitimizing and formalizing the anti-globalization lobby that has been growing worldwide since protesters disrupted the World Trade Organization meeting in Seattle in December 1999. But it has come in for criticism as a vehicle for Brazil's socialist Workers' Party, which governs Rio Grande do Sul state and its capital, Porto Alegre. Governor Olivio Dutra and Worker's Party honorary leader Luis Inacio da Silva have made fiery, revolutionary speeches, here. Earlier Sunday, organizers also found themselves unexpectedly the targets of people power, when a group of demonstrators, singing, dancing and chanting black power slogans, disrupted their news conference. About 60 black activists from Brazil, Africa and other Latin American countries were protesting to press their complaints that black issues were being sidelined by the forum. ___ On the Net: http://www.madmundo.com http://www.forumsocialmundial.org.br

His lawyers explored the possibilities, but President Bush has decided not to try to revoke some of the pardons granted by former President Clinton, a spokesman said Monday. ``While the president may not agree with the pardons that his predecessor put in place, his predecessor did make those decisions in accordance with his constitutional prerogatives,'' White House press secretary Ari Fleischer said. As questions continued to swirl around Clinton's final-hours pardons, particularly that of fugitive financier Marc Rich, who had wealthy and influential ties to the Clinton White House, Fleischer acknowledged that Bush lawyers had looked into whether any options were open to Bush. Fleischer added: ``President Bush will not explore whether or not he has the any authority to take any action in the case of his predecessor's pardons. The president, under the Constitution, has unfettered authority to grant pardons and that is President Bush's position.'' The press secretary was fuzzy on questions of which attorneys looked into Bush's options and under whose orders. ``The lawyers just started looking into things. ... It began with the Justice Department and lawyers, as lawyers do, they ask questions and think about things.'' Fleischer added that no formal legal report on the issue was presented to Bush. Rich, indicted in 1983 by a federal grand jury on charges of evading more than $48 million in income taxes, has been living in Switzerland. He is ex-husband of Denise Rich, a major financial contributor to the Democratic Party. Rich's lawyer is former Clinton administration White House counsel Jack Quinn.

Bill Gates took center stage Monday at the World Economic Forum, goading other corporate heavyweights to do more to fight global disease and expounding on his first love: computers. After four days of attempts to solve global economic problems and conflicts, the assembled government and corporate leaders turned their annual meeting in the Swiss Alps to more direct business concerns. Gates, speaking on a panel with U.N. health officials, said he was shocked by the small amount of money going into research and treatment of diseases in the world's poorer countries. ``There is a real market failure here _ a failure of visibility, a failure of incentives, a failure of cooperation that has led to a very disastrous situation,'' said Gates, co-founder and chairman of Microsoft. AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria all continue to be major problems, especially in sub-Saharan Africa, Gates said, adding: ``Because it is constant and because it is large, it just simply doesn't get much attention,'' he said. On Saturday, Gates announced a $100 million donation for research into an AIDS vaccine and challenged other business leaders to pitch in as well. He returned to the theme Monday, endorsing efforts by the United Nations AIDS program to join with companies in tackling the disease. Drug companies have come under increasing pressure to lower the prices of their newest and most effective drugs, which African nations maintain are out of reach of the developing world, where 95 percent of HIV infection occurs. A number of African countries have reached agreements with drug companies that will lead to dramatic price reductions, said the U.N. agency's chief, Peter Piot. ``This is possible mainly because of large volume and small profits,'' he said. Henry McKinnell, president of the world's largest drug company, Pfizer Inc., said pharmaceutical companies had to exploit patents or there would be no incentive to develop new drugs. In an earlier discussion about changes in technology, Gates marveled at the ``explosion'' of young people using computers to talk and share music. ``In the past year there's been an explosion in real-time communication,'' such as the exchange of music over the Internet fostered by Napster Inc., Gates said. Napster allows people to share music without paying copyright fees _ a development that terrifies many industry chiefs. Under the same principle, people could share videos, movies and even books in digital form. Thomas Middelhoff, head of Bertelsmann AG, has been working with Napster to assure payments to artists. He said Napster plans to switch to paid subscriptions by June or July, now that market research shows there is enough support among users to justify the switch. But Nobuyuki Idei, chief executive of Sony Corp., said a failure to pay copyright fees represented a ``danger'' to legitimate companies. Sony has extensive music copyright holdings. Over the weekend, the forum focused on peace prospects in the Balkans, Middle East and Africa. Before leaving Davos on Monday, Yugoslav President Vojislav Kostunica promised ``step by step'' cooperation with the U.N. war crimes tribunal. Kostunica, who has refused to hand over former President Slobodan Milosevic to the U.N. tribunal in The Hague, said: ``Nowhere is it written that cooperation should be reduced to the extradition of any one person.'' On Sunday, Kostunica urged leaders in the region to enter into a ``democratic dialogue'' to heal the wounds of a decade of turmoil. Meanwhile, a small group of protesters reminded passers-by Monday that the forum still has its critics. Three members of the environmental pressure group Friends of the Earth International dressed up as ``fat cats'' and handed out leaflets accusing conference participants of a policy of ``see no problem, hear no protest, speak no truth.'' ``If you have long hair, an earring or you're wearing jeans, the police have been moving people on, so we have decided to look like the World Economic Forum,'' said protester Tony Juniper, sporting a pinstripe suit with a padded stomach, gold jewelry and a fat cigar.

I am John Bershard, VOA News. Indian Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee says his country is ill prepared for disasters such as Friday's earthquake in Western India. The quake is estimated to have killed 20,000 people. Mr. Vajpayee said he's forming a national agency to handle such calamities. He made the comments after touring the area Monday. In the town of Anjar this relative of a trapped person tells a reporter the man is digging himself out. We have given chisel and hammer also so that he himself can break the stones also. Whatever energy he is having now, that he's helping himself. So he's chipping away at a concrete block that is trapping his leg? Exactly, because no other person could reach up to that level. Elsewhere the focus is shifted from rescue to relief for people who have no food or shelter. Three ships and one special train are on their way to Gujarat with doctors, nurses, medicines, food, volunteers and bulldozers.

This is VOA News Now coming to you from Washington. I am Tony Riggs. Here's more on our top story. After three consecutive cold nights, hopes of finding any more people alive in the rubble left by Friday's deadly quake in India are fading. But there are still occasional reports of lucky survivors. The latest is of a four year old boy. He was found alive after being buried under the rubble for more than three days. But rescue workers say they fear they will have to amputate a limb to get him out. A member of a British rescue team told Reuter's news agency, they have asked for surgeons to perform the amputation. The boy's brother was already dead and their mother died beside him soon after the rescuers arrived.

First, an update of world news with Rebecca Ward. Thank you Tony. India's Defense Minister says as many as 100,000 people may have died in the earthquake that struck Gujarat State Friday. In an interview late Monday with the BBC, George Fernandez says another 200,000 people were injured. There is little hope of finding any more survivors in the rubble. Rescue worker Sanjay Sejwal says a five year old boy was one of the lucky ones on Monday. They dug a hole and gave him water to drink and kept him alive. And the boy's still suffering from trauma because he keeps saying even though he's rescued and he has bad bruises all over his face and body, he keeps saying "Save me, get me out of here". The focus in Gujarat has now shifted from rescue to relief for people who have no food or shelter. The Indian government has sent special trains and a ship to Gujarat with medical workers and relief supplies.

The majority leader of the Senate criticized Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton, D-N.Y., on Monday for the gifts she and former President Clinton accepted last year, and he suggested that the Senate might consider extending its gift restrictions so that they take effect as soon as a new senator is elected. Sen. Trent Lott, R-Miss., also termed as ``outrageous'' Bill Clinton's pardon of Marc Rich, a fugitive commodities trader. In an appearance on MSNBC's ``Hardball with Chris Matthews,'' he said Congress should investigate the pardon to ``see what happened and what we can do.'' He said, ``This was clearly indefensible.'' President Bush said Monday that he did not plan to reverse any of the pardons the former president granted in his last hours in office. He said he did not agree with Clinton's decision on Rich, but also that he wanted to uphold the constitutional power of the president to grant pardons. ``I am troubled by the decision the president made,'' he told reporters during a photo session in the Oval Office. ``I would not have made that decision,'' he added. ``But nevertheless he was the president, he had the right to do so, to make that decision, and he did. And I'm going to protect that privilege not only for me but for future presidents as well.'' Clinton's flurry of last-minute pardons has sparked a storm on Capitol Hill, with Republicans once again speaking of new rounds of investigations, particularly into the pardon of Rich, who has lived for exile for 17 years in Switzerland. He was charged with mail fraud, racketeering, income tax evasion and trading oil with Iran during a U.S. trade embargo. Two of his companies pleaded guilty in the 1980s to making false statements in a scheme to circumvent profit controls and evade taxes. Rich's former wife, Denise, has contributed to Democrats, including Clinton. With Clinton no longer in the White House, congressional Democrats have conspicuously chosen not to defend him this time and a number of them have grumbled privately that they are tired of having to deal with such controversies. Sen. Tom Daschle, the minority leader from South Dakota, flatly criticized the pardon of Rich last week. And on Sunday, Rep. Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., would only say, ``It well could have been that I would have not, if I were in his position, made this pardon, but I don't know all the facts.'' Also controversial was the disclosure by the former president and first lady that they accepted more than $190,000 in gifts last year, including paintings, lamps, chairs, china, two carpets, flatware, a kitchen table and chairs, televisions, a videodisc player, two sofas, an easy chair, a chandelier and two coffee tables. Under Senate gift restrictions, Clinton could not have accepted such expensive gifts once she was sworn in unless she had a specific waiver from the Senate Ethics Committee. Sen. Clinton, at a New York news conference Monday, where she said it was her intention to vote against confirming John Ashcroft as attorney general, refused to discuss the gifts at any length, saying: ``We followed all the rules. I am not going to get into any more details. We complied with everything that presidents and their families are expected to comply with.'' She also suggested that on a yearly basis the Clintons had accepted gifts in the White House at the same level as former President Bush and his wife, Barbara. Clinton also refused to discuss the pardons her husband issued during his last few hours in the White House. ``You're going to have to ask the president's transition office for a comment,'' she said. ``I have no opinion. I had no opinion before. I had no opinion at the time. I have no opinion now.'' But others in Congress did discuss such issues. Lott called the Clintons' acceptance of gifts ``not a good decision'' and said the Senate might examine whether the gift restrictions should start when a senator is elected, as opposed to when the lawmaker is sworn in to office. Lott spoke under prodding from Matthews, the host of the MSNBC talk show, and quickly tried to soften his words about Clinton. ``I'm going to work with her,'' he said. ``I've got to get along with her. I don't want to start off beating up on her.'' Separately, Sen. John McCain, the Arizona Republican who was one of the authors of the gift restrictions, spoke out after a town hall meeting in Arkansas where he and Sen. Russell Feingold, D-Wis., were trying to build support for new legislation to ban large, unregulated contributions to the political parties. McCain called the gifts ``a violation of the spirit if not the letter of the gift ban.'' Of the Rich pardon, he said, ``I do not question the motives, nor do I know the motives, for the president pardoning Marc Rich.'' But he added, ``I do know that there is a terrible appearance of impropriety when a million dollars in soft money is given by the ex-wife of a fugitive from justice.'' Feingold said, ``I was appalled by the connection between the pardon and the soft money.'' He added, ``It's very troubling when something as sacred as the presidential pardon can become a part of this soft money mess.'' Jack Quinn, a former White House counsel who is now an attorney for Rich, has argued that others who engaged in similar transactions were never charged with crimes. He said his discussion with President Clinton about the case was on the legal merits and did not stray into politics.

Hoping to validate its crackdown on Falun Gong, China on Tuesday portrayed five people who set themselves on fire in Tiananmen Square as obsessive sect members, among them a 12-year-old girl who cried out to her mother to be saved. In its first comprehensive account of the attempted group suicide on Jan. 23, the government said seven Falun Gong followers _ not five as it previously reported _ sought to commit suicide in hopes of ``ascending to heaven.'' State television broadcast security camera footage of followers engulfed in flames and police rushing to put them out with fire extinguishers. One man, his body and clothes charred and blackened, sat crossed-legged _ a distinctive Falun Gong meditation pose _ after police had doused the flames. Of the five who succeeded in setting fire to themselves, 36-year-old Liu Chunling died. Her 12-year-old daughter, Liu Siying, was among four others seriously injured, the government's Xinhua News Agency said. ``Mom, uncle, help! Help me!'' Xinhua said the girl cried as she caught fire. China Central Television showed her lying on Tiananmen's flagstones, her face, eyes and lips charred black in a cobweb pattern. ``Mom. Mom,'' she whimpered. Police stopped two others from igniting themselves, among them a woman who drank gasoline from a Sprite bottle and repeatedly yelled, ``Let me go to heaven!'' after officers took away her lighter, Xinhua said. Falun Gong has denied that the four women and one man who lit themselves on fire were members of the group. It said the group's founder, Li Hongzhi, clearly prohibits suicide in his teachings and described brief Chinese government accounts of the act last week as an attempt to defame the group. The attempted group suicide appeared to be the most radical act in what has largely been a campaign of civil disobedience against the communist government's 18-month ban on the group. It came three weeks after Li, who lives in New York, called for more vigorous action to protest the crackdown. In the lengthy state media accounts and a separate editorial, the government attempted to fix blame on Li. The reports reiterated claims that the sect has caused more than 1,600 deaths and cited Li's Jan. 1 essay posted on group Web sites in which he suggested the crackdown was pushing the sect ``beyond tolerance.'' ``The tragic participants in this self-immolation were cheated, poisoned and controlled by Li Hongzhi, serving as the canon fodder and sacrificial objects for Li to reach his most evil goal,'' Xinhua said in the editorial. The reports dwelled on 12-year-old Liu. She suffered burns over 40 percent of her body, an injured windpipe and fourth-degree burns to her face, and all her fingers may have to be amputated, Xinhua said. ``A healthy girl has become a life-long physically impaired person in an instant.'' Liu's mother, who died of her burns, introduced her to Falun Gong last March, Xinhua said. It said fellow practitioners encouraged Liu to set herself on fire by telling her the flames would not hurt her and would lead her to paradise. ``Didn't you know using a lighter to set fire to yourself would hurt?'' state television showed a hospital nurse asking the girl, whose gauze-covered body lay flat on a gurney. Liu replied she didn't know. She was shown telling a TV reporter: ``Auntie, I thought the road to the heavenly kingdom was golden.'' Falun Gong's mixture of slow-motion exercises and eclectic philosophy drawn from Buddhism, Taoism and Li's ideas attracted millions of Chinese before it was outlawed in July 1999. Practitioners claim Falun Gong improves health and morality and gives experts supernatural powers. Unmentioned in the state media reports was the crackdown's relentless pursuit of practitioners. A Hong Kong-based rights group has counted more than 100 deaths of followers, mostly as a result of police abuse. Thousands are reported to have been put in prison camps and deprogramming centers. The unrepentant have been fired from their jobs and hounded from their homes. Xinhua said the seven ``obsessive'' Falun Gong followers came to Beijing from the central city of Kaifeng. They put gasoline in plastic bottles of Sprite because ``gasoline looks similar to Sprite,'' they each carried two lighters and agreed to ignite themselves at 2:30 p.m. at different locations on Tiananmen's vast plaza, it said. ``The actions of the self-immolators _ going to Tiananmen Square with the intention of 'ascending to heaven' and 'completion,' sitting in meditation, shouting cult slogans _ clearly proves that they were genuine 'Falun Gong' obsessives,'' Xinhua said in a separate commentary.

Just as Peru appeared set to restore credibility to its tattered democracy, the release of videos clandestinely taken by the country's fugitive former spymaster has shown just how corrupted its institutions were and cast a shadow of fear over upcoming general elections. Only a few of the 2,400 videos _ many apparently showing lawmakers and judges accepting bribes, favors or other incriminating acts _ taped by ex-spy chief Vladimiro Montesinos and his allies have come to light. But they reveal a sordid tale of Montesinos manipulating all levels of government, the judiciary and military with bribes, favors and, presumably, blackmail. Montesinos was former President Alberto Fujimori's top adviser and national security chief. He fled the country in October after a video showing him apparently bribing a congressman set off a scandal that eventually toppled Fujimori. Montesinos' current location is unknown. ``It's distorting the whole electoral process terribly,'' said economist Hernando de Soto, referring to April 8 general elections. ``How can you have elections in a process where the friends of your candidates, the associates of your candidates or the candidates themselves might be involved.'' Many of Peru's powerful who had dealings with Montesinos are reported to be frantically maneuvering behind the scenes, offering top dollar, to retrieve incriminating tapes they appear in. The tapes are now under review in the courts. So far, the tapes, have led to criminal investigations of the former president of the National Election Board, three Supreme Court judges, a district mayor, and a congressman who was known as an anti-corruption crusader. At least one possibly incriminating video titled ``Montesinos with judicial magistrates'' has disappeared, said special state's attorney Jose Ugaz. On Monday, Ugaz asked the president of the Supreme Court to copy all of the videos and put them in the safe of the state-owned Banco de la Nacion bank to guarantee they don't disappear. Peru's Interim President Valentin Paniagua has urged Congress and the courts to take whatever steps necessary to finish reviewing the videos and make them public before the elections. His council of ministers has asked for a complete listing of all those seen meeting with Montesinos or his associates, and an accounting of who among them are suspected of illicit involvement with Montesinos. What Fujimori dismissed as wild conspiracy theories by his opponents a few years ago are now showing up in grainy black and white _ and the damage is crossing all political lines. Congressman Ernesto Gamarra, a member of a congressional commission investigating Montesinos and his alleged accomplices, was perhaps the most surprising to fall. Suspended from Congress and facing possible criminal charges, Gamarra insisted last week that he did not know the $4,000 campaign contribution he was seen taking in a video taped in 1998 was coming from a Montesinos crony. What he did not, or could not, explain was his apparent promise in the video to use his influence to steer investigative journalists away from an alleged arms dealing scheme. The man handing Gamarra the wad of cash was the brother of Victor Alberto Venero _ reputedly Montesinos' top financial front-man who was arrested by the FBI in Miami last week for extradition back to Peru. He is accused of selling substandard armaments and supplies to the Peruvian military, controlled by Montesinos, at ``wildly excessive prices,'' stealing $100 million in Peruvian public pension funds and pocketing kickbacks. The Gamarra video, played last week in Congress, has done untold damage to his party, the Independent Moralizing Front _ a political group whose symbol is a broom to ``sweep away'' corruption. Its leader, presidential candidate Fernando Olivera, has scrambled to distance himself from Gamarra. But it might be too late to entice the lost voters back. ``Imagine, the party I thought was the most moral has been infiltrated with people who are compromised by Montesinos,'' said Hugo Lazo, 25, a finance student who had planned to vote for Olivera. ``I don't know who I am going to vote for. Who can I trust?'' Ironically, it was Olivera's party that revealed a video in September of Montesinos apparently bribing an opposition lawmaker to support Fujimori. Montesinos faces charges in Peru ranging from money laundering and influence peddling to illegal arms dealing. Fujimori was first elected in 1990, and was re-elected by a landslide five years later by Peruvians grateful to him for curbing guerrilla violence and ending the financial chaos of the 1980s. His iron grip started to slip when he sought office again last year, despite a constitutional prohibition against a third consecutive five-year term. The videos indicate that Montesinos engineered the candidacy, which led to one of the dirtiest elections in modern Peruvian history, fraught with irregularities and fraud allegations.

Tents, blankets and medical equipment poured into India on Tuesday as hopes for pulling more survivors from the wreckage of a massive earthquake dwindled to near zero and rescuers turned their attention to treating the survivors. Officials have counted more than 6,400 bodies so far and officials estimated the final death toll could rise to 20,000 or more. India's defense minister estimated 100,000 may have died, with twice as many injured. The Red Cross launched a massive relief operation Tuesday to towns devastated by the quake and appealed for $16 million in emergency aid. And in a rare gesture of cooperation between fierce rivals, a Pakistani plane landed near the quake's epicenter Tuesday with relief, including 200 tents and 2,500 blankets. Friday's magnitude-7.9 quake flattened two towns in India's western Gujarat state. Government officials have counted 6,444 dead and 16,557 injured but many bodies remain trapped in the ruins of collapsed buildings. In the highest estimate from an Indian official, Defense Minister George Fernandes said Tuesday that the death toll could go as high as 100,000, citing the high populations of the two main cities destroyed: Bhuj, with 150,000 inhabitants, and Anjar, with 80,000 people. ``This is my personal assessment,'' Fernandes told The Associated Press, acknowledging the difficulty of making accurate assessments. ``I have been to those areas and I have seen it myself.'' The Gujarat state government had a more conservative estimate. Home Minister Haren Pandya said the number of dead would probably be between 15,000 and 20,000. Damage was estimated at up to $5.5 billion. Six aftershocks ranging from magnitude 3.3 to 4.5 rocked the Bhuj area through the night until Tuesday morning, but there were no reports of new damage or casualties. Seven cargo planes were due to land in the stricken town of Bhuj throughout the day with water equipment and a 350-bed field hospital. Red Cross experts began to set up an operational center the size of several soccer fields on college grounds just outside Bhuj. ``The needs on the ground are overwhelming the capacity to respond to them,'' said Denis McClean, spokesman for the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies. The $16 million would be enough to meet the basic needs of 300,000 people for four months, the Red Cross said. Rescue workers kept up the grim task of digging into the stony debris of ruined buildings in what they said was an increasingly futile search for survivors. But not without success: 16-year-old Ketan Rathod was pulled from the wreckage alive in Anjar, where he was caught under six feet of concrete with his dead grandmother for 96 hours. ``I was shouting for help or sleeping for most of the time,'' said Ketan, who could only move a few inches while caught between two pillars at his house. ``I was also crying for my grandmother and worried about my parents.'' He was found only after the army brought in a crane to start removing heavy slabs of concrete. A soldier heard his cries for help and he was removed from the rubble about 10 a.m. ``When I heard the people digging for me, I started crying,'' Ketan said. He was dehydrated, but otherwise suffered no serious injuries. His family had given up hope until the soldiers started shouting that someone was alive. ``I thought they were all dead,'' said Ketan's mother, Naina Narbheram, who was at a friend's house when the earthquake hit. While the search for survivors continued, workers in Anjar were also beginning to use heavy equipment to clear the debris _ a sign that they no longer fear injuring anyone still trapped alive in the ruins. An American plane loaded with water purification equipment, blankets and other aid landed in New Delhi on Tuesday. The goods will be ferried to Gujarat on Indian air force planes, U.S. Embassy spokesman Gordon Duguid said. The United States had pledged $5 million in emergency help. India's chief regional rival, Pakistan, joined the list of countries offering help to victims Tuesday. The C-130 transport plane arrived in Ahmedabad, the commercial capital of Gujarat state, with about 13 tons of relief goods. ``The havoc wrought by the terrible earthquake ... is a great tragedy,'' Foreign Minister Abdul Sattar told state-run Pakistan television. ``Pakistan wishes to repeat our sense of sadness and grief at the terrible tragedy.'' The Pakistani Foreign Ministry said a second relief plane would be sent Wednesday and a third on Thursday. Pakistan offered help to India soon after the earthquake but said Monday that India had turned down the offer. India denied this, saying New Delhi was willing to accept aid from any country. The two countries have fought three wars since the creation of Pakistan in 1947 after the partition of British colonial India.

One week after five people described as Falun Gong members set themselves on fire in Tiananmen Square, China on Tuesday night finally informed its own people. It broadcast grisly police videos of the burning believers as part of a newly intensified campaign to discredit the outlawed spiritual group. Last Tuesday, the government's foreign language news services briefly announced that one man and four women, whom they described as Falun Gong adherents from the city of Kaifeng, had set themselves on fire on the square in central Beijing that day and that one woman had died. But domestic television, radio and newspapers were not allowed to describe the events until this week, when the authorities on Tuesday broadcast a graphic 20-minute television program about the attempted suicides and issued extensive new condemnations of the spiritual group for the Wednesday newspapers. For the first time, the authorities said that one of the badly burned people was a 12-year-old girl, the daughter of the 36-year-old woman who died in the flames. Clearly aiming to stir up public outrage against the tenacious spiritual group and its leader, Li Hongzhi, who lives in the United States, the television show included close-up footage of the charred girl, a fifth-grader identified as Liu Siying, writhing on the marble surface of Tiananmen Square and crying ``mama, mama.'' Later, from the hospital, the child, who has severe burns over 40 percent of her body, was reported to have said that her mother had promised that the flames would transport them to paradise. After the attempted immolations last week, at the beginning of the Lunar New Year, China's biggest holiday, leaders of Falun Gong abroad said they did not believe that the five were followers and stressed that their leader prohibits suicide. On Tuesday night, group spokesmen in New York again said that ``there is no proof'' that the people described in Chinese news media accounts are genuine Falun Gong practitioners. The official accounts could not be independently verified, but appeared to offer detailed evidence that the protest was undertaken by ardent Falun Gong believers who plotted the protest together. The authorities provided the names and personal histories of the five who burned themselves after dousing their clothes with gasoline carried in plastic Sprite bottles. They also provided details about two other people, not previously mentioned, saying that they had been prevented at the last minute from lighting themselves. Tuesday night's carefully orchestrated official accounts stressed what were portrayed as the irrational and cruel sides of Falun Gong and its leader. They marked a new phase in the government's almost frenetic battle to shape public opinion against a group that has refused to wither away since it was banned in July 1999 as an ``evil cult'' and many of its domestic organizers were arrested. (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) Falun Gong, like several other groups, promises its adherents health benefits and spiritual salvation through meditative exercises. It says it is nonpolitical. In the effort to justify a crackdown that has sent thousands of formerly upright citizens to labor camps and led to more than 100 deaths in police custody, the government first labeled Falun Gong a fraud that misled sick people into forgoing medical care, supposedly resulting in more than 1,600 unnecessary deaths. Later it contended that the group has covert aims to overthrow the Communist Party. More recently, officials have begun charging that the group is an instrument of hostile foreign powers and, as Tuesday night's show did, that it causes followers to lose all sense of reality. As a case in point, one of the burn victims and his relatives were shown Tuesday persisting in their claim that Falun Gong is the key to spiritual salvation. (END OPTIONAL TRIM) Many citizens, while suspicious of Falun Gong's mystical claims and leader-worship, had become weary of the government's incessant harangues against a group that had attracted millions of followers, from small-town retirees to university scientists. Many people have said in private that the government created a problem for itself by demonizing the group. But Tuesday night's program clearly stunned many viewers and may have influenced some to harden their views against Falun Gong. ``Exercise for your health is one thing, but this is spoiling people's minds,'' said a 32-year-old shop owner who saw the program, a special edition of the popular news-magazine show ``Focus.'' ``Before, I didn't understand Falun Gong and I wondered how Li Hongzhi attracted so many followers,'' said another viewer, a 40-year-old beauty parlor owner. ``But what I just saw made me really angry. It's a phony religion that aims to hurt people.'' Started in 1992 by Li, a former government clerk, Falun Gong combines elements of Buddhism, Daoism and Chinese theories of qi, or cosmic energy forces. In Li's rendition, those who practice the right exercises activate an invisible wheel in the abdomen that sucks in good energy and expels bad forces, improving health and happiness. Li also attacked corruption in modern society. (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) Those in advanced stages of practice, he wrote, may experience supernatural effects such as flying or being in two places at once. (END OPTIONAL TRIM) Tens of millions of Chinese, many of them middle-aged or elderly people worried about the high cost of medical care, were attracted to the Falun Gong clusters, which exercised in public parks. But the government began planning to stamp out the group after 10,000 members staged an audacious, illegal demonstration in Beijing in April 1999, demanding recognition and an end to the mounting public criticism of the group. Since the group was outlawed, believers have steadily traveled to Beijing and demonstrated in Tiananmen Square, where they have been quickly detained and taken away in vans to be returned to their local police and given ``re-education.'' No one knows how many true believers remain at large, but an editorial released Tuesday evening by the New China News Agency warned of a ``long, bitter and complex'' struggle to stamp out this ``massive evil.'' Official frustration with the continued defiance has been joined by fear that Falun Gong protests could mar the visit by the International Olympic Committee next month to inspect Beijing as a possible site for the 2008 Olympics. The television special Tuesday evening showed a man identified as Wang Jindong, 51, of Kaifeng in the central province of Henan, engulfed in leaping flames as he sat cross-legged in the square. After police doused him with foam from fire extinguishers, the video showed, he continued to sit in the meditating position, his face and body blackened. The program featured an interview with one of the women who failed to ignite herself, identified as Liu Baorong, 54. She had traveled from Kaifeng with the group and said she had a total change of heart after she saw the others enveloped in black smoke. She said she had expected the group to be shrouded in white smoke and feeling no pain as the members ascended to heaven. In the television show and in articles released to the press Tuesday evening, the authorities especially featured the 12-year-old girl and what the accounts labeled as her ``tragic experience.'' ``She had been a lovely and pretty girl with a nickname of `happy-nut,''' began the New China News Agency profile of Liu Siying. Her mother taught her to practice Falun Gong last March, and brought her to Beijing with a promise that, ``The flame could not hurt you,'' the girl is reported as saying. ``It will only pass through your body and you will enter heaven in a twinkling,'' she reportedly was told by her mother. ``But now,'' the profile says, ``her severely burned face and hands tell people that she may never be happy again.'' The girl is reported as telling nurses that, ``Mom fooled me.'' But when she asked to see her mother, the article says, the nurses did not have the courage to tell her that her mother is dead.

good evening, everyone. we begin tonight with a couple of urgent questions for the government. there's a man on trial in new york for bombing the american embassy in kenya two years ago. the fbi says when they questioned him, he told them of another plot to bomb an american ship in yemen, where the "uss cole" was ultimately attacked. question one, did the fbi make it clear what the man had told them? question two, did the pentagon and the cia get the message and do nothing about it? here's your national correspondent, john m wealthy. in the days after the bombing of the american embassy in nairobi, mohammed al-owhali was arrested by kenyan authorities and interrogated by the fbi. he told the fbi he participated in the attack under direction of terrorist leader osama bin laden. abc news has learned he also provided details of a plan to attack an american warship in yemen. al-owhali said it would be a rocket attack, conducted by a bin laden terrorist cell. and it would come in the next few months. the next morning, august 1998, the fbi sent out a classified message, under director louis freeh's name, warning of a plot to attack a u.s. navy ship in yemen. the fbi message went to three pentagon agencies. and as a result, the visit of one american warship to yemen was canceled. the warning came as general anthony zinni was finalizing an agreement for refueling ships in the yemeni port of aden. it apparently left no lasting impression. zinni testifying after the attack on the "uss cole" -- aden never had a specific terrorist threat. all the other ports that have been mentioned here that we should have considered as options have had specific threats. so what happened to the fbi warning? cia officials say they never received it. fbi officials say they did copy the cia. pentagon officials say they got the warning, but had no idea it the source was such a well-connected insider within bin laden's organization. this raises a fundamental question -- if the message had been more clearly communicated and understood, would american lives have been saved? john m wethy, abc news, the pentagon. still looking for answers.

President Bush expressed his condolences to India's prime minister Tuesday for the earthquake that killed thousands of the country's citizens. ``I assured him that our nation was deeply concerned for the citizenry that had lost their lives. It was not the appropriate time to discuss policy beyond that,'' Bush said at a picture-taking session with Republican congressional leaders after the telephone call to Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee. ``A lot of the conversation today was about the aid that our country is sending,'' Bush said, noting that two planes from the Agency for International Development and ``some military planes'' were take part in the relief effort. USAID said the first plane, which left Washington Tuesday, carried blankets, generators, water containers and other relief supplies. A second flight, Wednesday from a base in Italy, will carry water purification kits, plastic sheeting and collapsible water tanks. The relief agency has pledged $5 million and ``is working in close contact with the government of India to determine what needs are most critical,'' the agency said in a statement. It said the United States already has given $100,000 to India's national relief fund, and Catholic Relief Services is distributing enough U.S. government-supplied food to give a daily ration to 100,000 people. Bush's conversation with Vajpayee was part of a series of introductory calls the new president is making to world leaders. ``Good diplomacy really depends upon good personal relations, whether or not we agree with each other on a lot of issues or not,'' Bush said. ``And I'm going to continue a diplomacy that reaches out to people on a regular basis.'' Officials have counted more than 6,400 bodies in the aftermath of the quake and some estimate the final death toll could rise to 20,000 or more. India's defense minister estimated 100,000 may have died, with twice as many injured. The United States has provided India almost $1 million in emergency supplies and is prepared to send as much as $5 million worth. An eight-member American disaster response team was sent to India on Monday. The U.S. Agency for International Development, which is distributing the money, said the United States was sending supplies that include plastic sheeting, blankets, water containers, purification and distribution kits and generators.

The hijacking of an airliner by a disaffected leftist guerrilla armed with a handgun ended Wednesday when the pilot and several passengers overpowered him. The 31 people on the plane were unhurt, authorities said. The six-hour drama, which began on a sweltering afternoon Tuesday in a rebel safe haven in southern Colombia, ended on the chilly tarmac in this capital in the Andes Mountains. It was broadcast live on television here. ``He is in the hands of the authorities,'' said Gonzalo de Francisco, a special representative of President Andres Pastrana. De Francisco said none of the 27 passengers and four crew members aboard the Dornier turboprop plane was hurt. The hijacking underscored the lawlessness that critics say prevails in the haven ceded by Pastrana two years ago to the rebel Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, in order to propel peace talks forward. The so-called demilitarized zone has been renewed several times and was to expire again at midnight Wednesday. Pastrana had been expected to renew it, even though peace talks were broken off by the FARC last November. It was unlikely the hijacking would affect his decision, the president's aides said. Gen. Hector Fabio Velasco, the commander of the air force, said the hijacker was a disaffected FARC rebel who wanted to go to Europe. He had boarded the state-run Satena airliner in San Vicente del Caguan, the biggest town in the demilitarized zone, and used a handgun to force the plane to fly to Bogota. The plane had been conducting a roundtrip flight from Bogota to San Vicente del Caguan, with a stopover in the city of Neiva, when it was commandeered Family members of those aboard watched horrified as the hijacked plane took off from San Vicente del Caguan. Some attempted to run onto the runway in front of the departing plane. ``I tried to prevent the plane from taking off, but the pilot signaled to me that I shouldn't,'' said Adela de Altamar, whose daughter Carolina was aboard the plane. After arriving at the capital, the hijacker allowed six passengers to leave the plane, including one man with appendicitis and another suffering heart pains, Colombian Red Cross spokesman Walter Cote said. The other four freed passengers were women and children, Cote said. De Francisco, sent by Pastrana to Bogota's airport to monitor negotiations with the hijacker, said the man had demanded to be taken out of Colombia. It was the second hijacking in recent months involving the guerrillas. In September, a jailed FARC rebel being transported from one prison to another hijacked a commercial flight and forced it to land at San Vicente del Caguan. He freed the 21 passengers and crew unharmed and fled into the rebel enclave. The rebels have refused government demands to turn him over to authorities.

Rescuers pulled survivors from the wreckage of India's earthquake just before bulldozers began to arrive Wednesday as the government of Gujarat state said 12,000 bodies had been recovered and the death toll was likely to reach 25,000. The estimate is based on the number of bodies recovered, those reported missing, the estimated number still lying under debris and reports gathered by government agencies, said Haren Pandya, home minister of Gujarat. ``The figure I am giving you today is the closest to the truth,'' Pandya said, announcing the higher numbers an hour after the state's emergency control room had said 7,162 bodies had been found. Indian Defense Minister George Fernandes on Wednesday maintained that over 100,000 had died, but Pandya said the state assessment was much lower. The increased numbers came as several rescue teams found people alive in the rubble of buildings just as bulldozers began smashing walls and experts laid explosives to clear away the rubble. A Russian rescue team in the town of Bhachau heard a woman screaming after a bulldozer smashed the wall of her three-story apartment building. The Russians found the woman's hand under a flattened concrete slab and held onto it until they pulled Kuntal Thakkar, 22, free. Then they freed her husband. In Bhuj, closest to the epicenter of the 7.9 earthquake, an army team rescued a 12-year-old girl named Viyanka and rushed her to the hospital. A demolition team hammering its way through a destroyed apartment block in Ahmedabad discovered Joytosna Gandhi still alive more than five days after the earthquake tore through the western Indian state. Gandhi was discovered next to the body of her teen-age son just as workers had all but given up hope of finding survivors and were beginning to knock down damaged buildings and clear away the wreckage. The condition of the 55-year-old woman testified to the slim chances of surviving for five days under a collapsed building. Both her legs and one hand had been crushed by concrete beams and had to be amputated, doctors said. She was in critical condition with kidney trouble. ``I don't know how she stayed alive with her dead son next to her,'' said Promila Ranadive, a neighbor. As the quake effort switched from rescue to relief, India faced expanding needs for food, clothing and shelter for survivors. The United Nations estimated there are 200,000 homeless in the western state of Gujarat where the quake did most of its damage. Countries and groups poured in aid as foreign rescue teams made their last rounds with trained dogs and seismographs before heading home. A U.N. World Food Program flight with 41 tons of cargo, including health kits and generators, left for India on Tuesday. Another flight was to leave on Thursday. Pakistan, with whom India has fought three wars, sent its second military plane in two days to Ahmedabad, loaded with tents and blankets. Aftershocks jolted the quake zone early Wednesday, raising fears that the buildings still standing could topple. Special trains for people fleeing the region were scheduled to depart Ahmedabad on Wednesday afternoon. Among the luckiest survivors were the 800 people in a tent city in an open-air theater in Bhuj. With food from aid groups, neighbors have organized kitchens to feed tent-dwellers and thousands of others still living in the streets. Conditions, however, were grim. People were crowded under tents with sheets spread over the bare earth. Though food and drink were available, no sanitation system had been set up. Bharpi Thakkar, 42, whose husband had died before the quake, was huddled with her parents, three children, and four other families under a tent. ``We haven't had a chance to think about the future,'' she said, sipping tea. ``The challenge now is to deal with the present.'' Despite the dramatic rescues, hope of finding more survivors largely dried up Wednesday. Demolition crews using dynamite began clearing away the shells of damaged buildings and homes. In Ahmedabad, engineers wearing motorcycle helmets for protection broke up slabs of concrete with sledgehammers and crowbars. Clouds of dust rose into the air as bulldozers moved into the ruins. ``In most places we've used a small quantity of plastic explosives to pull down the more dangerously balanced parts,'' said Col. Rajat Raftogi, of the army engineering corps. ``It's a delicate operation which needs very careful handling.'' Officials have also targeted 175 buildings _ most of them multistory apartment blocks _ for demolition or repairs. In addition, authorities were examining 131 severely damaged buildings to look for violations of building codes that may have contributed to their collapse. Trucks moved into town carrying large cranes and bulldozers. Wood was piled high along the sides of the roads in anticipation of further funeral pyres. At the Bhuj airport, workers put bodies into coffins on the runway, presumably for transport to other parts of India. The focus moved firmly Wednesday to the needs of survivors. Kenzo Oshima, U.N. undersecretary-general for humanitarian affairs, told a news conference Tuesday in New York that about 200,000 people were now homeless. A U.N. disaster assessment team is working with the Indian government in Ahmedabad and Bhuj to coordinate international assistance teams, he said. ``There has been generous outpouring ... but the magnitude of this disaster will require the attention and support of the international community even long after the immediate crisis abates,'' Oshima said. Total damage from the quake has been estimated at up to $5.5 billion.

Ever so faintly, people heard a voice deep within a 40-foot mountain of rubble that had been a modern seven-story apartment building until Friday's ferocious earthquake. At the same time, two rescue workers from Britain who were out looking for a place to buy cigarettes got tired of the thunderous traffic jam of relief vehicles and turned down a side street toward what remained of the pink and cream apartment building. A man in a car pulled up to the guys in the bright blue jump suits and said: ``We can hear a voice. Come.'' That chance encounter, on Tuesday afternoon, set off one of the remarkable rescue missions that have saved the lives of a few lucky earthquake victims. Officials in the western state of Gujarat predicted Wednesday that the death toll would rise to 25,000 as those buried in rubble were dug out across the arid region. But on Tuesday, more than 100 hours after the quake struck, one of the interred spoke. Viral Dalal, a 24-year-old student at Fairleigh Dickinson University in N.J., who was studying for a master's degree in computer science, was home in Bhuj for a family visit. For a few hours that afternoon, his life intersected with the lives of John Anderson, a fork lift driver from Scotland, and Dave Maddock, a maintenance engineer from the Manchester area. They and other members of the international rescue corps were flown to India by the British government. (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) ``The adrenaline was flowing so fast you could walk up the wall,'' Anderson said of the experience. In his 13 years in the corps, Anderson had only once saved someone caught in the ruins of an earthquake. Maddock, who signed up after reading a Reader's Digest article about the group in the 1980s, said he had never pulled anyone out of earthquake rubble alive on his missions to Armenia (1988); Kobe, Japan (1995); and Turkey (1999). (END OPTIONAL TRIM) When the man approached them about the voice emanating from the collapsed apartment, they ran to the spot where Dalal's cousin shouted to him in Gujarati. And Dalal shouted back. ``We came over and checked, and we did hear a voice,'' Anderson said. ``But we didn't know what it was saying because it was speaking in Indian.'' The Britons then jumped into a car and careered back to the team's camp site, a collection of red, orange, purple and blue tents filled with rescue workers from Japan, France, Turkey and Britain. They gathered up the required equipment and five more men and rushed back. Dalal was trapped in a small space with tons of rubble on top of him. The earthquake had brought the building crashing down with extraordinary force, but enough of the walls of Dalal's room survived to leave him about a foot of breathing space. He was lying on his back in bed with his hands behind his head. (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) Each time an aftershock made the earth tremble, the building settled a little more, ``like when you're baking a cake and give the flour in a sieve a wee bump, that's what happens in the rubble,'' Anderson said. (END OPTIONAL TRIM) A videotape of the rescue, made by a member of the team, shows the men in miner's helmets with headlights tunneling into the rubble from the side, chipping away at the concrete that tinkled down the side of the mountain, and cutting through iron rods with a gas-powered flame cutter. ``If I knock can you tell me if I'm above you or in front of you?'' Paul Wooster, the team leader, asked. Dalal told them they were directly above him and that he could see them through a chink of light in the concrete floor. ``Viral, we're going to do some hammering,'' Wooster warned him. ``If things start to move or fall on you, you yell out and tell me.'' ``OK,'' Dalal replied in a tiny voice. ``What are your injuries?'' Wooster asked. Dalal said, ``I don't have any.'' The team members cut a square hole in the floor. Mark North Wilson was the first to touch Dalal's feet, and he reached in and shook the student's hand. As the men pulled Dalal through the hole they had cut, his toes appeared first, then his body _ he was wearing shorts and an olive-green polo shirt _ and finally his head. The audience watching the rescue burst into applause, and the team members, sweaty and dusty, hugged each other and patted Dalal's leg. Dalal had not a scratch on him. ``I just want you to lie there,'' Maddock told him. ``It's all rubble out here. We're going to take you straight to the ambulance. OK? But Dalal had other ideas. His parents, his brother, his sister-in-law and his young nephew were still somewhere in the pile. And he was determined that no one was going to take him away until his family was out, too. (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) ``Actually, let me explain one second,'' Dalal said to them insistently. ``I'm perfectly fine. I just need a little bit of water and maybe food. I just want to be here. That's it. That's it. I don't need any ambulance. I'm perfectly fine, thank you very much.'' The team insisted on taking Dalal to the hospital for a checkup, but within an hour he was back. ``I just want to be here because my mother and father might be here,'' he explained. (END OPTIONAL TRIM) Wednesday morning, Dalal, haggard and grave, was back at the scene, wearing a kerchief tied around his head, blue jeans and a short-sleeved shirt. A white surgical mask covered his face to shut out the whiff of death from the rotting bodies in the heat. He watched with intensity as soldiers gently, slowly moved pieces of rubble. It was a windy day and puffs of dust rolled around them. Anderson and Maddock, faces unshaven, their jump suits dusty and torn, sat silently next to him watching. Maddock absently petted a stray white cat as he watched the scene. ``My mother's in there,'' Dalal said. ``My whole family is in there.'' A little before 3 Wednesday afternoon, the machine operator turned off the bulldozer that had been clawing at the rubble with its giant metal hand. And the assembled crowd fell silent. Dalal himself went up onto the pile. The soldiers, wearing black cloth around their faces, had found his brother's body. They put on gloves to carry Roshan Dalal, a cell phone company sales executive, away. Viral Dalal, miraculously saved, will now in all likelihood have to withstand being the only member of his family left behind in life. ``I've just come back from the cemetery,'' he said later Wednesday afternoon. ``My brother _ I just burned him.''

Deputy Commandant Anjay Rampal was in the shower when India's worst earthquake in 50 years struck near his base in western India. ``Dressed only in a towel, I grabbed my boy and rushed outside,'' Rampal recalled. ``I kept waiting until the tremors finally stopped.'' Rampal's family was safe, and though his home on the Bhuj Border Security Force base was badly damaged, it was still standing. But other buildings had been destroyed, and Rampal feared conditions would be worse in town. So he called his men and ordered them to pack hammers, crowbars and any other tools. He didn't wait for orders, and his action saved 84 lives. ``We decided to leave immediately for rescue work because that was the time when we could expect to rescue people,'' said Rampal, commander of the base workshop. According to quake survivors, such prompt action was rare among police and local authorities, where few took the initiative without orders. Many people complained that hours or days passed before they got government help. Newspapers reported that in some instances officials were so tied up with a visit to the region by Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee that they had no time to assist foreign rescue teams. A Vajpayee spokesman denied the reports. After the earthquake on Friday morning, Rampal's convoy of trucks took off immediately from the base for the short drive into Bhuj. There, they found most of the city of 150,000 had been destroyed. People were running, crying and screaming in the streets, covered with dust and blood. ``They saw that I was in charge and started pulling on me, pulling on my clothes trying to get me to help them,'' Rampal said. ``It was total chaos.'' Rampal and his men worked in Bhuj's narrow-laned old city until 7:30 p.m., when it became too dark to work. They returned to base to get lights and were ordered to a girl's dormitory. ``We pulled 18 girls from the rubble there. By the time we finished at midnight, we had rescued 84 people and pulled out 43 dead bodies,'' Rampal said. Within hours of the quake, his men reached four towns in the region. Though they had no search and rescue equipment, they were the only outside help until reinforcements arrived two days later. Inspector Gen. Bakhshish Singh, commander of the Border Security Force in the western states of Rajasthan and Gujarat, said he was proud of his officers. ``Even though their own homes were destroyed, the soldiers went out to save others,'' Singh said. ``They served the people first, the way they should.''

Rescuers pulled survivors from the wreckage of India's earthquake just before bulldozers began to arrive Wednesday as the government of Gujarat state said 12,000 bodies had been recovered and the death toll was likely to reach 25,000. The estimate is based on the number of bodies recovered, those reported missing, the estimated number still lying under debris and reports gathered by government agencies, said Haren Pandya, home minister of Gujarat. ``The figure I am giving you today is the closest to the truth,'' Pandya said, announcing the higher numbers an hour after the state's emergency control room had said 7,162 bodies had been found. Indian Defense Minister George Fernandes on Wednesday maintained that over 100,000 had died, but Pandya said the state assessment was much lower. The increased numbers came as several rescue teams found people alive in the rubble of buildings just as bulldozers began smashing walls and experts laid explosives to clear away the rubble. A Russian rescue team in the town of Bhachau heard a woman screaming after a bulldozer smashed the wall of her three-story apartment building. The Russians found the woman's hand under a flattened concrete slab and held onto it until they pulled Kuntal Thakkar, 22, free. Then they freed her husband. In Bhuj, closest to the epicenter of the 7.9 earthquake, an army team rescued a 12-year-old girl named Prianka and rushed her to the hospital. A demolition team hammering its way through a destroyed apartment block in Ahmedabad discovered Joytosna Gandhi still alive more than five days after the earthquake tore through the western Indian state. Gandhi was discovered next to the body of her teen-age son just as workers had all but given up hope of finding survivors and were beginning to knock down damaged buildings and clear away the wreckage. The condition of the 55-year-old woman testified to the slim chances of surviving for five days under a collapsed building. Both her legs and one hand had been crushed by concrete beams and had to be amputated, doctors said. She was in critical condition with kidney trouble. ``I don't know how she stayed alive with her dead son next to her,'' said Promila Ranadive, a neighbor. As the quake effort switched from rescue to relief, India faced expanding needs for food, clothing and shelter for survivors. The United Nations estimated there are 200,000 homeless in the western state of Gujarat where the quake did most of its damage. Countries and groups poured in aid as foreign rescue teams made their last rounds with trained dogs and seismographs before heading home. A U.N. World Food Program flight with 41 tons of cargo, including health kits and generators, left for India on Tuesday. Another flight was to leave on Thursday. Pakistan, with whom India has fought three wars, sent its second military plane in two days to Ahmedabad, loaded with tents and blankets. In Bhuj, volunteers from Germany, Finland, Belgium, India and the United States were working on a huge Red Cross field hospital with 310 beds and the capacity to treat up to 2,000 walk-in patients a day. Aftershocks jolted the quake zone early Wednesday, raising fears that more buildings could topple. India's Meteorological Department reported the strongest of the aftershocks at preliminary magnitude of 4.5. There were no reports of new injuries or damage. Special trains for people fleeing the region were scheduled to depart Ahmedabad on Wednesday afternoon. Among the luckiest survivors were the 800 people in a tent city in an open-air theater in Bhuj. With food from aid groups, neighbors have organized kitchens to feed tent-dwellers and thousands of others still living in the streets. Conditions, however, were grim.

in india tonight, several more aftershocks in the quake zone. search and rescue is just about over. and now there is an urgent need for more people to distribute relief supplies. nbc's ron allen tonight on the desperation in a tiny town that's been all but wiped out. today, the desperate return to a place called ratnal, once a close-knit community of 5,000, flattened as far as the eye can see. the temple, its heart and soul, now stands all alone. 250 killed here. no rescue crews came to save anyone, and six days later, still little relief. to fully understand the devastation here, imagine a village of about a square mile in size, block after block of homes, most about two stories tall, a grocery store, a clinic, a school for boys and one for girls, now all gone. "my brother's family and my parents died just down the road," he says. his loss staggering. now, the struggle to take care of his family, a tailor, he digs into his bedroom hoping to find his sewing machine, while his wife hunts for clothes. he finds a few old photos, tattered. "i'm looking for jewelry, the money we saved," she says, 5,000 rupees or about $100 -- half a year's earnings. now, they join perhaps more than a million homeless camping by the side of the road or wandering in search of shelter. health workers fears growing about sanitation problems, lack of clean water. some of the most desperate at this dusty garbage dump picking through fresh piles of earthquake rubble hoping for anything that might help them endure. "the wood can help me build a house," he says, "or i can sell it for food." today, relief pouring in from around the globe. so much, it overwhelms workers on the ground. there is not enough help to distribute it. now, demolition teams moving in, but at this building yet another amazing find. a 55-year-old woman still alive, doctors amputate both her legs and a hand to free her, and again tonight, the funeral pyres still burning not far from the campfires where they hope help finds them. ron allen, nbc news, bhuj, india.

In western India Wednesday rescue workers pulled out more survivors of last Friday's earthquake just as bulldozers began breaking down the walls of wreaked buildings. Some officials worry that machines and explosives used to clear the debris would seal the fate of any survivors still trapped in the rubble. The confirmed death toll now stands at 12,000 with another 30,000 injured.

While the International relief effort and some miraculous recoveries continue in earthquake ravaged western India, some are beginning to question just how so much structural destruction was possible. Much of the most devastated area near the epicenter of Friday's killer quake included lower level buildings, according to some could have been more carefully constructed. But the huge building boom in a region during the early 1990's apparently made close quality control difficult. Vikram Prakash is a Professor of Architecture at the University of Washington in Seattle. He visited the region last year on a teaching tour. He became familiar with the local construction. Professor Prakash tells us about one of the main faults in local construction. A lot of these buildings were made very quickly with serious stresses on time and . We were looking at some of the unfinished buildings and it seemed about the construction was, at least for our you know US trained eyes, significantly sub-standard. Most of that would relate to how the steel in the building inside the concrete is joined together. And mostly I felt that's fine but I would suspect that most of the collapses, absolute catastrophic collapses in the buildings that have taken place are mostly due to the manner in which the steel has been joined together with other parts of the building. That leads me to ask about why were there not stricter building codes enforced at the time if communities like Ahmedabad were known to be in an earthquake risk area? Well, what happens is that the building codes are pretty stringent and they are very clear about the earthquake codes. But particularly in a situation where there is a lot of rapid building most of the actual construction is done by large waves of immigrant labor that come in to simply do the work. It's all very rudimentary, simple, hand-carried concrete, poor construction. So in those circumstances, you know, it's the private developers who are really responsible to make sure that all the steel is properly poured, it's properly laid out and properly jointed together. And you know I'm not saying that they didn't properly supervise but what I'm also saying is that there is no natural expertise built into the workforce so that some of the careful attention that needs to be paid to the process of jointing the steel probably was just not present in the everyday technology of the people who are doing the work. As incredibly sad as this disaster is for the future of communities like Ahmedabad, what lesson is it giving for its future as there are enormous attempts to rebuild the community? What is going to actually happen in terms of the enforcement of the building codes is if one can hope that it will be better. But possibly some other things that might be put into place more easily might be if we talk about the destruction that's taken place in the more, you know, smaller constructions closer to the epicenter. Just simpler techniques of binding wall, brick-wall construction like making sure the brick is, you know, overlapped. I think these are sort of simple technologies that one can hope to disseminate amongst the people who are going to essentially rebuild their own houses and hope that the technology... and hope that just the awareness level is transformed a little bit so that they can do a better job. I mean the builders, you know, are probably, hopefully, you know, there's some kind of legal reinforcement for them in the city. But I think a lot of the NGO activists in the rural areas, where most of the reconstruction is probably going to happen with the people doing the work themselves, are trying to and hopefully will be successful in disseminating some simple techniques that can significantly improve their ability to, well not stand up in a 7.9 earthquake, but to sort of prevent catastrophic damage. Vikram Prakash is a Professor of Architecture at the University of Washington in Seattle.

A massive international relief effort continues in India to help hundreds of thousands left injured, hungry and homeless by last week's earthquake. Volunteers and supplies have been pouring into the once prosperous state of Gujarat, which was ravaged by the January 26 quake. However, a lack of coordination is hampering the entire operation with distribution still a problem. The confirmed death toll is over 25,000 but Defense Minister George Fernandes says the death toll could reach one hundred thousand. Rescue crews continue checking the rubble hoping to find more survivors. Authorities have stepped up security in response to reports of looting and food riots.

The split verdict Wednesday in the trial of two Libyans charged in the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 brought to a muddled close a prosecution that represented one of the United States' most ambitious attempts to use the criminal law as a weapon against a horrific act of international terror. Like the trial of four defendants in New York charged in the deadly 1998 bombing of two U.S. embassies in East Africa, the trial in the Netherlands of the two Libyans demonstrated that the United States, and allies like Britain, seem intent on showing that civilized countries have options in responding to terrorism _ and are not limited to military force. The government's reliance on forensic evidence and the standards of criminal law scored one success Wednesday: the murder conviction of Abdel Basset Ali Mohmed al-Megrahi. The Scottish judges presiding over the trial sentenced Megrahi, a Libyan intelligence agent, to a life sentence, although he might someday be eligible for parole. Megrahi said throughout the trial that he was not guilty. But to some of the victims' family members, and some U.S. counterterrorism officials, the verdict against Megrahi and the acquittal of a second Libyan, Al Amin Khalifa Fhimah, was a deeply unsatisfying result. The outcome seemed to underscore the limits of criminal law in these circumstances by failing to punish those viewed by some intelligence and law enforcement authorities as the real culprits: senior Libyan officials and Col. Moammar Gadhafi, Libya's leader. With such a mixed result, Wednesday's verdict brought little sense of closure to the painful case of Pan Am 103. Instead, the trial's end confronted President Bush with his first vexing terrorism issue: what to do about Libya now. On Wednesday, Bush administration officials said that U.S. sanctions against Libya would not be relaxed until Tripoli accepted responsibility and compensated family members for the bombing that killed the flight's 259 passengers and crew members, as well as 11 people on the ground in Lockerbie, Scotland. United Nations sanctions were suspended but not lifted in 1999 when the suspects were handed over for trial. At the Justice Department, Robert S. Mueller III, the acting deputy attorney general, said the government would continue its investigation. ``The United States remains vigilant in its pursuit to bring to justice any other individuals who may have been involved in the conspiracy to bring down Pan Am Flight 103,'' Mueller said. But other officials said Wednesday that the United States was almost powerless to continue the investigation to determine whether Megrahi's superiors were implicated in the bombing without the cooperation of Libya. Such assistance, they said, is unlikely. Moreover, the verdicts left open broader questions about whether the polite rules of courtroom combat, with strict standards of evidence, are adequate in the face of brutal acts of terror. Such attacks are devised by the perpetrators to make it difficult, if not impossible, to detect who is responsible, and frustrate the criminal justice process. The verdicts Wednesday revived a longstanding debate among officials who deal with terrorism. Some experts have said that terrorism cannot be viewed as a criminal justice matter, like a bank robbery or a homicide. Instead, they have said, it is a national security threat that should be dealt with by military force when state sponsorship is proven. William P. Barr, who was attorney general when the Justice Department brought charges against the two Libyans in 1991, said justice had been done in the Pan Am 103 case. But he added, ``The main question is whether the criminal justice system is in itself the right response.'' Although the record has been erratic, presidents have at times adopted more forceful approaches. President Bill Clinton ordered cruise missile strikes after the East Africa embassy bombings. Those strikes were aimed at Osama bin Laden, whom Washington accuses of being the mastermind of the attacks, even though the bin Laden-inspired terrorist apparatus is a stateless organization of anti-American Islamic militants. Senior U.S. security officials have weighed how to respond to other terror attacks, like the bombing of the Navy destroyer USS Cole, which killed 17 sailors in October. So far, while the investigation uncovered some possible links to bin Laden, no military action has been taken. In 1986, President Ronald Reagan ordered air strikes against Libya after U.S. intelligence agencies determined that it was responsible for a terrorist bombing at a discotheque in Berlin frequented by U.S. servicemen. But there has never been any military action against Libya in response to Pan Am 103.
