thanks for looking in. here's our top story this half hour -- the white house has joined efforts to try to end expanding violence in the middle east. a national security council spokesman says president clinton spoke with israel's prime minister and says administration officials have been in contact with palestinian leaders. gunfire israeli troops fought running gun battles with palestinian civilians and security forces again today. more than 20 palestinians have been killed and more than 700 wounded in four days of fighting in gaza and the west bank. the battles erupted thursday after israel's hard-line opposition leader visited a bitterly-contested shrine in jerusalem. a 12-year-old palestinian boy was among those caught in the cross fire in gaza. mohammed jamal was fatally wounded as his father tried to shield him from a hail of bullets. it's the worst outbreak of israeli-palestinian violence since 1996. one u.s. official said the fighting has shifted the administration's focus away from the stalled mideast peace talks.

Pressing a strategy of legal challenges and popular pressure to get President Slobodan Milosevic to concede that he lost elections Sept. 24, Serbia's opposition vowed to shut Belgrade and the country down on Monday in what would be the first general strike in this country since World War II. ``Monday is a crucial day, when schools won't work, students and teachers come onto the streets, the shops and cafes won't work and a great majority of Belgrade will block traffic,'' vowed Zoran Djindjic on Sunday. Djindjic is a leader of the democratic opposition coalition. ``Tomorrow will be a day when Belgrade comes to a halt.'' The opposition hopes to block major roads and highways all over Serbia, to cut off oil refineries and electrical stations, to shut down schools and especially public offices and ministries, to try to show to Milosevic that he can no longer command the country. Already, there have been some blockades and work stoppages, most notably in the mine of Kolubara, about 40 miles southwest of Belgrade. The opposition's candidate, Vojislav Kostunica says he won the Sept. 24 presidential elections outright with more than 50 percent of the vote, and that Milosevic and his Federal Election Commission organized electoral fraud to justify a second round runoff next Sunday. Kostunica has vowed to boycott the second round as unnecessary. He has challenged the Election Commission's results in the Constitutional Court after an appeal in a lower court was rejected. Kostunica has appealed to Greece and Russia to help mediate the electoral dispute and recount the votes. Russian President Vladimir Putin, after talks with French, German and American officials, offered to send Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov to Belgrade to mediate, but Milosevic rejected the offer, according to American officials briefed on a conversation between Putin and President Clinton. Russia has been an important Milosevic ally, helpful with energy, credits and international support. But German officials said Sunday that in a telephone conversation on Saturday, Putin agreed with German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder that Kostunica had won the election. There was no confirmation from Moscow, which would mark a major defeat for Milosevic in his effort to convince his own people that he was not defeated outright by Kostunica. Two senior Russian diplomats arrived in Belgrade late Saturday for talks with the government and opposition leaders. Some opposition leaders said they believe that the pressure beginning Monday must work quickly on the Milosevic government, forcing a confrontation between people and the police and fracturing the ruling circle before the runoff election scheduled Oct. 8. If the civil disobedience strategy fails, there is still the possibility of asking voters to come out again next Sunday to prevent a Milosevic victory by default. (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) Kostunica cannot easily reverse himself on participating in the runoff election, but his name will appear on the ballot in any case. It is possible, some opposition leaders said, that the Serbian Orthodox Church, which has already recognized Kostunica as the first-round victor, could ask people to vote. A Serb analyst, Aleksa Djilas, said he believes that Kostunica's rejection of a second round is a mistake, and that voters would understand a change of heart. ``If people vote again, Milosevic would surely lose, and such a huge fraud to win would be obvious and unlikely, and if it were that big, the wrath of the people would be enormous,'' Djilas said. ``A boycott induces passivity. Why not say, `Let's drive it home, we are not afraid.''' Milosevic tends to give in to the inevitable to save himself when other options are foreclosed, as he did to end the war in Kosovo, said Djilas, a temporary scholar at the Woodrow Wilson Center in Washington. (END OPTIONAL TRIM) While there is enormous anxiety in the ruling coalition, with officials coming to their offices only to talk or calling in sick, there have been few signs of an open break with Milosevic. On Friday, he responded harshly in a Socialist Party meeting to suggestions that he concede to Kostunica, officials said, and his sudden visit on Saturday to a graduation ceremony at a military academy, with his two top generals, was perceived by the opposition as a warning that he would not go without a fight. At the same time, even official figures show Milosevic trailing Kostunica by more than 10 percentage points, and his aura as an elected president has been badly tainted. Even officials who are careful now say it is unlikely that he can remain president long. They speak of a scenario where Milosevic concedes to Kostunica but remains in office until January or even June, then names himself federal prime minister, since his coalition controls the federal parliament. Others believe that once Milosevic concedes, it's winner-take-all, and that even his allies will move to Kostunica. State media are beginning to crack. More than 60 reporters at Vecernje Novosti, a popular tabloid the state took over in March, have signed a petition demanding a return to balanced news coverage within 24 hours. In an open letter, the journalists demanded the paper ``stop linking itself to the interests of a narrow political party or person, but only to the truth and the will of the people as expressed in the elections.'' There is a similar petition at Radio Belgrade, part of the state system, and in a traditional socialist stronghold of Zajecar, Timocka Television said it would no longer rebroadcast the state news. Eight local radio stations said they would also stop broadcasting state news. There have been abundant rumors that Milosevic's wife, Mirjana Markovic, their son, Marko, and daughter, Marija, left the country to go to Russia, but government officials said they are still in Serbia. Markovic herself was seen Sunday in the family's hometown of Pozarevac and appeared on state television news tonight to denounce the West for trying ``to produce hatred that will push people into civil war.'' On Saturday, Marko went to opposition headquarters in Pozarevac to tell them that his father had not lost the elections and that he himself would remain in the country.

In Yugoslavia, the Democratic opposition will open a nation-wide campaign of civil disobedience today to back demands for President Slobodan Milosevic to step down. Meanwhile, a pair of Russian envoys has arrived in Belgrade to meet with Yugoslav government and opposition figures in an effort at mediation. More from Larry James in Moscow. The Russian Foreign Ministry announced Sunday that the two diplomats are now in Belgrade and plan to hold talks with the Yugoslav Foreign Ministry and prominent opposition politicians. Russia's special Balkan envoy Vladimir Chetsov is heading the delegation. On Saturday, Russian President Vladimir Putin had said, Russia was ready to play a more active role in the standoff between supporters of opposition candidate Vojislav Kostunica and President Slobodan Milosevic. Yugoslavia has not responded officially to that offer, but an opposition source had earlier said Belgrade rejected it. Earlier Sunday in Berlin, the German government said Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder and Russian President Putin had agreed that Yugoslavia's presidential election last week had showed the people voted for a democratic change. The statement followed a telephone conversation between the two on Saturday evening. Larry James, VOA News, Moscow. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright says President Milosevic should step down and let the political opposition begin rebuilding the nation. She wrote in an essay in the US magazine Newsweek.

And I'm Tom Crosby and this is VOA News now. Massive rallies are taking place in Yugoslavia in defiance of the government's call for a second round of presidential elections. The majority of the Yugoslav people have been supporting the opposition on the general strike to protest what its leaders say was a blatant attempt to misrepresent the results of the first round of elections a week ago. Most regional analysts are predicting that Slobodan Milosevic's days as President of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia are numbered. 'Yugoslavia in transition' is the subject of today's Dateline. Here's Judith Latham. Stoyan Serovic, a columnist with the Belgrade independent weekly Breme, who is currently a Fellow at the US Institute of Peace in Washington says he was as astonished as all the other analysts when opposition candidate Vojislav Kostunica won on the first ballot against all odds. But in retrospect he thinks the political upset in Yugoslavia was perhaps understandable. It's just absolute surprise for everybody. All analysts were predicting that it was really a huge fraud that Milosevic is going to steal as many votes as he needs and that there is no way, you know, to replace Milosevic in the elections, which means in a democratic manner. Well, it seems that everybody was wrong and Milosevic is going to lose the power. He was pretty weak already. Still, he was able to stay in power and I think that he just made some miscalculation. He didn't expect Kostunica, he didn't expect opposition to unite. Milosevic was lost, he could not really steal a million votes, so he was forced to admit this defeat and nobody expected that. People thought that, well Milosevic can do just about anything. I believe that there is no way out for Milosevic but to step down and I believe that's exactly what he is going to do in a next few days or weeks. I wouldn't exclude some surprises, some attempt to complicate events, to use some force. So they might try to use police, maybe even the army, but it seems to me that he is losing the backing in the army and police probably as well. So I expect that many of his people will probably very soon turn their back to Milosevic and I believe it is going to happen very, very soon. Stoyan Serovic says a major reason Serbian opposition was able to unite behind a single candidate this time as it had not before was that another presidential contender, Serbian Renewal Party leader Woodgouskovic was outmaneuvered and was rendered ineffectual. What Mr. Serovic also called key was the unselfish decision by the leader of Serbia's Democratic party Zoran Djindjic to back Mr. Kostunica and he adds, outpour the student resistance movement that campaigned for the democratic opposition of Serbia and courageously stood up to police brutality, gained the respect of Serbian voters. Balkan Analyst Overec Kasich, says he felt quite confident that the opposition would win in the Yugoslav elections, but he was amazed by the margin of victory. So with over a million votes dividing the two, I mean that's just astronomical and it was beyond all expectations and in speaking with people from Kostunica's campaign staff, they were also extremely surprised by those results. How weakened is Mr. Milosevic by the outcome? I think that you could see the disarray within his own camp. You could see that there is a debate raging in terms of what the best strategy is. It's interesting to me that the first evening it seemed as if they were pursuing their first strategy, which was to try to steal the elections in the first round. And hence the delay in reporting? Exactly, but once it became apparent the margin, the enormous margin that separated him from Kostunica, then it almost became impossible for them to do that. So they had to fall back on the secondary strategy and that's what we have now. The only thing I would stress is that it's possible that he will change course once again and will pursue a third option. What options are realistically available to him at this point? One option is to stick this out and wait until October 8th and then hold a mockery of an election, in which, you know, 20% of the electorate will turn out or less, then proclaim victory on that basis. And then basically have a crisis that extends indefinitely with him hoping that the opposition will not be able to maintain the level of support they have up until this point and will not be able to rally as many people into the streets. The second option is, if he does not want or cannot use the police to disperse these crowds, and he begins to lose support internally, then he could seek an option in which he transfers the levels of authority to another function. Since the socialists and their leftist allies control the federal parliament, he could have himself appointed as Prime Minister of the federal government. So it's hard therefore to see at this point what he would do. I can tell you that he is known for changing course in midstream if he sees that there are obstacles in his path. So we can expect just about everything with him. Now the opposition is refusing to go to a second round on October 8th. Right. How risky is that strategy? And what are the pros and cons for Mr. Kostunica for refusing to participate in a runoff election? Well, one of the cons is that Milosevic goes ahead and holds this election and then you have a confrontation as to who is really the legally elected President. The danger for the opposition only comes from development that's hard to foresee now that Milosevic can wear down the resolve of the opposition. But in order for that to work, he definitely cannot resort to violence because that would just harden the resolve of the demonstrators and he has to understand that he could have the same type of confrontation he has now even following the elections, October 8th. And more importantly the second round could serve as a trigger for greater demonstrations and perhaps even violence. In the days ahead and I'm thinking about the time between now and when a runoff might occur if that happens, what should the international community do now? I would advise that the international leaders, especially from the United States and from NATO countries, should maintain a low profile. Every time they get up and make a speech in which there is a veiled threat or a direct threat that helps Mr. Milosevic because Milosevic wants people afraid that there will either be foreign intervention or that there would be the threat of a civil war. Right now the spotlight should be on the people of Serbia and the opposition leaders. Balkan Analyst, Albert Casetch, is Director of Governmental Affairs for ICN Pharmaceuticals. He spoke with us from his office in Washington. Greg Shelty, Senior Director for South-East European Affairs at the National Security Council says the opposition leaders know they've won the first round of elections in Yugoslavia. To accept the second round, he believes, would play into Mr. Milosevic's strategy of buying time. If they went through a second round, I am sure they would do even better, but that wouldn't keep Milosevic's Federal Electoral Commission from announcing that he has won. So I think it's also a matter of what Milosevic might do between now and another set of elections. Milosevic could very easily seek to engineer a crisis on the streets in Montenegro, wherever to give him an excuse to call-off the elections. This is about whether or not Milosevic will allow the will of the Serb people to be expressed, to allow a transition to a democratic system. And I think what the opposition has decided to do, and I think it's a wise strategy, a fair strategy, is to keep the pressure on. They know they've won. Kostunica said very clearly in his victory rally that to concede to a second round would be somehow acknowledging that the regime could get away with cheating. And I think the point he is making is that he is a different type of person and we have clear signs that within the police and then within the military too, that there is great sympathy for the opposition and that there is recognition that the opposition has won. And I think it's very significant. For example, the General in charge of the Yugoslav army has said that the army will keep out of this and I think it's particularly important that the Serb Orthodox Church has come out and even recognized Mr. Kostunica as the President. And Milosevic must be very worried at this point and this is the most serious challenge that's ever been made to his power. Greg Shelty, staff member at the National Security Council, spoke with us from his office in the White House. 'Yugoslavia in transition' was the subject of today's Dateline. I'm Judith Latham.

Encouraged by cheering crowds, a convoy of 70 trucks in Cacak blocked a key highway early Monday as opposition forces sought to gather support for a nationwide strike aimed at showing President Slobodan Milosevic he must relinquish power. Road blockades snarled traffic on at least one bridge in the capital, Belgrade, and roads just outside the city, independent radio station B2-92 reported. And in the southwestern town of Uzice, railway workers walked off the job. The trucks in Cacak started Sunday in a ``dress rehearsal'' for a series of full-scale blockades. They were greeted by jubilant supporters as they passed through the opposition stronghold in central Yugoslavia. Some people tossed flowers as the trucks headed to an important highway linking Belgrade with southern Yugoslavia. The truckers brandished banners and posters of Vojislav Kostunica, whom the opposition and Western leaders insist trounced Milosevic in Sept. 24 elections. Milosevic rejects the claim and says a run-off election is needed Oct. 8. Workers at two major coal mines did not wait for Monday and walked off the job Saturday. However, the independent Beta news agency reported that hundreds of special police entered one mine _ Kolubara about 25 miles south of Belgrade _ and turned back local townspeople who tried to march to the site in protest. The move was clearly aimed at keeping the mine open; it supplies coal to one of the country's major electric power stations. The state-run power company warned strikers they were endangering public health and safety. About 1,000 workers in another coal mine in Kostolac joined the strikes Sunday. In the capital Belgrade, traffic was snarled by blockades at key intersections. Drivers honked horns and pedestrians blew whistles and shook toy rattles _ playing on a local expression for something broken beyond repair. ``No way are we going to settle for a run-off and that is now the law for everyone in this country,'' said Velimir Ilic, the mayor of Cacak, an industrial town of 80,000 people. Later Sunday, about 10,000 opposition supporters gathered at the main town square for a seventh consecutive night of anti-Milosevic rallies there. ``Our victory is as pure as a diamond,'' Ilic told the crowd. ``Kostunica is the elected president and we must persist in our resistance.'' He called for a total blockade of the town Monday. Opposition leader Milan Protic urged people to come out into the streets Monday, stay away from their jobs and keep their children away from school. Protic acknowledged that it would take time to build momentum among a public drained by years of conflict and economic misery. Protic, the opposition candidate for Belgrade mayor, said the protest leaders would try to escalate the tempo systematically ``until Milosevic realizes that he is no longer president. In Washington, the National Security Council spokesman P.J. Crowley said the Milosevic opposition is ``getting stronger.'' ``They are sending a strong message to Milosevic: `Your time in office is over,''' he said. But the cautious pace of the opposition's campaign raises questions about whether they will have the momentum to carry out their threats of bringing the entire country to a complete standstill. Authorities in Yugoslavia's main republic, Serbia, warned students against joining the Monday strike, saying ``events disrupting school activities'' for political purposes ``are illegal.'' Students in Nis and other cities walked out of class during protests last week. International pressure continued to build on Milosevic, who had rejected an offer of high-level mediation by close ally Russia. The president of neighboring Romania, Emil Constantinescu, urged Milosevic to concede defeat and congratulated Kostunica for his ``historic victory.'' Opposition leaders, using figures from their poll watchers, claim Kostunica won the election with 51.34 percent to 36.22 percent for Milosevic. But the Federal Electoral Commission, in a tally criticized by the United States and other countries, says Kostunica fell short of the majority needed to avoid a runoff. Even Russian President Vladimir Putin _ one of Milosevic's last major allies _ appeared to move toward the Western view that the Yugoslav leader was finished. In Berlin, the German government said Putin and Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder spoke by telephone late Saturday and agreed that ``Kostunica's election victory emphatically expresses the will of the Serbian people for a democratic change in Yugoslavia.'' There was no comment from the Russians, and the foreign ministry Sunday repeated Moscow's position that Yugoslavs should ``decide for themselves'' the outcome of the election. Milosevic turned down an offer by Putin to send his foreign minister, Igor Ivanov, to Belgrade to meet with both sides. But two senior Russian diplomats _ Vladimir Chizhov and Alexander Tolkach _ arrived in Serbia late Saturday. The state Tanjug news agency reported Chizov visited Kosovo on Sunday and was to have official meetings in Belgrade the following day.

Slobodan Milosevic's gift was an ability to persuade Serbs that someone was out to get them _ and that much of the world was in on the plot. For more than a decade, he presided over an ever-shrinking Yugoslavia that lost four consecutive wars, became an international pariah and chased away its educated elite. Still, even as they descended into poverty, Serbs believed Milosevic was defending their honor against enemies who included Islamic fundamentalists, the pope and President Clinton. The Serb leader, as a result, won elections that were more or less fair. Last week, though, the well of nationalist delusion ran dry. A majority of voters decided that Milosevic himself was dishonoring Serbia, according to an opposition vote count backed by the United States and the European Union. Even the official vote count, managed by his loyalists, conceded that more Serbs (though just short of 50 percent) were against him than were for him. That left only the question of how long he could survive the contempt of a proud people who knew that he tried to steal the election, or how long he could keep the backing of a long-resentful army that has borne the brunt of his lost wars. Yet, whatever the outcome of the struggle to force him to accept electoral defeat, one thing was clear: The logic of Milosevic's hold on the people of Serbia had been shattered. Much of the world had already taken to calling Milosevic a dictator, based on his manipulation of the apparatus of power. But many Serbs didn't see it that way, since he didn't terrorize them and could win elections based on the fiction that he was protecting them from the sea of enemies. Now, by doctoring the results of last Sunday's election, refusing to accept defeat and demanding a second round of voting, the populist demagogue revealed himself to his countrymen as a tyrant hiding behind the trappings of democracy. What was so different about this election? For the first time, Milosevic did not have a handy aggressive nationalist neighbor he could demonize, and even lead Serbs to war against, as a diversion from their own troubles. And the opposition movement inside Serbia, after years of egotistical infighting, had finally figured out how to pull together. Milosevic's loss of legitimacy in Serbia is difficult to understand without a quick look back at how he cemented his populist base in the first place. As communism came crashing down in Eastern Europe in the late 1980s, Milosevic, a relatively unknown party functionary, stumbled upon a survival strategy. During a spring visit in 1987 to the Serbian province of Kosovo, where Serbs had been complaining of mistreatment at the hands of Kosovar Albanians, he broke with a party policy that suppressed nationalistic conflicts. Ignoring the explosive impact of his behavior in a federal Yugoslav state of six republics, three religions and two alphabets, he promised Serbs that they would come first, that no one would mistreat them again. During 1989, a year in which all of Eastern Europe's other communist leaders were being tossed out of office, jailed or shot, Milosevic was riding high as Serbia's president. Weeping Serbian women kissed his official photograph at political rallies as his police stripped Albanians in Kosovo of political rights they had been guaranteed in Tito's Yugoslavia. Milosevic plugged into long-simmering resentments among Serbs, who felt that their status as Yugoslavia's largest ethnic group had never been shown proper respect. Many Serbs, too, shared an abiding feeling of victimization, dating back through 500 years of Ottoman rule and punctuated by their murderous treatment during World War II by Nazis and Croat fascists. Milosevic and the Serbs, however, were not simply remembering or inventing enemies. The splintering of Yugoslavia in the early 1990s left about 2 million Serbs outside Serbia, making them, in effect, minorities in foreign countries. In Croatia, Serbs were bullied, fired from state jobs and sometimes killed. The late Croatian President Franjo Tudjman, a puffed-up nationalist eager to expand the borders of his new country, was made to order for Milosevic. The Croat's witless posturing left the Serbs itching for war. As in all of Milosevic's wars, which started off strong and ended in ignominious Serb retreat, Tudjman's side ended up winning. When there was little to inflame the Serb paranoia that Milosevic needed to remain popular, his regime used state television and radio to manufacture it. Belgrade television showcased terribly mutilated bodies during the Bosnian war, which newscasters described as Serbs butchered by Muslims. The Serb siege of Sarajevo was explained on Belgrade radio as Muslims laying siege to themselves, to win sympathy from the West.

Navies from the United States, Japan, South Korea and Singapore on Monday began the first combined submarine rescue exercise in the Pacific. The 13-day Exercise Pacific Reach 2000 involves 600 people, four ships, four submarines and three sophisticated underwater devices that can rescue personnel from submarines in distress. The joint exercise in the South China Sea off Singapore was planned nearly two years before the recent Russian submarine disaster that killed 118 people, but participants said the disaster heightened the importance of submarine rescue. ``This is the first time we've really had the chance to work together in a regional submarine rescue exercise in the Pacific,'' said Lt. Leslie Hull-Ryde, a Navy spokeswoman in Singapore. The navies' working together will promote ``greater understanding and also a commitment to stability'' in the Asia-Pacific region, Hull-Ryde said. The Navy has begun venturing into shallower coastal waters and will use the exercise to test its shallow-water rescue capabilities, said Navy Capt. C.J. Leidig, deputy coordinator of the exercise. ``We are looking to operate in more shallow waters in recent years as we make the transition from a Cold War, blue-water navy to a more littoral (coastal) type strategy, so shallow water submarine rescue has become important,'' Leidig said. Exercise Pacific Reach is taking place in about 231 feet to 264 feet of water _ considered shallow for submarines _ Leidig told a news conference Monday. Russia, China, Britain, Australia, Canada, Chile and Indonesia have sent observers to this week's exercise 230 miles northeast of Singapore. During the exercise, some of the submarines will sit on the bottom ``simulating disabled subs,'' Leidig said. Underwater rescue devices such as a Navy high-tech ``diving bell'' will be attached to the submarines' hatches and transfer crew to the rescue vehicle. Special diving suits will also be used. The U.S. Navy nuclear attack submarine USS Helena is taking part, along with submarines JDS Akishio of Japan, South Korea's ROKS Choi Moo Sun and Singapore's RSS Conqueror. Japan, South Korea and Singapore are sending rescue support ships to the exercise, while the United States, Japan and South Korea are sending underwater rescue vehicles. Japan's equivalent of a naval force is officially referred to as the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force. Since Japan was defeated in World War II and formally renounced military aggression, its armed forces are constitutionally limited to a self-defense role. Submarine emergencies grabbed world attention in August when Russia's Kursk nuclear submarine sank after an explosion. Russian officials, including President Vladimir Putin, were criticized for slow and awkward handling of the incident.

This is The World, a co-production of the BBC World Service, PRI and WGBH in Boston.I am Lisa Mullins. Eight days after Yugoslavs voted for President, the power struggle in Belgrade is only intensifying. Today President Slobodan Milosevic appeared on TV to affirm that there will be a second round of elections and to accuse his critics of selling out to the west. While Milosevic has the state controlled media to back him up, Vojislav Kostunica seems to have the majority of Serbs behind him. Today demonstrators continued to demand that Milosevic step down and Kostunica step up. Our coverage begins with the latest from The World's Jennifer Glass in Yugoslavia. This morning opposition supporters in Belgrade said they would do whatever it takes to make Vojislav Kostunica President. We are going to be persistent in our demands to prove that Mr. Kostunica has won this presidential elections and that we won't give up our demands. Well we here are looking at all in the city, I hope that during the day we will be looking at the whole city, Belgrade and also in Soviet. They didn't quite do that but demonstrators did disrupt traffic in Belgrade and trash collectors and public transport workers blocked streets forcing commuters to walk to work. Protesters also blocked the main rail line from the capital to the coast. And today more coal miners joined the general strike. Tusca Antasiaovich of Belgrade's Ramiye newspaper says the shutdown of the Colobora mine in particular could provoke trouble with the police. The miners they have responded to the appeal by the allied opposition and began striking. And because this mine is very, very crucial for the electricity production the country, we've heard that significant police forces mounting around the mines still at a safe distance and still not disturbing the miners. But apparently we may expect further confrontation in that area. To counter Kostunica's supporters Milosevic is using one of the few weapons still under his control - state run television. Today he used the medium to address the Serbian people and to attack his opponents. At this moment, ahead of the second round of presidential elections, because of the doubts that the Democratic opposition of Serbia has in its ability to achieve a result which it needs, members of the top Serbian leadership with money brought into the country have been bribing, blackmailing and intimidating citizens and are now organizing strikes, unrest and violence in order to stop production and all industrial activity. Nationalism was a key theme as Milosevic attacked the west for last year's Nato bombing and for what he called Nato's puppet regime in Kosovo. Western nations, he said, are to blame for unrest in the region. They do not want peace and prosperity in the Balkans. They want this to be a zone of constant conflicts which would give them an alibi for a permanent presence here. A puppet regime guarantees violence, potentially many years of war. This regime would bring anything but peace. Only our policy guarantees peace . That could be a veiled threat that if Milosevic loses he will fight with whatever forces he can still command. The speech could also be laying the groundwork for President Milosevic to declare a state of Emergency, another way he could hold on to power. For The World I'm Jennifer Glass in Podgorica, Yugoslavia. Meanwhile, Russia today resisted Western pressure to get Milosevic to concede defeat. Vladimir Putin said he is willing to receive Milosevic and Kostunica in Moscow to quote 'discuss ways of resolving the situation.' But then the Russian President took off for a four-day visit to India, suggesting no meeting is likely before the run off vote. The World's Nenad Chebeck is in Moscow now. How do you read the signals from Moscow, Nenad? One the one hand, we have heard statements prior to today with Moscow recognizing Kostunica as the rightful President and now we are hearing more critical statements. What do you read them as? Well, judging by what we heard Putin said that he wanted to see the two candidates for the second round of elections. So in an oblique way Putin has actually not taken Milosevic's side but he has sort of recognized the fact that there will be a second round of elections for the Presidency of Yugoslavia, which is far from what either of the Serbian opposition leaders wanted to hear or from what the Western leaders wanted to hear. They wanted to hear explicit support from Moscow for Kostunica that's not coming. The question is why it is not coming? And I wonder if you can call on some of your years of reporting out of Belgrade as well, including during the NATO bombing. At that time of course we heard that line that Russia and Serbia are traditional allies. But I wonder if that has changed and we are seeing the evidence of that change now. Well, Russia and Serbia do have some historical ties. They have the same common, orthodox faith. But Russia has never in any decisive moment actually stood by Serbia and helped it. So in a way although these traditional ties are there, Russia has never actually risked its reputation or its standing to stand by Milosevic's side or by the side of Serbia as a state. So then why is it important who Moscow supports in this election? Well, it's very important because Russia is seen as a decisive factor who could sort of possibly try and mediate in this crisis and somehow persuade Milosevic to leave. But Russia is trying to sort of back off and not take a very decisive stand for a couple of reasons. First of all, it does want to be an important player on one side but on the other hand it's got to offer something to Milosevic if it wants to sort of use him to sort of step down. The West is not helping by insisting on a War Crimes trial for Milosevic. So Russia sort of needs to look carefully at sort of what it can actually offer to Milosevic, some kind of a carrot. And there is no carrot which seems to be on the plate at the moment. There is indeed pressure coming from Washington. Can you tell us about some of the high level contact that's been made between Washington and Moscow? Well, last weekend President Clinton phoned Russia's President Vladimir Putin and they spoke about the crisis in Yugoslavia. From what we hear from the White House President Clinton was very anxious to hear some very decisive words of support for Kostunica and indeed in that conversation President Putin did sort of take that kind of a line. But today's statement before he left for India by President Putin definitely is not what Washington was anxious to hear. Do we know what Moscow makes of Milosevic and what it thinks of Kostunica, the opponent? Moscow is taking a sort of wait and see kind of an attitude. On the one hand it does recognize that Milosevic is a man of the past. For example we had last night the Head of the powerful Russian Security Council who said that Belgrade needs a President who is recognized by the world but certainly not Milosevic. On the other hand what Russia fears is that whilst with Milosevic it does have some leverage, if Kostunica came into power they might see the same kind of thing that they have seen in Hungary, in Poland, in the Czech Republic, in all the other Eastern block countries who once they've freed themselves from Russian control have taken a decisively pro-western attitude and indeed some of them have become members of NATO. Russia feels as if Yugoslavia, its sort of almost only ally it's got in that part of Europe, and it feels that it has more leverage over Milosevic than it might have over Kostunica. I don't think they'll be sorry to see Milosevic go but at this stage they are still not prepared to put their weight behind any one of the two candidates. Speaking to us from Moscow, The World's Nenad Chebeck..

Serbia remains tense today in the wake of a massive civil disobedience campaign begun Monday to force President Slobodan Milosevic to concede election defeat. In nearly every Serbian city protestors marched in the streets demanding Mr. Milosevic recognize opposition candidate Vojislav Kostunica as the outright winner of last week's presidential election. Banks, coal mines and other institutions shut down as workers protested a second runoff election scheduled for this Sunday. Mr. Milosevic accuses his opponents of using blackmail and bribery to organize the work stoppages that have brought much of Serbia to a standstill. At a news conference in Belgrade, the President said Yugoslavia would face foreign occupation if Mr. Kostunica came to power. The Clinton administration is clear on its view on the Milosevic move. White House Spokesman Jake Sewart. He belongs out of power, out of Serbia and at the International Tribunal. We will do everything we can to make sure that he makes his court date there.

Slobodan Milosevic's government threatened to crack down Tuesday on opposition supporters in Yugoslavia, calling them subversive elements waging special warfare against the country and trying to trigger chaos. The new measures, which included directives to force miners in the Kolubara coal mine complex to return to work, suggest the government could use force against those it accuses of ``threatening life and property.'' In a statement, the government also threatened to shut down ``media which are financed from abroad and are trying to trigger unrest by spreading lies and initiating bloodshed'' _ a clear reference to Serbia's fledgling independent media. The moves came after Yugoslavia's army chief, Gen. Nebojsa Pavkovic, urged striking coal miners to return to work, marking the first time Milosevic called on the country's military to help end current protests aimed at ousting him. Pavkovic is considered one of the most loyal allies of Milosevic, who used the military in 1991 to put down massive street riots against his rule. The general's unprecedented negotiating efforts to resolve the impasse at Kolubara came as a second day of blockades, strikes and walkouts gripped Yugoslavia. After the general failed to resolve the impasse, the government struck back at opposition-run cities and towns across country by introducing four-hour power cuts allegedly triggered by the coal strike. By noon Tuesday, parts of capital Belgrade, as well as Serbia's second and third largest cities, Nis and Novi Sad, and three other towns were without electricity. The army talks with the miners came in the wake of Milosevic's lambasting of opposition leaders, labeling them puppets of the West. The Yugoslav president's challengers staged protests around the country to press him to concede defeat in recent elections. Milosevic admits opposition candidate Vojislav Kostunica won more votes but says he fell short of a majority, meaning a second round runoff will be held Sunday. The opposition insists that Kostunica won outright, a claim supported by the United States and Western European governments; Kostunica has said he will not participate in any runoff. The campaign of civil disobedience has involved hundred of thousands of people and represented the most serious challenge yet to Milosevic's 13-year rule. The protests even reached his hometown of Pozarevac, where 20,000 massed Monday on main roads. By daylight Tuesday, convoys of trucks and private cars cut off traffic for two hours just outside of the capital, Belgrade. High school students blocked Belgrade's Slavija square with garbage containers _ as police displaying batons watched _ and tens of thousands of opposition supporters marched to the statistics bureau, which counted the votes from last month's election. Marchers chanted, ``Thieves! Thieves!'' Belgrade police turned back two opposition convoys en route to block a key bridge north of the capital and the main highway leading to the west of the city _ the first sign Milosevic's security forces were getting nervous. A cordon of riot police stopped about 50,000 people who tried to march in the direction of Milosevic's exclusive Dedinje district. Protesters went on marching in another direction. Another road leading into the capital was blocked near Mount Avala, just south of Belgrade, and barricades remained up around the central town of Cacak where almost all shops remained shut with signs ``Closed Because of Robbery'' _ referring to Milosevic's stealing of the elections _ posted on the windows. One of the country's main highways was also closed early Tuesday, the state Tanjug agency said. The state bus company rerouted regular bus lines to avoid the blockades. Police arrested two trade unionists in Belgrade's bus company Tuesday morning, radio Index reported. Striking railroad workers cut ties linking Yugoslavia's dominant republic, Serbia, with its smaller republic, Montenegro. Buses traveled only to the border of the two republics. Chris Patten, the European Union's foreign affairs commissioner, said Tuesday that he hoped the popular backlash against Milosevic will prove ``irreversible.'' ``I suppose he may be able to hang on by his fingertips but I think the writing is on the wall now,'' Patten said in an interview with BBC radio. ``The brave people of Serbia have made their views pretty clear.'' The opposition called for people to rally in Belgrade on Thursday, in a final push to drive Milosevic from power.

The Norwegian subsidiary of a U.S. firm run until recently by Dick Cheney will help recover the remains of the 118 seamen who died in the sinking of the Russian nuclear submarine Kursk. The contract for the retrieval operations was awarded Monday to the Tananger, Norway branch of Halliburton Co., the Dallas-based oil services firm. Cheney was Halliburton's chief executive from 1995 until August, when he resigned to become the GOP vice presidential nominee. Representatives of the company's Tananger branch signed the contract Monday with the Rubin military design bureau, which designed the Kursk. Igor Spassky, the head of Rubin, told a news conference in St. Petersburg that the retrieval work would begin about Oct. 18. He said it would be impossible to bring back all the remains, since most of the compartments in the shattered submarine were destroyed in the Aug. 12 disaster. ``We expect that we'll be able to retrieve 20 to 30 percent of the crew in this operation, which would be a very good result,'' Spassky said. ``The rest we will have to bury after we raise the sub itself.'' Neither side would say how much the contract is worth, though Rubin had reportedly offered $9 million to another Norwegian company, Stolt Offshore, to take part in the operation. That deal fell through. Authorities still have not determined what caused the explosions and sinking of the Kursk, which went down during military exercises. Russian officials say the most likely scenario was a collision with a foreign submarine. But the United States, which has acknowledged that its submarines were monitoring the military exercises, has denied that. American officials say the Kursk may have gone down after a torpedo misfire.

Escalating the Yugoslav crisis, President Slobodan Milosevic's embattled government threatened for the first time Tuesday to arrest leaders of the nationwide strikes seeking to drive him from office. But the strikes appeared to spread in the second day of the protests aimed at forcing Milosevic to accept that he lost the Sept. 24 elections to Vojislav Kostunica and step down. Instead, Milosevic has called a runoff election for Sunday _ which the opposition has repeatedly rejected. Police in the southern town of Vranje dispersed about 2,000 protesters, and opposition officials said dozens were arrested Tuesday. They were promptly sentenced to between 10 and 30 days in jail for taking part in the work stoppages and road blocks, the opposition coalition reported. Milosevic dispatched the army's chief of staff, Gen. Nebojsa Pavkovic, to the Kolubara coal mine south of Belgrade to demand that strikers return to work. It marked the first time Milosevic has used the military in any role during the current crisis. But the miners, who supply coal to a major Yugoslav power plant at Obrenovac, told the general they would remain on strike until Milosevic accepts that he lost the presidential election. The government immediately struck back by introducing four-hour power cuts to opposition-controlled cities, blaming the strikers for a shortage of coal. In the apparent broadening of strikes, workers at a key copper mine in the southern town of Majdanpek walked off the job. They parked dump trucks at the mine gates and unloaded dirt and rocks to build barricades, the private Beta news agency reported. The government warned in a televised statement that it would not tolerate ``violent behavior,'' which disrupts vital institutions and threatens lives. ``Special measures will be taken against the organizers of these criminal activities,'' the government said, clearly threatening opposition leaders with arrest. ``These measures also apply to media that are financed from abroad and are breeding lies, untruths and inciting bloodshed.'' The opposition has called for people to rally in Belgrade on Thursday, in a final push to drive Milosevic from power and has repeatedly rejected taking part in a run-off Sunday, convinced that the president would cheat again. ``No one has the right to so bluntly annul the people's will,'' Kostunica said. ``If we did that we would betray the will of the voters.'' In Belgrade, about 20,000 people chanting ``the police are with us'' marched toward Milosevic's residence in the exclusive Dedinje district. Hundreds of riot police turned them away without incident, allowing the crowd to march down a major highway dividing the capital. Protesters lit fires and overturned garbage bins. High school students blocked Belgrade downtown squares with garbage containers and tens of thousands opposition supporters marched to the government statistics bureau, which counted the votes from last month's election. ``Thieves! Thieves!'' marchers chanted. Barricades remained up around the central town of Cacak where almost all shops remained shut. Merchants displayed signs in the windows proclaiming: ``Closed Because of Robbery,'' alluding to the contested vote count. Striking railroad workers cut lines from Serbia to Yugoslavia's smaller republic, Montenegro. Elsewhere, some 30,000 people marched through the second-largest city of Novi Sad. In Nis, about 400 workers walked out a tobacco factory, carrying a huge photograph of Milosevic draped in black cloth as a sign of mourning. ``All Serbs know by now that Milosevic lost the elections _ except the electoral commission,'' Nis Mayor Zoran Zivkovic told 10,000 people at a rally. Despite the public outcry, Milosevic remained defiant. His spokesman, Nikola Sainovic, accused the opposition of ``brutally lying'' in its claims to have won the first-round balloting. ``They want chaos in the streets in order to trigger foreign intervention,'' Sainovic said.

The Serbian government issued a harsh warning to the democratic opposition on Tuesday, promising ``special measures'' and prosecutions against those organizing a spreading general strike intended to oust Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic. The statement, read on state television, heralded a counterattack on political leaders who are organizing the strikes to support Milosevic's challenger, Vojislav Kostunica, and on the independent news media reporting on the effort. Early Tuesday, the police arrested the head of the public-transport trade union, Dragoljub Stosic, and ordered protesters to clear away their obstacles blocking the bus garage. The government also said it would seek the arrest of 11 organizers of a coal miners' strike at Kolubara. State television said that two opposition politicians who have helped the strikers, Nebojsa Covic and Boris Tadic, would also face charges. The opposition is trying to force Milosevic to concede an outright, first-round electoral victory to Kostunica, who says that only massive government vote fraud denied him the presidency in elections on Sept. 24. Milosevic is organizing a second-round runoff for Sunday that Kostunica vows to boycott, saying a runoff is unnecessary. In its statement on Tuesday, the government said, ``The violent behavior of individuals and groups that threatens citizens' lives, disrupts normal functioning of traffic, prevents normal work of industry, schools, institutions and health facilities will be proscribed by law. ``Special measures will be taken against the organizers of these criminal activities,'' the government said. The strike continued to spread on Tuesday. About 50,000 students were turned back peacefully after marching toward Milosevic's home outside Belgrade. At least 30,000 people rallied in Novi Sad, and 10,000 gathered in Nis, two towns that are opposition strongholds. And 50,000 people in Kragujevac came to hear Kostunica speak.

This is the World, I'm Lisa Mullins. For those who interpreted the recent increased contacts between Israeli and Palestinian leaders as progress toward peace, the events of the past 6 days have been a brutal reality check. For many on both sides, peace is no longer a realistic or even a desirable goal. Since violence broke out Thursday, at least 55 people have been killed in the Palestinian territory and in Israel's Arab towns. As the World's Richard Myron reports, the day began with a glimmer of hope as cease-fire agreement reached between Israeli and Palestinian commanders. The cease-fire was meant to bring a temporary peace to the troubled West Bank and Gaza Strip, but it didn't last long and within hours the conflict reignited. In the Gaza Strip, Palestinian police and Israeli soldiers exchanged automatic gunfire. At one point the Israeli helicopter gunship were brought in to join the battle. Both sides blame each other for the fighting. The Israelis say the Palestinians aren't doing enough to rein in their security forces and the rioters. But the Palestinian authority insists the situation is now out of control and it can't do anything more to hold the violence. The Israeli government is unconvinced and Cabinet Secretary Isaac Hertzsog says the Palestinians must do more. How can a normal Western viewer decide whether the Palestinian authority has the capability of honoring its commitments of going into an agreement about its future when the things of this nature take place. We expect the Palestinian authority to put a hold to this at once. Thousands of Palestinians gathered today throughout the West Bank and Gaza Strip to bury their dead killed in the fighting. The increasing death toll is fueling the rising tide of anger. Palestinian authority spokesman Mollin Kanafoni says that the presence of the Israeli army close to Palestinian towns and villages is provoking the protesters. The problem is that the Israeli army is surrounding the cities and the presence of the Israeli army, of course, you know calls for the presence of protesters. Since their police with the Israeli army withdrew back to the positions they were at, I don't think there will be any problem for the time being. The fact is that the Israeli army, since Friday is conducting a plan of direct shoot against demonstrators, against children, against even the Palestinian Security forces. At a traffic junction on the edge of Ramallah, Israeli troops fire rubber bullets on a crowd of Palestinians. This spot has become a flash point between the army and the rioters. Just a mile up the road from the trouble, accountant Tuvia Victor sits in his office in the Jewish settlement of Betow. Victor says that the daily disturbances are now beginning to take on the appearance of a war. I have been expecting the end of the peace process to be a war. So if you ask if I am surprised and what do I think, I kind of expected it to come. If it doesn't come now, it's going to come later, so I don't see the peace process leading towards eventual peace. I think that this is just a indication of the war that's still going to come. Some settlers like Tuvia Victor's neighbor, Avy Dobulla believe the army isn't acting strongly enough against the rioters. Dobulla believes the settlers themselves should take action to protect their homes and families. So long as we feel more and more in danger, there is greater and greater pressure to be preemptive, to be proactive instead of reactive, and if the army won't do what they have to do to provide for our security then against our will, then we will be forced to be preemptive. But local Palestinians say they are the ones who need to be protected against the extremists in the Jewish settlements. Hussain Allawi is head of the council of the Jeluzoon Refugee Camp near Ramallah. We Palestinians, he says, don't have any power. We don't have any weapons unlike the settlers who are protected by planes and tanks. They have their army, he says. We can't attack them. How could the weak attack the strong? But now familiar scenes of fighting don't show any signs of lessening up and as the situation continues, so it threatens to reel further out of control. For The World, this is Richard Myron in Jerusalem. The Israeli army today said that investigation is going on into the killing of a Palestinian boy in Gaza on Saturday and that it's possible Israeli troops were responsible. The child's death was captured on video. You may well have seen the footage on TV or the pictures in the newspapers if you haven't you may not want to. The boy was shot while cowering in fear in his father's arms. Lee Hawk Seder is Jerusalem Bureau Chief for the Washington Post. Lee Hawk Seder, what do you know about this internal investigation and how did the army reach this conclusion? The army acknowledged today, the Israeli army acknowledged today that it was most likely responsible for the shooting of the boy. They said it was in the context of a shootout with Palestinian forces in the Gaza Strip and it's probably important to point out that since then there have been many other deaths, including boys of the same age, more or less, and even younger. In fact there was a 2-year-old Palestinian who was riddled with bullets yesterday. This one grabbed the international attention because of the very dramatic footage that we have all seen on television. And how has that footage been received in Israel? Has it softened at all public opinion there? Not particularly, in fact among Palestinians, of course, it's probably set the violence to a very large extent. Among Israelis, there is a more subtle and complex mixture of reactions. On one hand, there is compassion for a young boy being killed, but as I said, he is one of many young boys who have been killed in the last few days. And on the other hand, many Israelis see it as something that will simply produce a public relations advantage for the Palestinians, which they would view without great sympathy. There is a second image that seems to be shaping world opinion on this and that's the image that sparked this violence, the image of Ariel Sharon, of the opposition Likud party at the Temple Mount accompanied by about a 1,000 riot police. This kind of thing doesn't happen without approval, especially if you are going to be bringing 1,000 armed police along with you. Do we know who gave Sharon permission to go to the Temple Mount? Sure, it was a government decision. Ultimately, Prime Minister Barak's decision to allow him to go there. Is this something that people are questioning him very closely out? I mean, how could it have gotten that high and how could he have given an approval to it? Well, the Israeli government's position, and a Jewish position in an even broader sense, is that the Temple Mount is the very most holy site in all of Judaism. And so for the government of Israel to prevent the leader of the opposition party from touring that holy site at Judaism would have been a pretty tall order. In the past, the government has barred certain individuals from going on to the Temple Mount for security reasons and perhaps in high inside, the government is being criticized very strongly for permitting this to happen because it did indeed represent a security threat like even when Sharon was up there, there were problems right after he left. But I think, politically, the government would have a hard time justifying keeping Mr. Sharon from going up on the Mount. Israeli forces are using anti-tank missiles and helicopter gunships. Is anyone in Israel concerned about the over use of firepower against the Palestinians? Well, this imbalance you refer to is symptomatic of the general balance of power in the Holy Land. Israel, of course, is a first rate military power and the Palestinians are third world, disorganized, rabble in general, who do have weapons so they are not unthreatening. So are the Israelis concerned? Well, they don't like the public relations system to taking internationally, clearly. However, there are a lot of Israelis who think that the use of force should actually be expanded and intensified. They are others who are pressing for restraint. There is was a debate going on here, but clearly the government is in no mood to withdraw their the forces. And so the Palestinian and Israeli-Arab casualties continue to mount. Lee Hawk Seder, our Jerusalem bureau Chief for the Washington Post. Thank you for the update Lee. Thanks for having me.

In Yugoslavia today Serbian authorities and protestors drew the battle line to more firmly than at any other time since September 24th. That's when Yugoslavs voted for President, favoring the opposition candidate Vojislav Kostunica over the incumbent Slobodan Milosevic. President Milosevic, claiming that Kostunica fell short of 50 percent, insists that a runoff round of voting will be held this Sunday. The opposition maintains that Kostunica won outright and he staged demonstrations and strikes to force Milosevic from office. Today the government vowed to act firmly to end the strikes but the protestors are not backing down, and neither is the man they want as Yugoslavia's next President. The West knows little about Kostunica than what he would do as President. So for some insight we turn now to Wisnep Pessage who is the director of the center for Anti-War action in Belgrade. She has worked closely with Kostunica in the opposition for some 20 years now. Wisnep Pessage, this man is a Serb nationalist but in anti-Communist and a longtime foe of Milosevic. How would the Federal Republic of Yugaslavia be different under Kostunica than it is under Milosevic? I think that Kostunica would change our situation in a real popular way because during his years we didn't have any rule of law. We had, let's say, on the edge of complete and open dictatorship. We live in a country where we have this Mafia's style, where you have people making money overnight and what is for sure about Kostunica that I can say is that he is not right for anything and that the people liked him because he is honest. He is going to respect the Parliament that will change our constitution that everybody is participating in that. So he would reconstruct his first, you know, the basics of democracy. So how would he, for instance, handle the situation in Kosovo? And how would he have handled it differently than Milosevic? First of all, you know, he would use more legal means, you know, to resolve the problem. I think that he should use, you know, negotiations and probably would negotiate some kind of autonomy. If, for example, now he is in his campaign he was advocating the solution with the problem with Montenegro that we have referendum in Serbia and also in Montenegro, and then also that we have negotiation about the constitution and the possession of Balk Republic in the Federation. Let's look outward now. I mean this is the man that the West is counting on working with. He is still, as we said, very much an unknown quantity. What should international governments know about him? What should Washington know about him? One of his primary goals is to have good relationship with Western Europe, to have good relationship with United States. And at the beginning he was stressing more Europe than United States, because there is more odium against, you know, America. But since the time was passing by, he was putting that together, Europe and United States, and actually I don't think that he is having to anything against to have very good relationship with United States, and America, and also Russia. Can you see a reconciliation, for instance, with some of Serbia's enemies? Would he visit, for instance, Croatia? Well, I am sure that he would. You know, for President Milosevic congratulated him and Kostunica is a very, how to say, elegant and let's say nobleman. I don't think that he would behave rudely and I am sure that he would have a good relationship with our neighbors and that's what we need. One of the stated conditions of the West for lifting the sanctions, full lifting of the sanctions in Yugoslavia, is this Slobodan Milosevic be handed over to The Hague. Would Kostunica turn over Milosevic to The Hague war-crimes tribunal? Well, up to now he refused to do that. He said that he would not do that. Then he softened this position and then he said that this kind of thing is not his duty so some other people should be deciding about that. I think that this a premature question for Kostunica because the trouble is that he is not President yet. And I would suggest, you know, that we don't push such questions before he really is the President. Wisnip Pessage, opposition campaigner and longtime colleague to Vojislav of Kostunica speaking to us from Belgrade. Nice to speak with you. Thank you very much. Thank you very much too.

The United States would expect Russia to turn over Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to an international war crimes tribunal if he should show up in Moscow, the Clinton administration said Tuesday. ``There's an indictment that calls for any country to hand him over to The Hague (tribunal),'' State Department spokesman Philip Reeker said. ``That's very clear, including Russia. ... We expect the indictment to be followed.'' He refused to say whether the United States would apply pressure to force Russia to send Milosevic to the tribunal if he went to Moscow. Reeker said the question is a hypothetical one ``that I don't need to get into'' because he said he's seen reports Milosevic will not go. ``It's not an issue for us,'' he said. On Monday, Russian President Vladimir Putin invited Milosevic and his challenger, Vojislav Kostunica, to Moscow for talks to resolve their dispute over the Sept. 24 presidential election. Kostunica says he won; Milosevic wants a runoff election Sunday. Asked how Putin's offer to mediate could take shape if the moment Milosevic showed up he would face extradition to the Hague, Reeker said: ``That's a question for Putin and Milosevic to discuss.'' ``We believe (Milosevic) should be out of power, out of Serbia and in The Hague to face justice. Period,'' Reeker said. Milosevic was indicted last summer for alleged atrocities in the Serbian province of Kosovo. Kostunica has criticized the United States for repeatedly insisting on the hand-over of Milosevic because it was turning the elections into a question of the Yugoslav president's physical survival. ``That indictment brings us a lot of headache,'' Kostunica said Monday at a news conference in Belgrade.'' It helped convince Milosevic, Kostunica said, that ``for him these elections are a question of life or death.'' In fact, Kostunica said, they are not. He and his aides have said not only would they refuse to extradite Milosevic but they also would guarantee his safety.

Soldiers pulled over cars escorting the wife of Ivory Coast's main opposition leader Tuesday and arrested some of her bodyguards, in a move activists called an attempt to harass the opposition. Opposition officials claimed the soldiers had been trying to kidnap Dominique Ouattara, the wife of opposition leader Alassane Dramane Ouattara. But the ruling military junta said the operation targeted the arrested bodyguards, who it claimed were trying to destabilize the government. More than 20 soldiers stopped a series of cars escorting Dominique Ouattara near her downtown office, said Aly Coulibaly, a spokesman for the Rally of the Republicans. Her driver sped away, and the soldiers seized five of her bodyguards _ including two French citizens _ and two drivers. In a statement, Coulibaly accused the government of harassing Ouattara and his wife in recent weeks, saying the acts could deteriorate ``the climate of peace and serenity necessary'' before Oct. 22 presidential elections. Communications Minister Henri Cesar Sama, in a bitter verbal counterattack on national television, claimed the arrested men had been recruiting thugs to destabilize the Ivory Coast. Ouattara's party ``has threatened to occupy the streets and create acts of violence,'' he said, warning that opposition leaders were under surveillance by authorities. ``If Ivory Coast burns, we are all going to burn together,'' he said. Tensions have been building in recent weeks as this West African nation moves toward the presidential vote. Supporters of junta leader Gen. Robert Guei claim that Ouattara's origins are in Burkina Faso, the neighboring northern state, and is ineligible to run in the race under a junta-backed constitution voted in last month. Ouattara, a former prime minister and ex-International Monetary Fund official, insists both he and his parents were Ivorian-born. Scores of Ouattara's supporters have surrounded his house day and night for more than a week, fearing a move against him by the junta. Guei came to power after a December military coup, the first in the history of the 40-year-old nation. The coup, and two military uprisings since then, have shaken the country's standing as a valued center of stability in troubled West Africa.

Taiwanese President Chen Shui-bian moved swiftly to replace his resigning premier Wednesday, picking a longtime member of his party to take over as the island's No. 3 ranking leader. Chen picked Vice Premier Chang Chun-hsiung to replace Tang Fei, a presidential spokesman said during a news conference. Tang quit Tuesday night, saying his declining health prevented him from keeping the job. The choice of Chang, a lawyer and former lawmaker with the president's Democratic Progressive Party, marks the president's abandonment of an effort to find a nonpartisan premier who could bridge differences in the legislature. The Taiwanese premier is the third most powerful member of the government behind the president and vice president, and one of his main responsibilities is to push the administration's policies in the island's unruly, fiercely partisan legislature. After announcing the new premier, the presidential office said that there would be a minor Cabinet shuffle. Finance Minister Shea Jia-dong was one of those being replaced, said Chang, who did not name a successor. ``The president urged opposition parties to join him to discuss national affairs and to give up their differences,'' presidential spokesman Chen Che-nan said. Many political experts applauded Chen when he appointed Tang premier about four months ago. Tang, a longtime member of the former ruling Nationalist Party, was expected to help smooth relations with Nationalist lawmakers, who make up the majority in the legislature. But Tang was unable to win over the Nationalists, still vengeful after the party's defeat in the March presidential election. Before the vote, the party had controlled Taiwan's presidency for more than five decades. Chang could also have problems pleasing lawmakers. After the appointment was announced, Nationalist lawmaker Ting Shou-chung said he would not accept the DPP premier. The Nationalists and the People's First Party have the majority in the legislature and won't tolerate the president ``pushing his own way,'' Ting said. Shortly after accepting the premiership, Tang underwent surgery to remove a benign tumor from between his lungs. He struggled to recover from the operation and has complained of dizzy spells. Tang also disagreed with the president about whether Taiwan should finish constructing its fourth nuclear plant. The president's party has long opposed the project, but Tang favored completing it. Many believe the dispute was a key reason for Tang's departure. Smiling and looking relaxed Wednesday morning, Tang declined to discuss his resignation in detail. He told reporters that he had no regrets about his decision to serve as premier. Tang said he had served in the government for 49 years. ``I'm finished fighting my war,'' he said, prompting laughter from reporters. As Chen's government struggled to convince the public that it has a solid economic policy, Taiwan's stock market steadily declined, losing about 40 percent of its value since April. Vice Finance Minister Yen Ching-chang said he talked with Chang late Tuesday about the workings of Taiwan's financial markets. Yen said Chang's concern over the financial markets should give investors confidence in the new premier.

Slobodan Milosevic's police entered a major coal mine south of here Wednesday to break up one of the biggest strikes launched so far to drive the Yugoslav president from power, an independent news agency said. Truckloads of police and soldiers entered the Kolubara mine complex after the government said the five-day strike threatened electricity supplies, the independent Beta news agency said. A striker who answered the telephone at the facility said miners were refusing to leave the compound and so far there had been no clashes nor arrests. He refused to give his name. Beta quoted a strike leader Predgrag Stefanovic as appealing to residents of nearby towns ``to come and help us.''

Beta quoted a strike leader Predgrag Stefanovic as appealing to residents of nearby towns ``to come and help us.'' The action came one day after the Milosevic government threatened ``special measures'' against leaders of strikes and road blockades, which were launched this week to force the Yugoslav president to concede defeat to challenger Vojislav Kostunica in the Sept. 24 election. Milosevic concedes that Kostunica outpolled him in the five-candidate race but fell short of an absolute majority. A run-off is set for Sunday but the opposition has called for a boycott. Earlier, police arrested several truck drivers blocking roads in Milosevic's hometown Pozarevac about 30 miles southeast of Belgrade. Beta said the government had brought in strikebreakers from Kosovo, where many miners are out of work since NATO and the United Nations took over the province last year. The opposition has accused Milosevic of massive fraud in the election and on Wednesday sought to prove the allegations before Yugoslavia's Constitutional Court. The tribunal met in emergency session to hear claims by the 18-party opposition coalition that Milosevic's cronies manipulated election results by using a sophisticated software program. Opposition leaders said they had obtained a copy of the program and would use it to illustrate how the vote was rigged to favor Milosevic's candidacy. But the court is full of Milosevic loyalists and has rendered a number of controversial verdicts. Information Minister Goran Matic claimed the opposition ``committed electoral fraud'' and was now trying to provoke violence by ``discrediting and denying the validity of the result.''

With dozens of road blocks in place for the third day as part of the opposition's campaign of anti-Milosevic civil disobedience, police attempted to clear roads in some areas but refrained from using force, Beta reported. But near Pozarevac, Milosevic's home town, about 30 miles southeast of Belgrade, tensions grew after police arrested several truckers whose vehicles were blocking a road. Dozens of people subsequently sat down on the pavement, strengthening the blockade. The opposition planned a rally in Belgrade for Thursday billed as a final push to drive Milosevic from power. There were signs that Milosevic's control over the media, until now the principal propaganda pillar of his regime, was fraying. The main state-run daily in the northern province of Vojvodina declared Wednesday that its editorial policy would switch from following the government line to objectively reporting on events. Its Wednesday edition carried numerous reports on opposition activities. Previously, it had reported on the opposition only to criticize them as lackeys of the West. In Belgrade, where the civil disobedience campaign has been less noticeable than in other cities, more people appeared to be joining the opposition protests. Hundreds of stores were closed and city bus drivers and garbage collectors stayed off the job, leaving overflowing trash containers scattered in the streets. The postal service announced a warning strike for later in the day, and by noon, the city core was effectively put off limits to cars and other vehicles by thousands of pedestrians roaming the streets and blocking traffic. On Tuesday, Belgrade's prosecutor issued arrest orders for 13 opposition leaders involved in organizing a walkout at the Kolubara coal mine. In an interview published in Moscow's Komersant daily, Kostunica said he believed Milosevic was preparing to resort to force. ``He experiences no moral dilemma or torments of the soul about that,'' Kostunica said in comments published Wednesday. ``However ... it is clear that he does not have enough force at present.'' Milosevic acknowledges Kostunica won more votes in the five-candidate contest but insists he fell short of the required majority and has called a run-off for Sunday. The opposition claim Kostunica won the election outright and refuse to participate in the run-off, claiming the Yugoslav president would only cheat again.

Slobodan Milosevic's police entered a major coal mine Wednesday to break up the largest of the nationwide strikes aimed at ousting the Yugoslav president, an independent news agency said. Truckloads of police and soldiers went into the Kolubara mine complex south of Belgrade after the government said the five-day strike threatened electricity supplies, the independent Beta news agency said. A striker who answered the telephone at the facility, which employs 7,000 workers, said miners were refusing to leave the compound and so far there had been no clashes or arrests.

Taiwan's new premier was greeted on Wednesday with a stock market dip, careful words from the opposition and caution from business leaders. One of Chang Chun-hsiung's most pressing tasks as the government's third most powerful leader is to restore investors' confidence in the administration, which took office in May. Taiwan's stock market has been on a steady slide since May, losing about 40 percent of its value. Many investors worry that President Chen Shui-bian's government lacks a clear economic policy and favors social issues over business. Former Premier Tang Fei, who resigned Tuesday citing declining health, struggled to halt the market decline. Chang's appointment failed to comfort investors immediately. Blue chips closed down 2.36 percent Wednesday, and trading volume was at its lowest since Sept. 27, 1999, when the island was recovering from a devastating earthquake. Chang, 62, is a former lawmaker with a reputation for being an adept negotiator who can unite people across party lines. His mediating skills are desperately needed in Taiwan's fiercely partisan legislature, where the president's Democratic Progressive Party has a minority. But he has no background in economics. Chang immediately sought to calm investors Wednesday and to win over opposition lawmakers, pledging to work hard to restore political stability. ``We will use our greatest efforts and most sincere, modest attitude to listen to the public and the opposition parties,'' Chang said. Chang also announced that the Cabinet would be reshuffled. The first victim was Finance Minister Shea Jia-dong, the target of some blame for the stock market's volatility. The new Cabinet was expected to be introduced Thursday. Several business leaders said they preferred to wait for the appointment of the new Cabinet before making any comments. Wang Yung-ching, chairman of Formosa Plastics Corp., Taiwan's largest conglomerate, had little to say about the new premier but indicated that he would be sorry if Economic Minister Lin Hsin-yi were replaced. Opposition parties generally refrained from criticizing Chang and expressed regret about Tang's departure. The president had picked Tang, a member of the former ruling Nationalist Party, because he wanted to build a ``people's government'' that could rise above partisan politics. Lien Chan, chairman of the Nationalist Party, said Chen's administration never worked as a ``people's government'' and did not respect Tang's powers. Lien also warned that Tang's resignation could stall the approval of the government budget. Legislators from the president's party, the DPP, applauded the choice of Chang, saying the new premier would help speed up decision-making and devise consistent policies. DPP lawmaker Lee Wen-chung said Tang's resignation had been expected and that ``sharper confrontation'' with Nationalist lawmakers was likely.

For the past week and a half, Yugoslavs have confronted their government with street demonstrations, strikes and boycotts. The protesters claim that opposition presidential candidate Vojislav Kostunica won last month's election and that the incumbent Slobodan Milosevic should relinquish power. Milosevic insists that his opponent failed to win at least 50 percent of the vote and that a run off election will be held Sunday. Neither side is giving an inch and today the action is centered to the Kolubara coal mining complex. The World's Nenad Chebeck is in the Serbian capital of Belgrade. Nenad, how did things unfold today in Kolubara? Well, it was pretty dramatic. For a while it appeared as if the police is going to move in. There are about 7000 miners on strike in the Kolubara coal mine. It's Serbia's most important coal mine. It's about 35 miles outside the Serbian capital Belgrade. Crack police troops sort of put a cordon around the striking miners. One unit sort of went in and took over the administrative buildings. That was when the miners appealed to the rest of the population to come and help them and sort of literally, within a couple of hours, thousands and thousands of people started streaming towards the mine. Some came from the neighboring villages on foot, others set out from Belgrade in cars, buses, lorries. And within hours actually thousands and thousands of people assembled outside the coal mine. There was a police line there blocking their route and then apparently one man came across with a caterpillar and threatened to sort of to push the police buses and vehicles aside with the caterpillar. The police then moved him and then thousands of people streamed into the coal mine, sort of, and there were scenes of great joy as the people from the neighboring villages, towns, and Belgrade indeed itself joined the striking miners. A little bit later on the leader of the Opposition, Vojislov Kostunica, the man who claims that he is now the President of Yugoslavia, came and addressed the miners saying that they have to persevere and they have to do it peacefully and accused President Milosevic of creating chaos and wanting to create civil war in the country. On a practical level then Nenad, how effective is that strike at Kolubara? Is it having much impact? I think this is a very, very important element. I mean I'm sort of being cautious about calling it crucial or a key element. But I think this is very important that police troops which came to Kolubara were crack police units. They had orders, it would appear, to break the miner's strike and possibly bring in other people who were willing to sort of work in the coal mine, very important coal mine. The whole idea of the miners joining the anti-Milosevic demonstration is very important because throughout the last eleven years of anti-Milosevic demonstrations, this is the first time that the workers have joined in the protest. So far, we have had the intelligentia, we've had students, we've had the middle class demonstrate against Milosevic. That's why this particular protest is very, very important. So what is happening at the same time where you are in Belgrade? In Belgrade we've seen protests going on throughout the whole day. There were protests in various banks, there were protests in shops, almost every office was at some point sort of blocked and stopped working for a few hours. When I tried to have my photograph taken for the accreditation with the Minister of Information here, I couldn't do it because all the photo shops were on strike today. We are also hearing sort of something which is certainly very disturbing news for President Milosevic. Today a journalist from Politica, which is the most important government-controlled daily and from Radio Belgrade, which again is the most important electronic media in the country, one of the pillars of President Milosevic's power. Today journalists, about 8 of them from Politica and about 40 from Radio Belgrade, had a meeting and demanded that these two sort of really important medias in Belgrade change their editorial policy and start telling the people the truth. Now that is a very, very significant development. We'll see whether these demands are going to spread or whether more people will join them. But with the miners striking in Kolubara and with the media sort of shaking here, I would say sort of that Milosevic is in a very, very delicate position at the moment. Against this backdrop Nenad, the Opposition has now given Milosevic a deadline of tomorrow afternoon to admit defeat and ultimately step down. Isn't the deadline backing the Opposition into a corner at best and dangerous at worst? Well, they are in a corner anyway. Once they have rejected the second round of voting, they did paint themselves into a corner and they have got no option now but to sort of continue with strikes, civil disobedience, trying to drive the country down to a halt and in that way sort of push President Milosevic out of power. They have got no other option. For tomorrow, they have organized a demonstration, which they say will be the biggest one so far. They have invited the people from the rest of Serbia to come to Belgrade, to come to the Serbian capital and to show Milosevic that they don't want him as their President anymore. The World's Nenad Chebeck speaking to us from Belgrade. Thank you for the update Nenad. You are welcome.

The Constitutional Court in Yugoslavia has reportedly annulled part of last month's controversial presidential election. Opposition leaders say the ruling means the vote is now null and void but they say they will continue their protest to force President Slobadon Milosevic from power. Paul Wood reports. The man the Opposition say is the true winner of the election, Vojislov Coustunitza, says he believes this decision by the Constitutional Court is a trick designed to divide the Opposition and take the momentum out of their protest, which is daily gathering force. The Opposition campaign manager, Zoran Djindjic says the ruling amounts to a cancellation of the whole election, with no date set for a re-run. If so, these appear to be classic delaying tactics by Mr. Milosevic, who has in the past proved himself a master tactician and who may this time be trying to set a trap for the Opposition.

A Boston paper carried an appropriate headline to describe last night's dual of the candidates - World War I. In the first of 3 debates Vice President Al Gore and Texas Governor George W. Bush argued about taxes, social security, medicare, prescription drug benefits and abortion. But if you are hoping for either man to articulate a vision of America's place in the world, you probably came away disappointed. The World's Jeb Sharp reports. The debate only touched lightly on foreign policy reflecting a trend that has been developing since the end of the cold war. According to Allan Schroeder, author of the new book Presidential Debates - 40 years of high risk TV. If you go back to 1960, Kennedy and Nixon spent a lot of those four debates they had that year talking specifically about the cold war issues and in 76 and in 80 more, you know, toward the end of cold war there was still quite an emphasis on foreign policy and the tradition was that you would do at least one debate devoted to foreign policy. In more recent years, the candidates have backed away from that. Still, the candidates did have to face a couple of direct foreign policy questions from moderator Jim Lara. Vice President Gore, President Milosevic of Yugoslavia refuses to accept the election results and leave office. What action, if any, should the United States take to get him out of there? Gore's answer and Bush's rebuttal were similar in same ways. Both praised the results of the Serbian elections, said it was time for Milosevic to go and recommended diplomatic pressure to help him on his way. Neither advocated military action. Bush went a step further by recommending Russia take a lead role in urging Milosevic to step aside. Gore disagreed saying the United States might not like the outcome if it where to invite the Russians in. Jim Lara followed up with another foreign policy question for Governor Bush and a slip of the tongue. How would you go about as President deciding when it was in the national interest to use US force, General? Governor, not General Bush, said vital national interest must be at stake in order to justify military intervention. I would take the use of force very seriously. I would be guarded in my approach. I don't think we can be all things to all people in the world. I think we got to be very careful when we commit our troops. The Vice President and I have big disagreement about the use of troops. He believes in nation building. I would be very careful about using our troops as nation builders. I believe the role of the military is to fight and win war and therefore prevent war from happening in the first place. Gore responded with a somewhat different emphasis. I think we should be reluctant to get involved in some place in a foreign country. But if our national security is at stake, if we have allies, if we have tried every other course, if we are sure military action will succeed and if the costs are proportionate to the benefits, we should get involved. Now just because we don't want to get involved everywhere it does not mean we should back off anywhere it comes up. Many of last night's exchanges seemed designed to score political points but this one simply demonstrated a subtle but significant foreign policy difference between the two candidates. While both men appeared reluctant to get involved in peace keeping operations, Vice President Al Gore seemed less likely to rule the option out. For The World, I am Jeb Sharp.

In a decision that seems designed to buy time for President Slobodan Milosevic, Yugoslavia's highest court Wednesday night annulled parts of the Sept. 24 presidential elections, according to the official news agency, Tanjug. The decision, which was described only briefly on Wednesday night and will be released on Thursday, is likely to require a repeat of the first round with the same five candidates. It means that there will be no second-round runoff on Sunday between Milosevic and his main challenger, Vojislav Kostunica, and that the current tussle between Serbia's ruler and his opposition could drag on. Kostunica immediately called the decision ``a trap'' and said it showed that Milosevic `'is weaker than ever.'' But Kostunica, a constitutional lawyer, said he wanted to see the entire decision before commenting further. Goran Svilanovic, a party leader in Kostunica's coalition, said a repeat of the first round is unacceptable to him, but the decision would have to be Kostunica's to make. ``Milosevic is offering us everything to get us off the street,'' Svilanovic said. ``He wants to buy time and stay president until July,'' when his current term was originally supposed to expire. Kostunica and his 18-party coalition say that he won the first round outright, with 51.4 percent of the vote, and that Milosevic and his Federal Election Commission stole and manipulated votes to bring Kostunica under 50 percent and require a runoff, which had been scheduled for Sunday. Kostunica has vowed that he would defend his victory without a runoff, and to that end, the opposition has called a massive rally for Thursday in Belgrade, the climax to a rolling general strike, intended to push Milosevic out of power. In an open letter to Milosevic on Wednesday, Kostunica said ``it will be better for you to recognize'' defeat or risk ``the danger of open clashes'' throughout Serbia. The court will present the opposition yet another set of choices: to accept a new first round under the same unfair conditions and with the same potential for vote fraud; to reject the court order and try to overthrow Milosevic through street pressure; or to continue to try to get international mediators to ensure a fair recount of the first round. But the debate over whether to participate in Sunday's second round has suddenly become moot. On Wednesday, much of Belgrade came to a halt when thousands of students marched in protest, blocking traffic. The state communications agency, the PTT, went on strike. Many stores were shut and garbage went uncollected. Elsewhere in the country, major roads and railways were blocked and opposition-run cities were at a near standstill. Kostunica and the coalition brought the case to the constitutional court to prove fraud in the counting of the votes by the Federal Electoral Commission and to get a recount. They did not challenge the voting process itself. But the court, according to the official Tanjug news agency, also invalidated the voting, which would seem to mean a first-round repeat. It is not clear if Kostunica would accept a repeat, or when it would be. Some experts said that Milosevic may want first to swear in the newly elected federal parliament _ which he and his allies control _ and have it set a new date, enabling him to remain president until the summer; others said the court decision is likely to specify a new date. In his 13 years of ruling Serbia, Milosevic has proven a master at using legal wrangles to maneuver himself out of difficulties, to buy time and to exhaust his opponents. The key sentence in the Tanjug report said only: ``The Federal Constitutional Court has unanimously decided to annul the part of the electoral process for the president of Yugoslavia relating to voting, determining and announcing the results of the vote.'' State television said on Wednesday night that the court was writing the decision and that the public would be informed about the details of the decision on Thursday. Kostunica's representative on the Federal Electoral Commission, Nebojsa Bakarec, said on Wednesday night: ``Until I get the decision it's hard to comment. But it seems they have annulled everything that happened on the 24th. This is something we didn't ask for. We just asked the court to annul the decision about the final results.'' Zoran Djindjic, who has led the opposition campaign, called the court decision ``the height of cynicism and yet another fraud,'' and said that Milosevic, frustrated by earlier attempts to overturn the vote, finally ``annulled the elections through the Constitutional Court.'' The court did not annul the elections _ also held on Sept. 24 _ for federal parliament, which Milosevic and his allies won, or the local elections, which strengthened opposition control of many key Serbian cities and towns.

Police battled demonstrators Thursday and black smoke billowed from parliament after security forces drove off mobs trying to storm the building to demand Slobodan Milosevic accept electoral defeat. Clashes spread through the streets of the capital, which echoed with the sound of stun grenades and tear gas fired to break up the crowds. Dozens of people were injured, according to witnesses. The melee erupted at the start of a huge rally the opposition called to force Milosevic to accept electoral defeat by Vojislav Kostunica in the Sept. 24 election. In what was apparently the largest anti-Milosevic protest since his 13-year rule began, hundreds of thousands of people had assembled less than an hour before the rally was to begin, and tens of thousands more were seen streaming into the city. Opposition leaders attempted to rally the crowd, blasting rock music through the capital and calling for nonviolence. An opposition leader told the crowd that Kostunica would address the rally ``from inside'' parliament. The melee began when angry protesters charged the parliament building, pelting the doors with stones. Riot police responded with tear gas as the protesters broke through a police cordon and reached the parliament doors. Police had already fired tear gas at a group of protesters who tried to push their way into the domed building earlier in the afternoon. ``At this moment, terror rules in Belgrade,'' the pro-Milosevic government television said in a commentary. ``They are attacking everyone they see on the streets and there is chaos.'' A reporter at the scene saw at least five injured protesters lying on the steps of parliament. One policeman caught by the crowd was beaten. Several policemen deserted their cordon and joined the protesters, reporters at the scene said. Five police cars were set afire in the front of the parliament.. Tensions were rising after the Yugoslav Constitutional Court issued a ruling that one justice reportedly said nullified the recent election. The opposition claimed the decision by the pro-Milosevic court was aimed at prolonging his stay in power. By early afternoon, downtown Belgrade was a mass of people, many streaming toward the parliament building and blocking traffic as they did so. People in the crowd waved flags, shouted and jostled each other in the streets. Many wore paper caps with the slogan, ``We'll Endure.'' They moved past shops, some shut down with signs stating, ``Closed because of Robbery'' _ an allusion to opposition claims that Milosevic stole the elections. Thousands more people joined smaller rallies in towns throughout the country. In the third largest city, Nis, about 10,000 people tried to push their way into the local office of Milosevic's party but were persuaded by opposition leaders not to give police a reason to attack them. The government acknowledged that Kostunica outpolled Milosevic but says he fell short of a majority in the five-candidate race. A run-off had been set for Sunday. Late Wednesday, the constitutional court, in a brief dispatch by the state-run Tanjug news agency, said ``part'' of the Sept. 24 election had been annulled. There was no comprehensive statement from the court. But one justice, Milutin Srdic, told Radio Free Europe that the entire election result had been thrown out and a new vote would be required. In the meantime, Srdic said Milosevic could remain in office through his term, which expires in July. The opposition said it had not been officially notified of the ruling. However, opposition legal expert Nebojsa Bakarec dismissed the decision as the latest ``in a series of unconstitutional moves'' by Milosevic ``to manipulate the electoral will of the people.'' The United States, Britain and other Western governments condemned the apparent move to extend Milosevic's tenure. ``The people of Yugoslavia have made their will known: Milosevic should not thwart them,'' Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said in Egypt. In what the opposition hoped was a further sign the regime was crumbling, more than 160 employees of Serbian state television _ a major pillar of Milosevic's power _ were fired Thursday after going on strike. Most were technicians and staff of nonpolitical programs. Most Milosevic loyalists remained, and kept the network on the air. Police had set up roadblocks outside Belgrade, but the convoys of protesters were so large that most of them were allowed to pass. A convoy of about 2,000 people was briefly blocked near the town of Smederevska Palanka, about 30 miles south of Belgrade, but it eventually pushed its way through barricades. Protesters used a front-end loader to shove aside two sand trucks used by authorities to try to block a 12-mile line of cars and buses with about 15,000 people traveling from the opposition stronghold of Cacak. Riot police stood by without intervening. At another roadblock, trucks were pushed away and demonstrators negotiated with a police commander to be allowed through. At yet another blockade, angry protesters overturned a police car and dumped it into a ditch. The mass march on Belgrade followed a day of dramatic developments at the strikebound Kolubara coal mine. Police there were forced to abandon plans to take over the compound after confronting fearless anti-Milosevic crowds. Such defiance in the face of police was unprecedented in Yugoslavia's 55-year communist history.

Black smoke billowed from a burning parliament Thursday and police fought demonstrators after mobs tried to storm the building to demand that Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic accept electoral defeat. Some demonstrators broke through a police cordon and managed to get inside the parliament building, and more than an hour after smoke was first sighted coming from parliament, small fires continued to burn within. Clashes spread through the streets of the capital, which echoed with the sound of stun grenades and tear gas fired to break up the crowds. Dozens of people were injured, according to witnesses.

obviously, all of this was very welcome news in washington, where the clinton administration has spent a great deal of time and military effort trying to get rid of the man they consider to be the butcher of the balkans. nbc's andrea mitchell tonight on where we go from here. what washington has been waiting for -- a popular uprising against milosevic. u.s. officials say he can still cause trouble with armed thugs. but, they say, if he survives this time, it will be a miracle. the people are trying to get their country back. and we support democracy and the will of the serbian people. european leaders also press milosevic to step down peacefully. the message for milosevic is clear. "go, go now, go before any more lives are lost." in fact, u.s. intelligence believes reports that milosevic tries to declare martial law in recent days, and the army ignores him, his control vanishing. even his cronies abandoning him. i think he's lost most of the instruments of power. he's pulling the levers, and there's nothing at the other end of the lever. today a change in emphasis. u.s. officials not pressing their demand that milosevic be tried immediately for war crimes. the first priority -- get him out of power. for now, the issue is his removal from power. the issue is not for him to stand trial. where could he go? u.s. officials say possibly russia, although that country has said he's not welcome. or, they say, he could get "lost in china," even iraq. if milosevic does give up, what about the new leader, kostunica? u.s. officials say they can do business with him. he is a strong nationalist, but is also anti-communist, a democrat, a trial lawyer who opposed the u.s. over kosovo, but has advisers who are not anti-american. tonight, president clinton is calling upon russia to drop milosevic and endorse the opposition and promises the u.s. will lift sanctions against yugoslavia as soon as a democratic regime takes over. andrea mitchell, nbc news, at the state department.

From BBC News in London, I am James Cawling for The World. The whole of Serbia has risen up against Slobodan Milosevic. Those were the words of opposition leader Vojislav Kostunica to crowds in Belgrade. In a television interview, Kostunica declared he had replaced Milosevic as President. Earlier hundreds of thousands of people filled the city center demanding Milosevic step down. Protestors braved clouds of tear gas to take control of the Federal Parliament building, which was set on fire and several television stations. An announcer appeared on the main channel to announce the arrival of free broadcasting. Journalist Misha Glenny was on the streets. The Federal Parliament here is on fire. Demonstrators have moved into it. Police are using tear gas all over the place, dispersing many of the demonstrators, but frankly all hell has broken lose here. The whereabouts of Slobodan Milosevic remain unclear at this hour, but opposition leader Alexander Popovic says it's now clear his time and power is over. I think that the majority of the people who are betting that this is the day, this is the end, that today is the end or maybe tomorrow, but that it's over, that you are going to be free.

In Washington, President Clinton says he will lift sanctions once democratic forces are in control. He says America stands alongside the people of Yugoslavia.

With televisions in the White House tuned to the images of protesters seizing the Parliament in Belgrade, Yugoslavia, President Clinton stepped into the Rose Garden on Thursday to encourage them on, at once offering American support while making it clear that the considerable American military presence in the region would not intervene. ``I think the people are trying to get their country back,'' Clinton said, just as it was becoming clear that the security forces would stand back as protesters took over government buildings and the central television broadcast center. ``The people of Serbia have made their opinion clear,'' Clinton said. ``They did it when they voted peacefully and quietly, and now they're doing it in the streets.'' The consensus among U.S. intelligence officials, senior military officers and diplomats interviewed on Thursday is that the era of Slobodan Milosevic was coming to an end. But they also said they were awaiting formal announcements from the security forces _ in particular the Yugoslav army and the Interior Ministry's special police _ that they supported Vojislav Kostunica as the winner of the presidential election last month. That, the officials said, would be definitive. Sandy Berger, the president's national security adviser, warned that the biggest risk was that Milosevic would marshall some part of the military in a violent attempt toward rolling back the protests. ``This was a dramatic day, and it is difficult for me to imagine how Milosovic might reconstitute his power,'' Berger said in a telephone interview. ``But we have to speak with a note of caution because he is capable of making a last stand. I don't think this is over yet. But it will be awfully hard for him to put it back in the bottle.'' U.S. officials said that Milosevic is probably still in Serbia, seeking refuge, temporarily at least, in one of the Camp David-style retreats or command bunkers built outside of Belgrade. These officials said they do not believe Milosevic had fled on Thursday for Belarus or any other country that might offer him a safe haven from arrest on charges for war crimes issued by the tribunal at The Hague, Netherlands. ``We don't know where he is, but it's over, he's done,'' said one four-star military officer who was apprised during the day about developments in Yugoslavia. The overwhelming emotion in the White House was one of joy. Milosevic's violent efforts at maintaining a Serb-dominated Yugoslavia had predated Clinton's arrival in the White House but now he was on the verge of being forced out on the last days of Clinton's watch. ``If you can't get Middle East peace,'' one senior official said, ``this may be the next best thing.'' Several senior administration officials said that their first priority was assuring that Milosevic leaves the country _ even if his destination put him out of reach of international law. ``Ultimately there should be some accountability,'' said one official who had participated in the decisions to intervene in Bosnia and then Kosovo. ``But you also have to be practical and clear about the sequence here, and first things are first. The first thing is for him to step down, and for the transition to take place peacefully, and for him to get out of the country. And we are not about to get in the way of that.'' Clinton's comments on Thursday _ first at the White House, then in asides during a speech at Princeton University _ were directed at encouraging the popular uprising while making it clear that the United States was keeping its distance. Clinton explicitly ruled out using the approximately 11,000 American troops in neighboring Bosnia and Kosovo, or the naval and marine forces that have been conducting exercises nearby in the Adriatic Sea. ``I don't believe it's an appropriate case for military intervention,'' Clinton said, ``and I don't believe that the United States should say or do anything which would only strengthen Milosevic's hand.'' But Washington has hardly been shy about offering incentives to the people of Serbia to take the kind of action that unfolded on Thursday. The administration has funneled money to voter education groups and the independent media in Serbia. Clinton has often said that he is willing to lift economic sanctions against the country as soon as Milosovic is gone. ``The people of Serbia have spoken with their ballot, they have spoken on the streets,'' Clinton said at Princeton on Thursday afternoon. ``I hope the hour is near when their voices will be heard and we can welcome them to democracy, to Europe, to the world's community. And when they do, we will move as quickly as possible to lift the sanctions and build the kind of responsible partnership that the people there deserve.'' That would allow American and other international aid money to pour in, and permit investors to rebuild the shattered country. While the process could take years, officials on Thursday were pointing to the speed with which Eastern European countries turned from dumping dictators to opening factories. But they made no mention of the latest parallel, the popular ousting of President Suharto of Indonesia in 1998. While celebrated at the time, it led to two years of ever-worsening economic and political chaos. Still, the uprising in Belgrade was celebrated from the White House to Secretary of State Madeleine Albright's plane. Flying back from Mideast peace talks in Egypt on Thursday, she said, ``The important point now is for Kostunica to be recognized as president.'' And she promised that, with European foreign ministers, she would work ``to make sure this proceeds in a way with a minimum of violence and that the people be heard without violence.'' On the presidential campaign trail, both major party candidates expressed support for Milosevic's opponents in Yugoslavia. Gov. George W. Bush, the Republican nominee, said, ``Our country must work closely with our allies in Europe and the international community including Russia to pressure Mr. Milosevic to go.'' Vice President Al Gore, the Democratic nominee, said: ``We call upon Milosevic to get out of power. It will be taken from him if he does not, because the people of Serbia have spoken and now they are rising up.''

The dramatic events in Yugoslavia filled cable television networks with pictures of chaotic Belgrade streets, demonstrators throwing things at retreating police and blazes at Parliament. One of the busiest television correspondents reporting on Thursday's unrest never thought the pictures would make it out. ``I was surprised to see how little the police were intervening and surprised to see that we were still on the air,'' said CNN's Belgrade bureau chief, Alessio Vinci. CNN, followed by Fox News Channel and MSNBC, repeatedly aired pictures of the milling crowds from Belgrade on Thursday. The cable network BBC America pre-empted its afternoon programming to air continuous BBC News coverage of the uprising. CNN depends on state-run Yugoslavian television for transmission of reports and has been cut off by angry authorities in the past, Vinci said. He believed embattled leader Slobodan Milosevic and his cronies ``must feel either really scared or really confident, one of the two,'' he said. Fox News Channel and MSNBC were relying on pictures from news agencies like Reuters and Associated Press Television News and those beamed on Serbian TV, spokesmen for those networks said. NBC reporter Jim Maceda was on the scene, but without the technology to deliver live reports, and Fox News was trying to get a reporter in. Vinci said he sensed early that something would happen on Thursday because police who would normally aggressively turn back demonstrators were instead giving in. Even though demonstrators threw things at police, and they responded by lobbing tear gas canisters into the crowd, Vini said he was surprised at the lack of anger toward police. ``This was not a confrontation between the people and the police,'' he said. ``This was a confrontation between the people and the symbols of power.''

The Serbian nationalist hysteria that swept Slobodan Milosevic to power in the late 1980s evaporated long ago, leaving him an isolated figure ruling over a shrinking land. But with resilience, ruse and ruthlessness, he outmaneuvered his enemies, until at last the enemy became his own people. Always, Milosevic believed he could outlast his foes. But the hundreds of thousands of Serbs in Belgrade who on Thursday stormed the parliament and seized the television network that has long sustained him with its propaganda, made clear that the tide of history had escaped him. Of the Kosovo Albanians, his first enemies, Milosevic could say that they were intent on a ``demographic genocide'' against the Serbs _ a reference to their high birth rate; of the Croats, that they were reincarnated fascists _ a reference to their World War II past as a Nazi puppet state; of the Bosnian Muslims, that they were the Ottoman Turks of old bent on destroying the Serbs. And of NATO, he could say that it represented evil American imperialism. But of his own people, seemingly undivided at last, intent on ending their European isolation, enraged by one maneuver too many that seemed to rob them of their vote in the recent presidential election, Milosevic could find nothing to say on Thursday. He could summon no specter or myth that might divert or divide or cow. The possibility that even so cunning a man might recover authority seemed remote. From western capitals _ Washington, London, Berlin _ the calls to Milosevic were unambiguous, reflecting a conviction that the man who stirred and sustained Yugoslavia's long unraveling had at last run out of options: Accept your people's verdict and go before more damage is done or blood is spilled. On the evidence, Milosevic's time should have been up long ago: his years of rule have seen a succession of lost wars, hundreds of thousands of Serbs uprooted, an economy ruined, wages slashed and an area that was among the most prosperous in the communist bloc turned into a conspicuous center of poverty. But it was always easy to underestimate him. Indeed, it was not until the Kosovo war last year that western governments, including the United States, turned against Milosevic. At the Dayton conference in 1995 that ended the war in Bosnia, he was still central to American diplomatic efforts, winning friends with his focus on the big picture and his evocative language: details, to Milosevic, were mere ``technology.'' In diplomacy, as at home, the Serbian strongman long succeeded in convincing others that he could not be circumvented. His methods for conveying and retaining this authority were multiple. In the late 1980s, he saw the power of crude nationalism in a Serbian society whose binding ideology _ communism _ was disintegrating. The motto of his Communist-turned-socialist party was straightforward: ``Serbia does not kneel.'' Such slogans initially earned him a mob appeal. His posters were everywhere in the early 1990s as Yugoslavia descended into violence. But kneel Serbia ultimately did in a succession of wars _ in Croatia, then in Bosnia. Milosevic always portrayed these conflicts as defensive attempts to allow Serbs to ``remain in Yugoslavia'' even as he did more than anyone else to precipitate the conflicts through his hate-filled propaganda against all his neighbors. Most Serbs believed him. The deaths of thousands of Muslims in the Serbian concentration camps in Bosnia in 1992 and at Srebrenica in 1995 were often dismissed in Belgrade as ``Muslim propaganda.'' In fact, they were a clear demonstration of the Milosevic's readiness to resort to force _ against the Albanians of Kosovo in the 1980s as he suppressed their autonomy, against demonstrators on the streets of Belgrade in 1991, against the Muslims of Bosnia in the violent rampage of 1992, and the Albanians again in the late 1990s. No Stalin, no Hitler, Milosevic, 59, nonetheless proved himself over the past 13 years to be the most violent ruler Europe has seen in many years. Over 200,000 people have died in the wars of Yugoslavia's destruction. His inability to use force in the current crisis made clear how his strength has evaporated. His instinct for survival had long proved remarkable. As the wars turned in 1995 and the vision of ``Greater Serbia'' receded, to be replaced by a vision of ``Greater Slobo,'' many observers expected Milosevic to fall. The streets of Belgrade were filled with demonstrators for three months as 1996 turned to 1997. But he deployed a succession of other tactics to replace the galvanizing frenzy of military conflict. One constant ploy was ``divide and rule'' _ a highly effective tactic in a society disoriented by the propaganda of Serbian television and subjugation. One old Serbian joke had a farmer saying that he would ``vote for the opposition when it is in power.'' But it was no joke that many people long thought that way. Even as Serbia's resources dwindled, Milosevic used what money there was to buy loyalty from the secret police he armed and from a coterie of business and political associates who dominated the trafficking in the country's increasingly closed and corrupt economy. Behind this loyal entourage, he hid himself. The reality of Serbia was increasingly grim, a country poor and isolated, a far cry from the exalted vision that Milosevic started by offering the Serbs, most memorably, at Kosovo Field in 1989, on the 600th anniversary of the Serbs' losing battle to the Ottoman Turks. Then he declared that the Serbs ``never conquered or exploited others'' and were imbued with a ``historical being that throughout history was a liberating one.'' But a ``vassal mentality'' among Serbian politicians had too long allowed ``the humiliation of Serbia.'' He concluded: ``Here we are today on the field of Kosovo to say that it is not so any longer.'' For much of his rule, Milosevic succeeded in sustaining his rule through such myths: that a Balkan enemy, or the outside world, or NATO, was intent on humiliating Serbia and the only way to resist was to stick together. But the purpose of doing so seemed increasingly elusive. Survival seemed to become Milosevic's only political intent. As the Serbs of Croatia lost their homes in 1995, and large chunks of Bosnia slipped from grasp, and finally Kosovo too was lost in an avoidable war with NATO in 1999, he persisted. The son of parents who both committed suicide, Milosevic seemed intent on dragging his people toward the sort of collective death that Serbian myth tends to portray as a form of redemption. Even Serbian myths exhaust themselves, however. Last year, Milosevic was indicted by the war crimes tribunal in The Hague, Netherlands. As the country suffered, and Serbs saw no prospect of recovery, the police and army became estranged. Vojislav Kostunica, the man who appears on the verge of taking power, faces overwhelming problems, not least the fact that the disintegration of Yugoslavia may not be over. Both Montenegro and Kosovo seek independence that he, like Milosevic, opposes. But Kostunica understands his most effective weapons. He talks unceasingly about the lifting of economic sanctions, the need for dialogue and his desire to turn Serbia once more into a ``normal'' country.

President Hosni Mubarak, visibly angered by what he described as the excessive use of force by Israel in clashes with Palestinians, berated Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak on Friday for not showing up for a meeting he hosted in Egypt. The Egyptian leader, speaking on state television, also said that an emergency Arab summit he called to review the Middle East peace process and the situation in Palestinians areas will be held on October 21 or 22, most probably in Cairo. Mubarak criticized Barak for not accepting demands by Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat that an international committee should investigate the causes of the violence that has engulfed Palestinian territories and Israel since September 28. Scores have been killed and nearly 1,900 wounded _ the vast majority Palestinian _ in the clashes. His criticism of Barak and his animated account of how he felt when he watched television images of young Palestinians shot by Israel's security forces appear to signal a crisis in Egypt's relations with Israel. Mubarak met with Arafat and U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright on Thursday in the Egyptian Red Sea resort of Sharm El-Sheik. Barak initially agreed to attend but later decided not to after talks in Paris with Arafat and Albright on Wednesday. ``I don't know what he could have possibly gained from this (not going to Sharm El-Sheik). ... With this attitude, it is not possible for the peace process to go forward,'' said Mubarak, whose country in 1979 became the first Arab state to sign a peace treaty with Israel. ``I was surprised to find in the morning (of Thursday) that Barak won't come, so I said `he's free.' I am not going to force anyone to come. He who does not want peace, won't come.'' Turning to Arafat's demand for an international committee, he said he could not understand why Barak was instead insisting on a Palestinian-Israeli investigation. ``I want to say that this way the peace process will not be moving. ... When things like these come up, are they meant to delay the peace process or what? Mubarak said he was enraged when he saw television images of 12-year-old Palestinian Mohammed Jamal Aldura being fatally shot by Israeli troops in Gaza as he and his father, who was seriously wounded, tried to shelter behind a barrel when caught in cross fire. Israel acknowledged that its troops had shot the two. ``A child who died in the lap of his father, this really makes one loses his senses,'' Mubarak said. ``This makes rocks have feelings.'' ``Excessive use of weapons against protests and marches and things like that will not lead to solutions. Not giving every country its right in its land won't lead to a solution,'' he said. ``That is why I caution, and I have done that many times, against the continuous use of excessive weapons will not lead to peace, and the people will continue to hate each other.''

thanks for joining us. here's our story this half hour -- there's dancing in the streets of belgrade as angry demonstrations have turned into celebrations. tens of thousands of people crowded the streets of the yugoslavian capital today after the apparent overthrow of president slobodan milosevic. yesterday, protesters stormed key government buildings and seized serb state television in belgrade. russia has joined the west in its support of opposition leader vojislav kostunica. russian foreign minister igor ivanov congratulated kostunica on his election victory. he also gave him a letter from russian president vladimir putin. putin says he hopes the opposition leader will do "everything possible to overcome the internal political crisis" in yugoslavia. russia was the last european power to withhold support for the opposition. the man who lost power in yugoslavia finally surfaced today. slobodan milosevic met with russian foreign minister igor ivanov. ivanov says milosevic told him he plans to remain in serbia and continue to run its largest political party. indeed milosevic still considers himself to be president, according to his brother borislav. in an interview with cnn, borislav milosevic accused western nations of supporting the demonstrations and said his brother has no plans to leave the city. regardless of how many votes mr. kostunica received, the actions that took place last night are vandalism. it's violence. it shouldn't have happened. that's not democracy. the opposition didn't accept the ruling of the constitutional court and began to storm the parliament, which was not being defended, and inflicted huge material damage. but it also did more damage to our institutions. the next step in the transition to a new government is for the yugoslav parliament to convene. a commission set up to ensure the transfer of power is attempting to call lawmakers to belgrade for a special session. alessio vinci reports that may not happen until tomorrow because some members of parliament will have to travel to belgrade from montenegro. what is going on right now is intense negotiations with all the members of parliament that were elected on september trying to get the majority needed in order to swear in vojislav kostunica as the next president of yugoslavia. with the events of the past week in yugoslavia, the world is getting to know the name of vojislav kostunica. jonathan mann takes a look at the man and his politics. unlike president milosevic, he was not a communist in the long years when party membership was the key to power. he was not among the prominent opposition figures who have struggled against each other almost as hard as the regime. he is an orthodox serb nationalist, but he supports truer democracy for his country and better relations with its neighbors and the west. kostunica is a soft-spoken and uncharismatic figure who spent years building the democratic party of serbia and gathering only modest support. after ten years, people know what are the differences between milosevic's policies and ours. what milosevic was saying and promising and what the opposition parties and i myself was saying in these years and how i was behaving. kostunica is 56, an expert on constitutional law who lives with his wife and pets in a belgrade apartment. he was fired from his job teaching law in 1974 for his opposition to the policies of the tito government. he refused an offer to return in 1989 because of his opposition to the milosevic regime. and he rejects much from the west as well -- the dayton peace accord, western sanctions on yugoslavia, and the war crimes tribunal. in the months before the election, he was careful to distinguish between his support for european aid projects tied to reform and u.s. efforts, which he describes as unhelpful, even to the opposition. i know what the support means when we get from european union, the programs like energy for democracy, school for democracy. those small projects. here we get nothing in advance, just a political support which consists of nothing, and which is mostly used and abused and manipulated by the regime. saying they are just nato parties, as is often said by regime, they are not having their own policy. jonathan mann, cnn. we'll be following the events in yugoslavia all day. to learn more about the situation, just click on our website at headlinenews.com.

This is The World. I am Lisa Mullins. Even Slobodan Milosevic now seems to understand who is the boss in Yugoslavia. Today the man who presided over the disintegration of his country for 13 years met at his villa with Russia's foreign minister and promised not to use force to try to retain power. Milosevic's fate was doomed yesterday when hundreds of thousands of Serbs stormed the parliament and several TV stations. By day's end, it was clear that the Milosevic era had ended and the era of Vojislav Kostunica was about to begin. The World's Nenad Shebek filed this report from the Yugoslav capital, Belgrade. It was a highly intoxicating night as half of Belgrade celebrated in the streets. The morning after, thought of silvering returned to reality. Belgrade woke up to piles of garbage and debris, as well as some broken windows and looted shops. Within hours, basic services resumed and tens of thousands of people started to converge in the city center. In the building where the Belgrade State Council meets, the former opposition leaders were turning to the business of running the country. One of them, Radicor Corech, warns many things can still go wrong. We are working on them, we have a vacuum, system does not exist anymore. The system collapsed. No body is around. We can't find people. Those people we find don't know how to react. This is very dangerous. Right now nobody is policing Belgrade. But others here are less anxious. Every hour means that we are closer to the final victory. Predrag Bulatovic, the deputy leader of Vojislav Kostunica's party says that final victory will be sealed as soon as the Parliament makes it official. Once the parliament is convened in the founding session, it can do the job and Mr. Kostunica who is obsessively devoted to the law and constitution, letter of the constitution, would never accept any other form on the inauguration. Even then Serbia's new leaders will have to make a transition whose difficulty has not always been appreciated elsewhere in Eastern Europe, that from opposing the government to being the government. Vlatislav Sternavich, advisor to the President elect says he is not worried. Democratic opposition of Serbia has already formed a crisis team with all basic fields of government so to say. So these people are now negotiating actually also the formal taking off. And Sternavich says the remaining Milosevic loyalists post no threat. Who are they? I mean they are basically parts of the Milosevic's team that has of course collapsed and with it they have collapsed. In the early evening hours, the head of the Serbian Orthodox Church held an opener at thanksgiving mass. He appealed to Yugoslavia's army not to oppose the will of the people. One of the leaders of the Democratic Alliance, Montelo Beresich, is former Chief of Staff of the Yugoslav army. He has been in touch with the top brass and says there won't be any trouble from the military. General Beresich says that the army belongs to the people and is with the people. According to Beresich, if any general were to try to use the army against the people, his troops would refuse to follow orders. The United States, while enthusiastic about the fall of Milosevic, has been cautious about his successor. During the election campaign, Kostunica criticized Washington for its policies towards the Balkans. He strongly denounced NATO action over Kosovo. The province has been administered by the United Nations for the past year and Milosevic has repeatedly sought to undermine the U.N. mission. But today, Kostunica ally Montono Trichovich, who represents the Kosovo Serbs says the change of power in Belgrade will be good for peace in Kosovo. The main difference between our policy and the policy of Mr. Milosevic is that we want the U.N. mission in Kosovo to succeed while Milosevic wanted it to fail, said Tricovic. But if Milosevic has his way, the United States will not have seen the end of him. Today, he said he wants to stay in politics. Washington immediately rejected that suggestion, insisting that Milosevic stand trial on war crime charges. For The World, this is Nenad Sebek in Belgrade. Actually, Washington has been quite emphatic about what it wants to see in Belgrade. This afternoon, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright made sure there could be no misunderstanding. We have made our position very clear and we believe in the importance of accountability for what Milosevic has done and the important thing, first is to get him out of any position of any kind of power. A very important point is that Kostunica has won, Milosevic has lost. His time is over. He must go. Secretary of State Albright also applauded Russia's new attitude toward Kostunica. In Belgrade today Russian Foreign Minister, Igor Ivanov acknowledged the former opposition leader as Yugoslavia's new President. Ivanov then met with Milosevic at his home in the Yugoslav capital. It was during that meeting, says Susan Woodword of the Center of Defence studies at Kings College, London that the former Serbian strong man showed how out of touch he has been. Milosevic himself has announced to the Russian Foreign Minister Ivanov today that he will come back to normal politics, except to feed electorally and continue to be president of his party, which has a large number, not the majority of the large numbers of seats in the Federal Parliament. I think this is an amazing story, in the sense that it reveals how far away from reality Milosevic has been for quite some years, protected by people who would tell him what they thought he wanted to know, rather than what is real. I don't think he has any options. Why didn't Milosevic fight? Well, I think Milosevic did fight in the ways that he intended to, namely the image we have of Slobodan Milosevic in the United States and in the West is only a partial image of what the man is like. It's much more an image we have created for ourselves. Whereas Milosevic himself would never have held elections if he did not believe in legitimization is through normal processes. What he tried to do was maneuver his election victory. He was willing to steal some vote, but it was still important to him to be elected. So he did choose to fight, but he fought by trying to manipulate the constitutional accord, by trying to manipulate the Federal Election Commission and it failed. We have heard from the White House that the White House feels as though it is unacceptable for Milosevic to hold any kind of position of power at this point. Do we know how Kostunica feels about that? I mean would he include him in the government? Well, I'm glad you've asked the question that way because I think one of the things that is very important is this is something for the Serbs to do and for Kostunica and his cabinet to decide, not for Washington or London or any others to set conditions, which is one of the problems we may encounter over the next several weeks. Kostunica was very clear during the election campaign that he would not send Milosevic to the Hague, that this was a matter for the Serbs themselves to resolve. Because he is a constitutional lawyer, because his main emphasis throughout the campaign and since he won, has been on the rule of law and restoring the rule of law in Serbia, I can predict that he would probably want some kind of judicial hearing. You might even imagine a process like the "Truth and Reconciliation" commission that took place so successfully in South Africa. I think there is a lot to be said for having the Serbs deal with Milosevic themselves through their own legal system. We don't know too much about the man who appears to be if not president now on his way to the presidency, Kostunica, except that he is a Serb nationalist. He has been in the past very critical of NATO's bombing over Kosovo. How much of a friend is he likely to be to the United States? He is a very moderate, modest man who is very direct. There isn't anything hidden, but he does feel very strongly that the Serbs themselves have an important history and culture that has been denied them over the last 30 or 40 years. I don't think he is anymore nationalist than the people that we have been supporting in Sarajevo, in Zagreb and Pristina over the last ten years and indeed it's probably a very good thing that he expresses himself as a Serb who is proud of being a Serb because of the task that the Serbs have to go through now. The hardships that they will have to endure to bring the economy back in order, to recreate a democratic system and the rule of law. What we do know especially is how important democracy as a set of institutions of a constitutional order or the rule of law are to Kostunica. He has being showing that all week and I think that is what we will expect from him in the future. On the road to reconstruction that some of the projects that you are mentioning, will he need Western money, may be specifically American money, to accomplish that? He will need a lot of money. First of all, the financial sanctions are the most difficult aspect of the sanctions to lift because that means rejoining the International Monetary Fund, as all countries find at the end of wars. The first thing they have to do before they can join the IMF and then begin to participate in normal international economic activity, including borrowing money, getting World Bank loans, all of the kind of credits that they will now need for reconstruction, that requires resolving the foreign debt arrears. In addition to that, they will need to do a great deal of modernization, but for that the European Union has already publicly stated that the EU is ready to provide that assistance. Assuming that Kostunica can consolidate power, what does this mean for the United States and NATO missions in Bosnia and Kosovo? Could the families of those servicemen and women who are there expect to see them home any sooner? No. I think that it will make a big difference to the region. It certainly will reduce the military threat that is perceived to be the reason for having American troops in Bosnia and Kosovo, much will be good. But I think that we don't realize how much the difficulties in Kosovo and in Bosnia are very real. They are not only a result of Slobodan Milosevic, the creation of new states out of the former Yugoslavia requires stabilization and it will be a long time before the political status of Kosovo can be decided and the difficulties within Bosnia and Herzegovina can be resolved. We will need NATO troops in the region for sometime. Susan Woodword is a senior research fellow at the Center for Defence Studies at Kings College in London. It's an understatement but to say that it has been a week of momentous change for Yugoslavia. Just Monday, Slobodan Milosevic was on National Television denouncing Vojislav Kostunica and the opposition as "western lackys" who will lead the country into war and poverty. For days the Milosevic regime clung to the notion that the presidential election of September 24th was inconclusive, that Kostunica had not won outright and that there should be a run off election. The opposition would have none of it. They called for a general strike to force Milosevic to back down and accept defeat. The demonstrations earlier this week turned into a popular uprising when the protesters stormed the parliament building in Belgrade yesterday. At the end of a day that saw tumultuous scenes, Vojislav Kostunica told an ecstatic crowd in the capital that a new Serbia had been born. The old Serbia is dead, said Kostunica. This is the beginning of a new life in a democratic Serbia. Kostunica implored the people to destroy nothing in the beautiful city of Belgrade and not to seek revenge either. So Serbia can finally become a normal state. And as we have heard from Belgrade today the man now recognized as Yugoslavia's President elect has finally begun the process of putting together a government.

From BBC News in London, I am James Cawling for The World. The Yugoslav army has given its support to President elect Vojislav Kostunica. Earlier he had an hour long meeting with former President Slobodan Milosevic. It's the first meeting since Milosevic was ousted by a popular revolt. He conceded defeat and congratulated his successor. Secretary of State, Madeleine Albright says, the lifting of international sanctions against Serbia can now be discussed. Our sanctions regime is not against the people of Serbia, it was against Milosevic. And if Milosevic is gone then there are many ways that the sanctions regime can be changed and lifted and adjusted. Albright says Milosevic must not be allowed to maintain any position of power. Earlier Russia also recognized Kostunica as Yugoslavia's new leader. Visiting foreign minister Evan Holf told Milosevic his time is up.

Today's other top stories: In Yugoslavia where Slobodan Milosevic has told the visiting Russian foreign minister that he does not intend to use force to try to retain power. Milosevic, who was forced out of office when hundreds of thousands of protestors stormed the Parliament building yesterday had something else to say the Russian envoy, something that The World's Jennifer Glass in Belgrade says, bordered on the absurd. The message that Milosevic had was that he wants to remain in politics which seems almost unbelievable, but of course Milosevic over the years as a Balkan leader has been an almost unbelievable man. Here in Belgrade really people seem to care less about what happens to Slobodan Milosevic, now they are just so happy. And this is what they are holding a revolution last night. The streets are just full of people, coming into Friday night full of partying. There is such a festive atmosphere here, you can see it on people's faces. Everyone is out on the street and very happy and excited. Yeah, you can certainly here a lot of commotion. What's happening around there? Can you describe, for instance, what you are hearing from people who you have spoken to there. What are they saying about what is transpiring? Well, right here I'm in Republic Square in front of what was the Parliament building and the windows are broken and the building itself is dark, the people are absolutely jubilant, very, very happy. I spoke to a few of them earlier and they shared their excitement and what a historic couple of days this has been. Hello, how do you feel today? Very exciting and very happy here and our children have a future. So why don't you tell me what has been happening here? Well, last night it was the biggest party of my life. I have never seen so many people smiling here. It was freedom in every way. Last night, the building behind me it was the parliament of Yugoslavia, was inflamed and that building was a symbol of communism I can say. It was beautiful. When we saw it in the smoke, in the flame, we thought it was some kind of symbol of freedom for us. And this building will be free forever. Jennifer, we are hearing behind you what sounds like maybe fireworks or even guns going off. Can you tell us what some of the popping noise is? There are fireworks going off. No gun shots here. There is certainly is no area of violence. You might be hearing them move the barricades behind me. I think what's so remarkable here is it was here yesterday where you saw those remarkable pictures on television and heard on the radio of the crowds. This is where the teargas was fired with the first hints that possibly the crowd and the police might have some sort of confrontation and today no sign of police at all. Here the crowds are policing themselves. Here the only policeman are actually at the front door of the parliament building preventing people from getting into the deserted building, but the crowds here really are just roaming around. It's a very good spirit. There is certainly no feeling of animosity or danger or hatred. I think that there is a real sense of freedom here and that's the people are just celebrating for the first time in more than a decade. They are free to go out, to demonstrate to celebrate, to do what they like. So Jennifer, is there a feeling at all of vindictiveness, of wanting revenge, or people simply happy that there is going to be a change? A lot of the people that I have spoken too so far say they do believe there should be some justice for Slobodan Milosevic, but they are just so happy that there is a change. They are excited that Vojislav Kostunica is their new leader. They are optimistic that he will be able to bring about change because he has united the opposition, the first Serbian politician who has been able to do that here. That has always been the problem. While there has always been a very strong opposition, Milosevic was always able to divide it quite effectively and remain in power. Kostunica has 17 other parties behind him and obviously the will of the people, they are thrilled that he has been increasingly recognized by international leaders including the Russian foreign minister who was here today. So I think that there is a real feeling of change here, a real feeling of excitement and hope that things will go well. Are people around you carrying placards, are they holding things, I mean, can you describe what you are seeing? There are lot of Serbian flags being flown but not a lot of placards. This has really turned away from politics and really into a joyous demonstration. There are few people I have seen with T-shirts putting Kostunica, wearing bumper stickers on their sweaters with the date of the first presidential elections, the elections that brought Kostunica to power, that show that he has the will of the people. But I don't think there are any real political overturns here. It's really just a celebration of freedom. The World's Jennifer Glass speaking to us from Republic Square in front of the parliament building in Belgrade. Thank you very much Jennifer for the update. Always a pleasure Lisa.

as we mentioned tonight, one of the last cold war style dictators out of power, slobodan milosevic, has now conceded defeat in yugoslavia one day after his people and military turned on him in the streets. tonight it appears all over for him. we have two reports this evening. we begin in belgrade. turbulent but exhausted serbs today picking up the pieces of their revolution. day one of what was until yesterday unthinkable, a life not ruled by slobodan milosevic. he stole everything from us, says this man, our house s, our land. thank god we are now free. even slobodan milosevic finally conceding defeat, appearing on tv congratulating cost kft -- congratulating vojislav kostunica on his victory. even saying he would spend time with his family. some celebrateors spent time in the streets, yesterday trashed by protesters. a whole nation of serbs and how to govern in the void left by milosevic. president kostunica helped today by word that sanctions could be lifted as early as next week. there was more good news. a constitutional court and a pledge that it would obey his authority. and in a massive show of support, 2 million people in the streets. the ceremony postponed. instead, a rock concert. followed by an orthodox church blessing. sources said kostunica has other priorities, like what to do about milosevic. to that end, russian envoy eye gore ivanak meeting first with kostunica and then milosevic. the first meeting with the opposition leader since the communist taker. ivanov says milosevic wants to remain a force in national serbian politics. no way say those on yesterday's frontlines. it is over. he is ordinary citizen now. their revolution behind them, serbs, now holding that life after 13 years of life and hardship under milosevic can finally get back to normal. nbc news, belgrade. this is andrea mitchell in washington where officials celebrate the opposition victory. but despite milosevic's remarkable concessions, still worry about him. president clinton calls the outcome astonishing, congratulating kostunica, but rejecting any suggestion that milosevic stay, or even worse, have an official political role in yugoslavia. i think it would be a terrible mistake for him to remain active in the political life of the country. that is not what the people voted for. the u.s. spent $36 billion over the last two years supporting the opposition, but can their victory stand? that could depend on whether russians still give milosevic false hope of a political combat. in moscow today, milosevic's brother. he says he -- his brother will not flea, that he will stay. that, says a foreign minister, is trouble. the next big question, war crimes? milosevic indicted for atrocities in kosovo. today the prosecutor said she's ready for him. i am prepared to receive milosevic in the hague at any time. but that is unlikely. a key milosevic general, rad radford -- rad radford rad -- radavan karadich also still free. they refuse to turn milosevic or the others over. it is important for the future of yugoslavia that they be held accountable and justice be done. but justice takes time. tonight the president is talking to european leaders about ways to lift some demick sanctions on yugoslavia as early as monday as a strong show of support to the new government. andrea mitchell, nbc news, at the state department. with us for more on how this shakes out, richard hass, a veteran of the scounscoun in the bush white house, and an -- veteran of the security council in the bush white house. well, kostunica is the new name american viewers have to get used to. how about a reality check on this guy? he's obviously a lot better than the alternative we have had to live with for more than a decade now, but he is also a national lift, a serb nati onal lift. he -- a serb nationalist. he has resentment against america. as andrea mitchell pointed out, even if milosevic were to stay in the country, this is not somebody that kostunica w ould gladly hand over. he has to balcony opening in the united states and europe at the same time while keeping nationalist credentials. he will not be someone easy to work with. isn't someone somewhere at the state department perhaps in the bowels of the situation room at the white house doing a quiet victory lap tonight? isn't this really just what the u.s. hoped and prayed would happen after the bombing? the sanctions would work, insurrection, and then the leadership would topple? i hope they don't quite do their lap yet. i think it is ok to have your track shoes on, but i wouldn't do any running yet, because what we are seeing is milosevic is out of office, but he has not given up power. and we still have this end game to choreograph. the idea that he would keep a major party role, that, to me, is worriesome because he could pull all sorts of strings behind-the-scenes. so we are not right there. to use another metaphor, the fat lady may be warming up, but too soon for her to be singing. will he have followers? yeah, every day the security and military types will look at what is in the street, they will see how people power is going. also, kostunica has to decide how hard to press. it is one of the things that makes me uneasy about this russian diplomatic intervention. one thing if the russians walk in and say, milosevic, the game is up, you have to leave, and then we start talking about where he goes, but at end of the day, the foreign minister of russia, ivanov, seemed to be offering him some role or space in politics, and that left me a little uneasy. viewers of the presidential debate know this game up -- this came up the other night. if you are clinton of the u.s., do you call putin and say, let this be a test of our relationship and your heat as a world leader. go on in here, here are the talking points, let's have common ground on this new guy? i think that's the way to go and make clear while we would welcome russian involvement, it is conditional. and it is conditional that they give milosevic the right message, and the right message is he's got to go. i would say go means clearly out of politics. i, for one, would be willing to alou him to stay there. i don't have a real problem with pushing the indictment at this time. the key thing is to get this man out of political life and let yugoslav interests constitution -- ultimately, a yugoslav court would be the right to try him. yugoslav is a european country. after a certain amount of time passes, i would imagine the situation would be right to bring people like milosevic to trial. i think the key thing is to allow national jurisdiction to work. after all, that's our position. we are suspicious of international tribunals. so long as yugoslavia were actually involved with a legitimate court, i think the right place to try him is by the yugoslav people. after all, they have paid an enormous price for this guy. lifting sarvingses -- sanctions. is it too much of a message? or is the opposite true, have the sanctions been, as some say in cuba, hurting the wrong people? i think we ought to say what the trigger would be, and the trigger would be milosevic out of political life and then we can relieve sanctions. richard haass, thank you very much. thank you, brian.

I'm Dave Deforest, VOA News. Tens of thousands of Serbs have taken to the streets of towns and cities throughout Yugoslavia to celebrate as President-elect Vojislav Kostunica prepares to take office. Outgoing President Slobodan Milosevic congratulated Mr. Kostunica in a Friday television appearance. We get the latest from VOA correspondent Eve Cornette in Belgrade. Slobodan Milosevic appeared on Serbian television to announce he had just received official information recognizing the electoral victory of Vojislav Kostunica. Mr. Milosevic said I believe this decision must be respected and for the first time describes the opposition leader as President-elect. But he said he would not ignore the support of those who did vote for him in election of September 24th and would therefore lead his forces to become a strong opposition party, which he said would win convincingly in the next round of elections. Mr. Kostunica said he met with Mr. Milosevic and described the talks as positive because he said there was a lot of concern over the peaceful transfer of power. Yugoslavia's army chief congratulated Mr. Kostunica on his victory and assured television viewers the armed forces would support Yugoslavia's new leader. Eve Cornette, VOA News, Belgrade. President Clinton called Yugoslavia's popular uprising against Slobodan Milosevic as an extraordinary victory for the Serbian people. The People there have done an astonishing thing. This is just as big a blow for freedom as we saw when the Berlin Wall was torn down and when the Laquawensa led the shipyard workers in Poland, when the transformations occurred in all these other former communist countries. And it reverses a ten-year effort. It is an extraordinary day. Mr. Clinton pledged Friday that the United States and its allies would work together to lift sanctions to bring Yugoslavia out of isolation. The European community wants to lift sanctions as early as Monday.

Ivory Coast's Supreme Court has rejected the candidacy of Opposition leader Alassane Ouattara, Head of this month's presidential elections. VOA's Luis Ramirez reports the announcement was made as the West African country came under a curfew and a state of emergency. The much-awaited announcement was delivered on state television after Ivory Coast's military government reminded viewers that the curfew would be strictly enforced. The Ivorian Supreme Court said it rejected Mr. Ouattara's candidacy based on what it said was his inability to prove that he is a full Ivorian national as mandated by a newly approved constitution. The elections on October 22nd are to return Ivory Coast to civilian rule, following the country's first coup last December. The coup put General Robert Guei in power. Mr. Gay is among five out of 19 candidates who are being allowed to run. The curfew was put in force after supporters of Mr. Ouattara vowed to retaliate if his candidacy was rejected. Luis Ramirez, VOA News, Abidjan. Meanwhile, Mr. Ouattara has appealed for calm. He said he was shocked by the court decision, but pleaded with his supporters to resist violence.

Welcome to another hour of news and information on the Voice of America. I'm David Chadwick with VOA News now. President Clinton is criticizing a proposal to open up food and medicine sales to Cuba, but toughen restrictions on travel there. VOA's David Swan reports, the House of Representatives is expected to vote on the measure next week. Mr. Clinton says he will withhold final judgment until he sees details of the plan, which members of Congress hammered out Thursday night. But he tells reporters that if the deal was what it appears to be, the lawmakers made a big mistake. It looks like it eases the embargo on food and medicine, but it probably doesn't very much because it doesn't provide any financing credits, which we give to other poor countries, whereas it definitely restricts the ability of the executive branch to increase people-to-people contacts between Americans and Cubans. The agreement which is part of a larger foreign bill, came after more than a year of political warfare and bargaining over the always sensitive subject of Cuba. The measure would allow American food and medicine to be sold there for the first time in close to 40 years. It also applies to four other nations where trade has been restricted, Iran, Sudan, Libya and North Korea. But Cuban-American house members who fiercely oppose anything that might ease pressure on President Castro demanded concessions. So, as Mr. Clinton noted, the plan bars American banks from financing the food sales, which means Havana would have to pay cash or obtain credits from third countries. Another part of the legislation would tighten restrictions on American travel to Cuba. The Castro government has already rejected the deal, saying it will not buy anything under these terms. In contrast, the proposal supporters call it an opening to Cuba and an important shift in policy. One leading pharm group, the American Pharm Bureau Federation describes it as a positive first step and much better than current law. It appears Congress is not prepared to take any bigger steps on the issue this year. David Swan, VOA News, Capitol Hill.

From VOA News now, Communications World, a review of electronic media with Dr. Kim Andrew Elliot. Welcome to Communications World for the weekend of October 7th 2000. In this program a look at the artistic side of radio and audio, including a wonderful collage of short wave broadcasts from the cold war era. The vestiges of the cold war have been playing out in the dramatic events this past week in Belgrade. The broadcast media were among the key objectives of the demonstrators who wrested control of television stations. The media in Serbia, formally loyal or at least obedient to Slobodan Milosevic, quickly changed their perspective this past week. Even the Tan Yug news agency in Belgrade said Thursday that it has sided with the people and will now report truthfully and objectively. With its short wave coverage presently suspended, we can't hear Radio Yugoslavia through that medium, my attempts to hear internet-streamed audio from Radio Yugoslavia, as well as from domestic radio stations in Serbia have so far been unsuccessful. You listeners in Europe within earshot of Serbian medium wave stations have a better vantage point. In fact, Khai Ludwig tells me that he was able to hear RTS on 648 and 1008. He said the content was not of any spectacular take over, rather the news and music of a just liberated broadcaster. Earlier this week, some employees of Radio Yugoslavia, the external service were fired and ejected from their headquarters for signing a petition calling for more openness in the station's coverage of the September election and by Thursday 300 employees of Serbian State Broadcaster RTS were on strike to support the recognition of the opposition victory in that election. The Association of Independent Electronic Media in Serbia claims its satellite signal used to feed local television stations was jammed Thursday when it began reporting on the protest scenes in Belgrade.

Ousted Yugoslav leader Slobodan Milosevic conceded defeat Friday in presidential elections, a day after protesters angry at him for clinging to power stormed Belgrade's parliament in support of his democratic rival and ended his long autocratic regime. The speech acknowledging the victory of president-elect Vojislav Kostunica triggered a huge celebration on the streets of the Yugoslav capital. Firecrackers were exploding and horns honking throughout the city. ``I congratulate Mr. Kostunica on his electoral victory and I wish much success to all citizens of Yugoslavia,'' Milosevic said in the television address. ``I intend to rest a bit and spend some more time with my family and especially with my grandson Marko and after that to help my party gain force and contribute to future prosperity.'' Milosevic's concession came in the wake of pronouncements that helped Kostunica consolidate his new power. Yugoslavia's high court named him the election winner, powerful Yugoslav ally Russia offered its support and the army indicated to the president-elect that it would obey the new political authority. Army chief of staff Nebojsa Pavkovic, a former Milosevic crony, expressed confidence that Kostunica will help ``overcome all the remaining problems in a civilized way and return the country to normalcy,'' Tanjug news agency reported. He also pledged that the army will carry its duties according to the constitution. Friday's developments appeared to complete the stunningly swift downfall of Milosevic's regime. On Thursday, hundreds of thousands of people converged on Belgrade in protest against the longtime leader. Milosevic started and lost four wars in the Balkans during his 13 years in power, and sanctions imposed by the United Nations, the United States and Europe have left much of Yugoslavia impoverished and isolated. Milosevic's concession speech signaled that he has abandoned hopes of blocking Kostunica from taking his oath, possibly Saturday, and instead will try to carve out a role for himself in Yugoslav political life. As an indicted war criminal, Milosevic has little chance of seeking asylum abroad and has no choice but to try to reach an accommodation with the new government. Kostunica said Friday that he had spoken to Milosevic, though he offered no details. And Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov met with Milosevic at a government villa in Belgrade. Milosevic ``said he intends to play a prominent role in the political life of the country,'' Ivanov said. During the meeting, Milosevic ``stressed the importance of solving the crisis through peaceful ways and that the use of force should be avoided,'' Ivanov told reporters. Milosevic had not been seen since mobs rampaged through the capital Thursday in a display of rage unprecedented in Yugoslavia's 55-year history. The protesters roared through the parliament building and the state broadcasting center. When the violence subsided, it was clear that control belonged to Kostunica. Wild celebrations stretched well into Friday. Other events Friday confirmed the grip of the 56-year-old law professor. Ivanov carried a message from Russian President Vladimir Putin that ``congratulated Mr. Kostunica on his victory in the presidential elections.'' The act removed the last possibility of any important international backing for the fading Milosevic: Russia was the last major European nation to withhold support for Kostunica. ``This is great news,'' said U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who called it ``very, very important.'' Later, in another significant boost, the nation's Constitutional Court notified the anti-Milosevic coalition that it had declared Kostunica the new president-elect. The court, once considered a puppet of Milosevic, killed any legal claim by the former strongman. The speaker of the Serbian parliament, Dragan Tomic, addressed Kostunica as president in a letter. It was the first such recognition by a high official from the Socialist Party of Serbia led by Milosevic. With state media already calling Kostunica ``president'' and his supporters ferreting out Milosevic cronies in state institutions, all that's left is a formal inauguration. Kostunica's aides say that could come as early as Saturday. About 200,000 people gathered in front of the charred parliament Friday. One of their posters read: ``Slobodan, are you counting your last minutes.'' ``We are gradually getting back to normal and I believe the crisis is behind us,'' Kostunica said. Milosevic is blamed by the West for starting _ and then losing _ the four Balkan wars which broke out in the last decade when parts of Yugoslavia began to seek independence. Those conflicts were marked by horrific acts of violence against civilians, which prompted Western governments to impose sanctions and isolate Belgrade. Some of those controls were eased after Milosevic signed the 1995 agreement to end the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina. However, other sanctions were imposed again in 1998 after Milosevic launched a brutal crackdown on ethnic Albanians in Kosovo. In the last day, though, both the United States and the European Union have said they will begin to lift sanctions as the new democratic administration takes the reins. French President Jacques Chirac invited Kostunica to join leaders from the 15 EU nations at a summit in the French coastal city of Biarritz on Oct. 13-14. It could offer Kostunica a prime opportunity to seek foreign investment and other aid. But returning Yugoslavia to normal footing may pose its own dilemmas. The sanctions and years of Balkan warfare has left the economy in ruins. Last year's 78-day NATO bombardment hammered an already creaky transportation and utility network. Kostunica was putting together a stopgap crisis committee to try to stabilize the country. Somehow he will also have to work with close Milosevic allies, such as powerful Serbian President Milan Milutinovic. Like Milosevic, Milutinovic was indicted by the international war crimes tribunal for the offensive against ethnic Albanians in Kosovo. Kostunica could come under strong Western pressure to turn over indicted war criminals. Milosevic's pledge to remain could add even more complications. Officials in Washington were not pleased with the idea of Milosevic remaining on the political scene. They want to see him on trial in The Hague. ``The first step in the process of removing him from power,'' said Sandy Berger, the U.S. national security adviser. ``I would not want to see him playing a role in Serb political affairs.'' Despite the details left to be played out, Western leaders were rejoicing Friday. British Prime Minister Tony Blair said it appeared ``the era of Milosevic is over.'' ``This is the day of real rejoicing in the world and Europe and, most of all, in Serbia,'' he said.

President Clinton expressed reservations Friday about Republican proposals to allow wholesalers to reimport low-cost prescription drugs and to ease trade sanctions on Cuba, a day after House and Senate negotiators gave both proposals their approval. Clinton also chastised Republican leaders for disregarding House and Senate votes favoring a measure to make hate-motivated attacks on gays a federal crime and instead rejecting the proposal during internal budget negotiations. ``It was plain wrong,'' he said. ``I pledge to keep fighting for hate crimes legislation this year.'' Late Thursday evening, House and Senate negotiators approved language on a larger agriculture spending bill to permit the sale of food, medicine and fertilizer to Cuba, Iran, Sudan, Libya and North Korea. But in the case of Cuba, the bill would place severe restrictions on financing, prohibiting both U.S. banks and the government from extending credit or loans. Cuba, a poor country, would have to either pay in cash or secure a loan from a foreign bank, probably at high interest rates. The proposal would also turn into law existing regulations that bar American tourists, among others, from visiting Cuba. Farmers, agribusiness and pharmaceutical companies had lobbied heavily for opening these markets in Cuba and the other countries. The pressure to act was acute among Farm Belt Republicans, especially Rep. Tom Nethercutt of Washington state, who is in a tight race for re-election. But two Republican Cuban-American lawmakers from Florida, a major battleground in the November election, managed to win major concessions from Republican leaders on financing and on travel to Cuba. Bill Reed, a spokesman for Riceland, an Arkansas-based rice cooperative, said officials there were still reviewing the bill. ``While we applaud the spirit of the proposal, at this time we are not confident about the language implications,'' he said. Clinton, who said he was keeping an open mind, said Friday that he was not sure the bill would really help farmers. ``What I have been told,'' he said, ``is it looks like it eases the embargo on food and medicine, but it probably doesn't very much, because it doesn't provide any financing credits, which we give to other poor countries.'' ``It certainly restricts in, I think, a completely unwarranted way,'' he added, ``the ability of the United States to make travel decisions on policy that I do not believe should be made, written in law, in stone by the Congress. I think it's wrong.'' Farmers stand to benefit most from exports of food and medicine to Iran, Sudan, Libya and North Korea. The president can, through waivers, permit U.S. banks and the government to finance those exports. Clinton also said he was ``deeply disappointed'' by the Republican plan to permit U.S.-made prescription drugs to be reimported into the United States by pharmacies and wholesalers to be sold at discounted prices. Republicans and Democrats had been holding bipartisan meetings on the issue, but on Wednesday, Republicans broke away and wrote their own legislation, which they say addressed many Democratic concerns. The bill includes a five-year expiration date and language that Democrats say is too fuzzy and would give drug makers too much power. The bill, Clinton said, ``is more acceptable to the drug companies, all right,'' but does little to help seniors and others who cannot afford drugs. While saying he was still reviewing the language, he urged Congress to ``work in a genuine spirit of bipartisanship.'' On a separate spending bill, Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M, said the Senate would not try to override the president's expected veto of a $23.6 billion measure to finance energy and water projects.

The Clinton administration is embracing Yugoslav President-elect Vojislov Kostunica as a democrat who offers new hope for Serbs, setting aside concerns that Slobodan Milosevic's successor has had little regard for U.S. policies in the Balkans. Those policies include participation in U.N. administration of Kosovo, support for independence-minded Montenegro and demands for the prosecution of Milosevic for war crimes. ``I know what President Kostunica has said, and I know him to be a Serb nationalist,'' Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said Friday as Milosevic's regime crumbled amid a mass public uprising. But she quickly added, ``I also know that he is not a former communist, and I also know that he does not believe that dealing with Serbia's policies includes ethnic cleansing and the devastation of the rights of those that are not ethnic Serbs.'' In the strongest show of support for Kostunica, the administration signaled that it intends to move quickly in concert with European allies to remove the economic sanctions imposed to punish Milosevic. ``Now is not the time for the United States or our allies to retreat from the Balkans in complacency,'' President Clinton said. ``Now is the time to stay the course and stick with people who have won their freedom, the time to build the economic and civil institutions that will allow democracy to endure, reconciliation and cooperation to develop, and the economy to grow.'' Despite that assertion, Albright warned that the lifting of sanctions might be reconsidered if Milosevic manages to carve out a role for himself in the new government. Milosevic, in finally conceding defeat late Friday, promised to return to politics after a rest. Kostunica has said he won't extradite Milosevic to face war crimes charges in The Hague. Albright and other U.S. officials pointed out that this country does not always agree with every government with which it maintains relations. It's ``anybody's guess what the relationship will turn out to be,'' said State Department spokesman Richard Boucher. ``The Serbian people are moving in a certain direction,'' Boucher said. ``We've pledged our full support for them to move in that direction. We're looking. We expect and know that many others in the international community are on the same foot.'' While drawing support in the West as he quickly emerged as an alternative to Milosevic, Kostunica continued to blast Western actions in the Balkans. Maintaining a distance from the West even after the election, he accused Washington and the West of ``creating a cult of Slobodan Milosevic'' by dealing with him as if he were Serbia, by bombing Serbia for 78 days to force the return of ethnic Albanians to Kosovo, and by imposing a decade of sanctions that Kostunica said only prolonged Milosevic's grip over the globally isolated Serbs. In his refusal to extradite Milosevic, the president-elect called the U.N. war crimes tribunal in The Hague a ``political institution'' with inconsistent rules, and an ``American tool.'' He also has warned that Yugoslavia will not become ``anybody's protectorate,'' apparently referring to Kosovo's status under the United Nations and NATO. Kosovo was a Serb province before the bombing. Serbia's partner in the Yugoslav federation, Montenegro, will remain part of the country under Kostunica, but its leaders refused to participate in the election, leaving their relations with Yugoslavia's new leader in doubt. The United States has supported Montenegro's leaders but not its independence. U.S. officials find comfort in the fact that Kostunica rose to power on a democratic tide and laud his calls for normalized relations with the world, including participation in the United Nations, the International Monetary Fund and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. ``Look at his bio, his commitment to the rule of law and European integration,'' said a senior official, briefing reporters on condition of anonymity. The official pointed out that Kostunica never cut a deal with Milosevic and never worked for the Yugoslav leader. Kostunica, 56, emerged to unify the Serb opposition after leading a small opposition party. He was kicked out of Belgrade Law School in 1974 for his anti-communist views and became active in the upstart opposition movement in the early 1990. While calling for peace with Europe and the rest of the world, he promised to stand up for the Serb minority and work for the return of Serbs driven out of Kosovo with the NATO bombing. He also backed Bosnian Serbs in their 1991-95 war to secede. But he never supported Milosevic's expulsion of non-Serbs from neighboring republics and has said ``being Serbian doesn't mean being anti-American.''

With the army behind him and Slobodan Milosevic wishing him well, Vojislav Kostunica was poised to take his presidential oath and begin leading Yugoslavia out of a decade of war and turmoil and into a welcoming Europe. The inaugural ceremony was scheduled to begin Saturday afternoon in Belgrade's city hall, across the street from the gutted and ransacked federal parliament building, the scene of Milosevic's last stand. A day after angry protesters battled their way into parliament and ousted his regime, Milosevic addressed the Yugoslav people in a televised speech late Friday, conceding he had lost Sept. 24 presidential elections. ``I congratulate Mr. Kostunica on his electoral victory and I wish much success to all citizens of Yugoslavia,'' Milosevic said. The speech signaled the Yugoslav president has abandoned hopes of preventing Kostunica from being sworn into office. Hours after Milosevic's address, the army's chief of staff, Nebojsa Pavkovic, also congratulated Kostunica, and indicated the military would obey the new political authority. Yugoslavia's high court had also named Kostunica the election winner and powerful Yugoslav ally Russia offered its support earlier in the day. In his speech, Milosevic said he wanted to take a break, before restarting an active political life. As an indicted war criminal, he has little chance of seeking asylum abroad and has no choice but to try to reach an accommodation with the new government. ``I intend to rest a bit and spend some more time with my family and especially with my grandson, Marko, and after that to help my party gain force and contribute to future prosperity,'' he said. The concession prompted bursts of gunfire and wild honking of car horns in the streets of Belgrade, where tens of thousands kept up celebrations that began Thursday in the wake of a tumultuous uprising against 13 year's of Milosevic's autocratic rule. Greek Foreign Minister George Papandreou arrived in Belgrade on Saturday, the Greek Embassy said. Igor Ivanov, Russia's foreign minister, held talks with both Kostunica and Milosevic on Friday. Norway's foreign minister, Thorbjoern Jagland, was due to follow in his Greek counterpart's footsteps and arrive here later Saturday, in a further show of support for Kostunica. Further confirming Kostunica's position, the speaker of the Serbian parliament, Dragan Tomic, addressed Kostunica as president in a letter Friday _ the first such recognition by a high official from Milosevic's Socialist Party of Serbia. But some anti-Milosevic leaders, like Zoran Djindjic, reacted to the president's remarks with caution. ``I don't trust him,'' Djindjic said. ``I think he is preparing positions for a stab in the back by consolidating police, creating chaos and returning to power with a strong hand.'' Milosevic is blamed by the West for starting _ and then losing _ four Balkan wars which broke out in the last decade when parts of Yugoslavia began to seek independence. Those conflicts were marked by horrific acts of violence against civilians, which prompted Western governments to impose sanctions and isolate Belgrade. Some of those controls were eased after Milosevic signed the 1995 agreement to end the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina. However, other sanctions were imposed again in 1998 after Milosevic launched a brutal crackdown on ethnic Albanians in Kosovo. Pavkovic, a former Milosevic crony, expressed confidence that Kostunica will help ``overcome all the remaining problems in a civilized way and return the country to normalcy,'' Tanjug news agency reported. He also pledged that the army will carry its duties according to the constitution. In recent days, both the United States and the European Union have said they will begin to lift sanctions as the new democratic administration takes the reins. ``This is great news,'' Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said about Kostunica's apparent victory, calling it ``very, very important.'' French President Jacques Chirac invited Kostunica to join leaders from the 15 EU nations at a summit in the French coastal city of Biarritz on Oct. 13-14. It could offer Kostunica a prime opportunity to seek foreign investment and other aid. But returning Yugoslavia to normal footing may pose its own dilemmas.

Somehow he will also have to work with close Milosevic allies, such as powerful Serbian President Milan Milutinovic. Like Milosevic, Milutinovic was indicted by the international war crimes tribunal for the offensive against ethnic Albanians in Kosovo. Kostunica could come under strong Western pressure to turn over indicted war criminals.

In the mid-1990s, when the United States was trying to end the war in Bosnia and then enforce the peace, Washington's contacts with Slobodan Milosevic were frequent, volatile and very much in person. Often, after a shouting match over policy with American diplomats in his palace in Belgrade, Milosevic would signal a servant to open the doors to a large dining room, where a meal of several courses awaited and where the conversation could be, according to participants, jocular and cordial. Relations with Milosevic at that period were never warm, but were at the height of a roller-coaster ride that coursed over a decade from a lack of attention during a Bush presidency distracted first by the fall of Communism elsewhere, and then by fighting Saddam Hussein, to outright war last year under President Clinton. Now, finally, Washington is celebrating the downfall of a man who for years delighted in defying, befuddling and belittling his far more powerful foes. As the Clinton administration tries to temper its relish, senior officials are looking back at an opponent _ the last of the major East European strongmen _ who has caused as many internal debates and as much anguish in Washington as any other. Some of the skirmishes were between the secretary of state, Madeleine Albright, who with her Czechoslovakian origins and childhood memories of Belgrade holds a special kinship to the Balkans and Eastern Europe, and the ambassador to the United Nations, Richard Holbrooke, a forceful diplomat who orchestrated the unpalatable deal with Milosevic to end the war in Bosnia. From the beginning, these kinds of diplomatic differences marked Washington's relations with Yugoslavia. In 1990 and 1991, the ambassador to Yugoslavia, Warren Zimmerman, felt that the Bush administration, distracted by the Persian Gulf War, made too little effort, too late, to stop the brewing conflict in Yugoslavia. Secretary of State James Baker said in 1991 that the United States did ``not have a dog in that fight,'' that Washington's national interest was not centered on the Balkans and that it was unwise to commit American troops there. In 1992, while running for the presidency, Clinton seemed to suggest that he would do more to confront Milosevic and the Bosnian Serbs, who were besieging Sarajevo, the Bosnian capital, and conducting the worst killing in Europe since World War II. Once in power, the Clinton administration wanted little to do with the conflict, which it regarded as Europe's business and which it believed could be contained by U.N. sanctions imposed on Yugoslavia in 1992. In congressional testimony, Secretary of State Warren Christopher called the killing in Bosnia ``a problem from hell.'' In a tentative foray into the Balkans in 1993, Christopher, who never seemed persuaded by what he was trying to sell, went to Europe to persuade the allies to agree to a ``lift and strike'' policy. This called for the lifting of an arms embargo that had been placed on all of former Yugoslavia _ thus giving the well-armed Serbs an automatic advantage over the outgunned Bosnian Muslims _ and the launching of strategic NATO airstrikes at Bosnian Serb targets. The British and French, who had troops in Bosnia as part of a U.N. force, objected strongly to airstrikes, and the Clinton White House backed off. By 1995, with the killing in Bosnia under way for three years and unpunished, the Clinton administration looked for a way to end the conflict. The engagement with Milosevic turned from sporadic contact to full-fledged diplomatic involvement. First, though, the administration had to make a critical decision. Should it deal with Milosevic, the mastermind of the war, or with his surrogates, the Bosnian Serbs, led by Radovan Karadzic? To decide that question, a diplomat with an uncanny skill for dealing with ugly regimes, Robert Frasure, was dispatched to Belgrade, where he held lengthy talks and had many meals with Milosevic. Frasure, who had negotiated with the Marxist dictator of Ethiopia _ Mengistu Haile Mariam _ who eventually fled his country, and then with the ruling white regime in South Africa that ultimately collapsed, recommended dealing directly with the boss of the Balkans, Milosevic. Frasure was one of four Americans killed when their armored personnel carrier drove over a mountainside in Bosnia as Holbrooke, Gen. Wesley Clark and other officials took a perilous road into Sarajevo because Bosnian Serb guns made it too dangerous to fly. Holbrooke then began a dizzying flurry of talks, meeting Milosevic as NATO launched its first sustained airstrikes against Bosnian Serb targets in September 1995. The negotiations culminated in the Dayton accords, reached at an Ohio Air Force Base that November and signed in Paris in December 1995. Critics charged that the administration became too close to Milosevic, treating him as part of the solution to the war, rather than part of the problem. At the time, there were arguments within the administration about whether sanctions against Milosevic should be eased. As ambassador to the United Nations, Albright was strongly opposed, as was Vice President Al Gore's top foreign policy adviser, Leon Fuerth. During this period, all kinds of American officials visited Milosevic, including senators and House members, who would be shown on Serbian television _ lending, for Milosevic's purposes, authenticity to his reign. After the Dayton deal, which resulted in the dispatch of more than 30,000 peacekeeping troops to Bosnia, Holbrooke, and then the assistant secretary for European affairs, John Kornblum, continued to visit Belgrade. Their purpose was to persuade Milosevic to get his acolytes in the Serbian part of Bosnia to live up to their commitments at Dayton, including allowing Muslims hounded out of their homes to return. On one occasion, however, Milosevic delivered. In mid-1996, at Holbrooke's request, he engineered Karadzic's removal from office. By early 1998, Milosevic, as many feared, began to stir again, this time in the Serbian province of Kosovo, where a large Albanian majority began an armed rebellion against years of repression by the Yugoslav Army and Serbian police. Again, as in Bosnia, Milosevic's forces committed massacres and drove out thousands of Albanian families. In October 1998, Holbrooke returned to Belgrade to reason with the strongman. The upshot, after more than 10 days of argument and the threat of NATO bombing, was an agreement that allowed outside, unarmed monitors into Kosovo to observe a truce between the Serbian forces and the growing Kosovo Liberation Army. A massacre by Serbs in the Albanian village of Racak in January 1999 decisively broke the truce. By then Albright had decided that only force could bring Milosevic, now in charge of a diminished and isolated Serbia, under control. She argued strenuously at the White House for building a NATO consensus that if Milosevic did not agree to a NATO peacekeeping force in Kosovo he would be punished with airstrikes. She had also concluded that Yugoslavia, where she had walked the streets as a child when her father was the Czechoslovakian ambassador to Belgrade, could not be a normal country with Milosevic at the helm. (Her only encounter with Milosevic _ in May 1997 in Belgrade as part of a tour of the Balkans as Secretary of State _ was, according to aides, confrontational and blunt.) With the war in Kosovo over, Milosevic remained in power, though indicted for war crimes by the International Criminal Tribunal in The Hague. Albright made no secret of her desire to see him go. She argued that the Serbs, and Europe, needed and deserved better. When Milosevic announced in July that he was holding direct elections for the presidency on Sept. 24, Washington had already prepared some ground by financing civic groups and independent media opposed to his regime. This support was rapidly fortified and an anti-Milosevic operation, intended to keep in contact with the opposition movement, was established under the American ambassador, William Montgomery, in Budapest. But the administration had to be careful. The opposition presidential candidate, Vojislav Kostunica, was fiercely independent and critical of American policy in Kosovo and Bosnia. In the end, the sweeping anti-Milosevic election result and the strength of the sentiment on the streets of Belgrade late this week were the work of the people. For Holbrooke, Milosevic was ``the arsonist of south-central Europe.'' ``As long as he was in power, you couldn't deal with the problems there,'' he said. ``Now he has gone, the real problems will emerge, but at least you can deal with them.'' Holbrooke, who has dealt with Milosevic more than any other American official, cautioned that Milosevic's quick decision to stay in political life would be ``vastly complicating.'' For Albright, the show of people power was a moment of vindication. She learned of Milosevic's collapse as she flew toward Washington after a disheartening round of Middle East talks. She was asked how his departure ranked among her moments in office. ``This is something very personal to me,'' she said, standing in the aisle of the secretary of state's plane. ``I have always felt very strongly that the Serbian people were terrific. They had gotten a lousy deal by being ruled by Milosevic.''

As violent clashes continued unabated Saturday between Israelis and Palestinians, the anger that has churned across the Middle East since the violence began the week before last suggested that the polarization of Muslim opinion may have sharply reduced prospects for an overall peace settlement, even if the violence can be curbed. Not since the Oslo peace efforts began in 1993 has the region seen such widespread turmoil. The angry crowds that have marched in capitals like Baghdad and Tehran, hotbeds of hostility toward Israel, have been matched by protests in nations that have moved in recent years toward an acceptance of Israel's existence, including oil-rich monarchies in the Persian Gulf like Kuwait, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates. Arab countries that have signed peace agreements with Israel, or opened trade and diplomatic ties, have found themselves roiled by popular anger. In the Jordanian capital, Amman, troops opened fire on Palestinian refugees on Friday who were demanding the closure of the Israeli Embassy in Jordan. An 18-year-old Palestinian was killed, but Jordanian authorities said Saturday that he was the victim of a ``settling of accounts'' between rival Palestinian groups, not of police gunfire. On Wednesday, King Abdullah II _ who met twice in August with the Israeli prime minister, Ehud Barak, urging both sides in the Israeli-Palestinian dispute not to miss the chance of reaching a final peace accord _ visited a clinic in Amman to donate blood for Palestinian casualties of the violence. Jordan, like Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and several other Arab nations, announced that its hospitals were available to treat any Palestinian wounded. An Arab businessman in Dubai placed a newspaper advertisement to announce plans to ship 50 truckloads of stones and 500,000 slingshots overland to Jordan for use by Palestinian protesters. Elsewhere in the Middle East, there have been scores of mass marches, campus protests and officially sponsored rallies. Crowds of 10,000 and more have gathered in Cairo, Baghdad, Beirut and Tehran, among other places. Governments that routinely ban protests have turned a blind eye. In the Syrian capital, Damascus, on Wednesday, 1,000 students pelted the U.S. Embassy with stones, branches and bags of rubbish, and one man managed to haul down the American flag. At the American University in Cairo, also on Wednesday, students plucked the American flag from the main administration building and replaced it briefly with a black-and-white Palestinian kaffiyeh, or head scarf. One measure of the changed mood across the Arab world was Egypt's announcement on Friday that it would convene an emergency Arab summit meeting in Cairo on Oct. 21 and 22, and that the nations attending would include Iraq, which has not attended an Arab summit meeting since before the Persian Gulf war. Although President Saddam Hussein has not confirmed that he will lead the Iraqi delegation in person, Arab diplomats in Cairo said that the decision to include Iraq marked a major shift, and reflected a wider momentum across the Arab world to break with the U.S.-led drive to maintain Iraq's isolation. More broadly, the clashes that have killed more than 80 Palestinians appear to have crystallized a widespread disillusionment among Arab and Muslim nations with the proposed peace settlement that the United States has pushed since the abortive Camp David summit meeting that President Clinton held in July. Arab leaders generally have viewed the proposals as weighted against the Palestinians, especially on the key issue of Jerusalem. Their reluctance to accept the proposals appears to have hardened, during the recent violence, into a resolve to oppose them more openly. The Egyptian president, Hosni Mubarak, a key player in Middle East diplomacy for nearly 20 years, issued one of his starkest warnings on Saturday, telling Egypt's army newspaper in an interview that the settlement being urged by Washington ``would be a time bomb that would explode in the faces of all.'' In an interview on Egyptian state television on Friday, Mubarak continued in the same vein. He criticized Israel for what he called ``excessive force'' against ``unarmed'' Palestinians and called on the Jewish state to ``stop your provocations.'' He added: ``The Palestinians throw rocks, while you'' _ meaning the Israelis _ ``fire live bullets at them and even rockets from aircraft.'' He also criticized the Israeli prime minister, Ehud Barak, for rejecting an international inquiry into the violence, saying: ``But Barak says `no.' I do not understand. Israel wants to stand up against the whole world.'' Mubarak, facing a restive Islamic movement in Egypt, is profoundly sensitive to wider currents in the Arab world, and these were running strongly against the Camp David proposals before the explosion of the worst Israeli-Palestinian violence in years. The Egyptian leader has warned that Arafat would face assassination if he ceded to U.S. pressures on East Jerusalem, and some Arabs see this as a coded reminder from Mubarak that he, too, has escaped assassination attempts by Islamic radicals angered at Egypt's accommodation with Israel since 1978. Elsewhere in the Middle East, the events in Gaza and the West Bank have stirred similar outpourings of hostility to Israel from its old enemies. In Baghdad on Wednesday, Saddam, meeting with university teachers, said that Iraq, if given access to a border strip adjoining Israel, would lead a ``sacred Arab force'' in liberating the Muslim holy sites. And in Lebanon, Sheik Hassan Nasrallah, leader of the Islamic fundamentalist Hezbollah, told a Beirut rally on Wednesday that Palestinians should stop firing into the air and ``save their bullets for the chests of the Zionists, soldiers and settlers.''

Vojislav Kostunica, whose shoe-leather campaign and dour honesty made him the choice of a nation fed up with Slobodan Milosevic, was sworn in Saturday as the new Yugoslav president. Kostunica, a 56-year-old constitutional lawyer, won presidential elections on Sept. 24 and was propelled into leadership by a stunningly swift popular revolution. But he got a swift foretaste on Saturday of the difficulties that he now confronts. The scene was chaotic at the modern conference center chosen to replace the federal Parliament building, which was burned last week in the revolt that made Milosevic cede the presidency. Newly elected legislators who had gathered for the inauguration of Kostunica and their own swearing-in negotiated furiously about a future federal government. The wrangling was one result of a half-finished revolution that could swiftly bog down in legal wrangling and political bargaining. Supported by a loose coalition of 18 disparate and notoriously quarrelsome opposition parties, Kostunica now faces the daunting task of constructing a new government and institutionalizing the revolution while keeping to the legal order he cherishes. One of his first problems will be to guide an opposition that has never run anything larger than a city. But he must also work to maintain the Yugoslav Federation over which he presides. He must deal with the problem of the restive, small republic of Montenegro that has moved a long way toward independence and of a Kosovo that is run by the United Nations and whose largely Albanian population wants only to get free of any connection with Belgrade. Kosovo Albanian leaders are unlikely to relinquish that goal even if they come under strong foreign pressure to negotiate with the new Yugoslav president. Kostunica says he will try to establish a unity government of experts on the federal level that could include members of other parties that had backed Milosevic, like the Socialist People's Party from Montenegro, and even Milosevic's party itself. As Kostunica tried to win over the president of Montenegro _ whose boycott of the September elections left his party with no seats in the federal Parliament _ the Montenegrin Socialists indicated that they could remain in coalition with the parties of Milosevic and his wife, which would give them a majority in Parliament. Working out new relationships with the rest of Europe and the United States, which have welcomed Milosevic's downfall with full-throated delight, could be comparatively easy, despite questions over the extradition of Milosevic and other Serbs to The Hague, Netherlands, on war-crimes charges. The West is eager to help Serbia with financial and other aid and has promised to begin lifting some international sanctions against Yugoslavia _ though not the most damaging ones _ as early as Monday. As the federal legislators gathered here Saturday morning, there were reports by witnesses that Milosevic's son, Marko Milosevic, had flown on a Yugoslav Airlines flight to Moscow, YU-132, with his wife, Milica, and his son, Marko. Ida Kovacevic, a flight attendant on the plane, said in an interview after the flight returned here: ``Marko came in as an ordinary passenger. He acted normally, and we acted normally. There was no special treatment.'' She confirmed that his wife and son were also aboard. Belgraders noted gleefully on Saturday that in his resignation speech Friday night, Milosevic said he wanted ``to spend more time with my family, especially my grandson, Marko.'' ``He should go join them soon,'' said Vesna Mitic, standing on Saturday staring at the burned-out Parliament building where the new legislature can no longer meet. But Meri Locani said: ``I wouldn't even let him go to Russia. Why did he let all this happen? If people have a chance, they would hang him and his wife here in the square.'' When she heard Milosevic's resignation speech, Locani said, ``I was so happy, as happy as I've ever been.'' She wiped her eyes. She has a paraplegic daughter, Savina, 27, she said. ``I'd be the happiest person in the world if she could walk. But in the last few days I was so happy. It was almost as if she were walking.'' But Milosevic remains in Serbia with stated ambitions to continue in politics as the leader of his Socialist Party, which makes many uneasy. Aleksandar Tijanic, Milosevic's former spokesman who became a critic of the rule, said Saturday, ``As long as Milosevic remains on the Serbian political scene and shows a desire to be politically active, he represents a threat.'' Milosevic ``represents the political interests'' of all those not in the democratic opposition, Tijanic said in an interview. But more important, ``he's also the supreme commander of the net of paramilitaries, parapolice and parafinancial interests'' that have thrived with and supported him and his wife, Mirjana Markovic. ``Milosevic can pull some strings,'' Tijanic said. ``These cannot bring down the new government, but can keep it in constant instability and keep the public of Serbia in a constant state of tension.'' One of Kostunica's main challenges, Tijanic said, is to enforce his authority over the opposition coalition, some of whose leaders want a revolutionary bypassing of the law. ``He should break down party interests in the coalition, because he won as the candidate of Serbian political opinion, and not as their candidate,'' he said. The more powerful Yugoslavian Parliament, which has supported Milosevic and whose members are not scheduled to face election until next year, is to meet on Monday. Maneuvering there with two parties that have been sometime allies of Milosevic could alter the face of the Yugoslavian government, but exactly who will now control that legislature remains uncertain. On Monday, the Yugoslavian Parliament will recognize Kostunica and may vote to fire the Yugoslavian interior minister, Vlajko Stojiljkovic, a Milosevic ally. The Parliament may also abolish the draconian information law passed in October 1998. But Kostunica and his allies must also begin to control the Yugoslavian ministries that are now beholden to Milosevic and his coalition. The opposition is moving ``minister by minister, institution by institution,'' trying to establish cooperation, a party leader said. New details emerged Saturday of Milosevic's meeting on Friday with Kostunica, after Foreign Minister Igor S. Ivanov of Russia met the two men and Milosevic decided to concede defeat in the elections. On Friday evening, Kostunica received the Yugoslav military chief of staff, Gen. Nebojsa Pavkovic, at presidential offices in the Palace of Federations in New Belgrade. Pavkovic promised him that the army would not intervene and congratulated him on his election victory, which makes Kostunica chairman of the country's Supreme Defense Council. Pavkovic then offered to show Kostunica the military command post, in a suburban Belgrade bunker, said Stevan Niksic, the editor of the weekly NIN. Once there, the general asked if Kostunica would like to meet Milosevic. The two men talked alone for an hour, Kostunica said on television on Friday night. The Greek and Norwegian foreign ministers flew to Belgrade on Saturday for the hastily arranged inauguration ceremony. The Greek minister, George Papandreou, and his government have tried to be intermediaries between Yugoslavia and Europe, and between Kostunica and the Milosevic government. Papandreou said the end of Milosevic's rule ushers in ``a new era in relations between Yugoslavia and Europe.''

The chubby man in the red track suit didn't know it, but he was about to make history. Something _ frustration, rage or just the heat of the moment _ drove him through a surprised knot of riot police and onto the steps of the federal parliament. For a moment, he was there alone, standing on the cusp of an uprising. ``Don't do it, there'll be a bloodbath!'' cried an opposition leader over a loudspeaker. The people in the crowd on Thursday _ more than 200,000 angry opponents of Slobodan Milosevic _ weren't listening. They were watching the lone man in the track suit. He was waving them on. A few people stepped forward. Then more. Then a stampede that overwhelmed the line of police. With their votes, they had expressed their demand for change. Now, on a brisk afternoon, they were literally trampling Milosevic's 13 years of rule _ a period of war, corruption and despair that saw Yugoslavia ripped apart and reduced to a pariah, beggar nation. Soon the wide, granite steps of the parliament were clogged with protesters. They were at the front doors of the stately building, surrounding the bronze horse statues that watch over the main entrance. From inside, police launched another barrage of tear gas and stun grenades. But this time, there was no stopping the mob. They choked. Their eyes stung. But still they came. Even the weather helped them: A strong wind helped carry away the tear gas. Within minutes, the parliament _ a symbol of Milosevic's autocratic rule _ was set on fire and looted. The autocratic leader's dreaded policemen were in disarray. They fled or tossed away shields and batons to surrender to the demonstrators. ``He's finished!'' read a wrinkled opposition banner left dangling on the assembly's doors. ___ Milosevic had called Yugoslav presidential and parliamentary elections for Sept. 24, feeling it was his best bet to refresh his power before another harsh winter with no heating and a lack of staple goods. He also was counting on riding anti-Western sentiments stirred up by last year's 78-day NATO bombing. Milosevic and his neo-communist cronies were brimming with confidence. ``We'll beat them 100-0,'' predicted Ivan Markovic, one of Milosevic's closest allies. But by early September, Milosevic was trailing badly in the polls behind a stiff, unpolished law professor named Vojislav Kostunica. Milosevic dismissed the results as ``enemy'' propaganda financed by the West. But when his Socialist did their own poll, revealing an even worse shortfall for Milosevic, he threw a pollster out of his presidential office in the heavily protected Dedinje district. ``You are lying,'' he shouted, according to sources close to the former president. He ordered criminal charges to be filed against the opposition polling companies, saying they were misinforming the public. Milosevic was privately in panic by late September. He turned for help to his Marxist wife, Mirjana Markovic, using her for what she does best: launch merciless verbal attacks against perceived foes of Yugoslavia. Milosevic, too, hit the road. At one rally in Montenegro, Serbia's smaller partner in the two-republic Yugoslav federation, Milosevic lashed out at his opponents, calling them ``rats and hyenas.'' Serbian TV and the Politika daily newspaper _ his chief pillars of propaganda _ inflated the number of those who took part in poorly attended rallies. The Vecernje Novosti daily carried a front-page photo from the Montenegro rally, merging several pictures to make the crowd look huge. The trick was so obvious it was mocked in public. Milosevic's wife called the elections ``a matter of life and death.'' But according to party sources who spoke on condition of anonymity, she also tried to dispel fears among party officials, saying: ``The winner will be the one who counts the vote and not the one who wins.'' ___ On election night, Milosevic spokesman Nikola Sainovic was the messenger bearing bad news. He rushed to the president's White Palace in Dedinje to tell him that Kostunica appeared to be surging toward an outright victory. Milosevic reacted with fury, grabbing Sainovic by his mustache and telling him to go and reverse the results, Socialist party sources said. The Milosevic-controlled election commission is accused of shaving off just enough votes from Kostunica to justify calling a run-off. Kostunica refused the second round, saying new balloting would give the beleaguered Milosevic enough time to regroup, cheat even more and try to steal victory. With Milosevic unlikely to concede the clear defeat and step down, opposition leaders forged a plan that included widespread civil disobedience and possible use of force. Massive strikes and road blockades, unseen in Yugoslavia's 55-year history, spread throughout the country. On Oct. 2, in a last-ditch attempt to stem the tide, Milosevic used a televised address to plead with Serbs to rally behind him, saying the country would break apart and become a Western colony if he were not in charge. He later summoned his secret service chief, Rade Markovic, and another close ally, army chief of staff Gen. Nebojsa Pavkovic, for a crisis meeting. Milosevic urged them to prepare a crackdown against his opponents, a source at the meeting said. But they told him there was a simmering mutiny within the police and army and that officers were likely to switch sides in case of an intervention, sources said. ``Milosevic looked like he was going to die,'' one source said. ``And Mira (Markovic) went into hysterics. Doctors had to give her a tranquilizer injection.'' ___ In Cacak, an opposition stronghold in the industrial belt south of Belgrade, Mayor Velimir Ilic gathered a group of radicals including known local gangsters, karate experts and a few former policemen. They forged a plan to be put into effect in case Milosevic refused to step down by their deadline: 3 p.m. on Oct. 5. That morning, with Milosevic still clinging to power, they packed up a front-end loader and drove to Belgrade. During the 60-mile drive to the capital, the Cacak crowd swelled to more than 10,000. Nothing stood in their way. They people pushed aside four police roadblocks _ including one with trucks loaded with sand _ and marched to the front of the parliament building. ``Everything was planned,'' Ilic said. ``We said we won't return to Cacak until Milosevic was gone. And why hide it? Many of our men were armed and they knew exactly what they were doing.'' Ilic said the takeover plan included the onslaughts that eventually materialized at the parliament, the state broadcasting headquarters and the Politika newspaper. At the TV headquarters, a front-end loader plowed down the doors and the crowd streamed in. Several well-known reporters were severely beaten by the vengeful crowd as payback for years of feeding the public the warped Milosevic version of reality. At parliament, members of the crowd who surged past the police cordon took over the building. Fires broke out inside as protesters trashed offices, hurling pictures of Milosevic supporters out the windows. ___ Having been virtually deserted by top allies and fearing reprisals, Milosevic and his wife fled their usual residence and went into hiding in another house in Dedinje. On Friday, a day after the downtown rampage, Milosevic finally conceded the electoral defeat. The once-formidable Yugoslav president looked like a shadow of his former self. ``I intend to rest a bit and spend some more time with my family and especially with my grandson, Marko, and after that to help my party gain force and contribute to future prosperity,'' he said in a televised address. Many weren't ready to let it go at that. ``Milosevic and his wife should hang,'' exclaimed student Miroslav Jankovic during the carnival-like celebration, which stretched well into Friday before jubilation turned to happy exhaustion. ``Only then we'll be certain they won't torment us again.'' ___ EDITORS NOTE: Dusan Stojanovic has covered all four Balkan wars triggered by Milosevic and uprisings in neighboring Romania and Bulgaria.

Under the cover of rocket fire, Lebanese Hezbollah guerrillas seized three Israeli soldiers from a border patrol jeep Saturday and dedicated the ambush to a 12-year-old Gaza boy killed in fierce Israeli-Palestinian clashes that have left scores dead. Israel sent warnings to Lebanon and Syria _ the main power broker in Lebanon _ threatening fierce retaliation. Security officials said Israel would not hesitate to fight on two fronts, along the Lebanese border as well as in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. The escalation raised grave concerns about the fate of Mideast peacemaking, already rocked by Israeli-Palestinian clashes that have left 80 dead since Sept. 28. Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak convened military commanders and Cabinet ministers for an emergency session. In messages to the Syrian and Lebanese governments, Barak said Israel would take ``forceful action'' to ensure the safety of Israeli troops and communities along the border. After nightfall, Israeli transport helicopters airlifted forces to the northern border. Bomb shelters opened in border communities, but residents were not told to take cover. ``If we have to, we will fight on two fronts,'' said Deputy Defense Minister Ephraim Sneh. ``We have enough strength for that. We shall have to be less restrained than we were in the past.'' Barak has said he would do his utmost to resume negotiations with the Palestinians, but that he was no longer certain Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat was a partner for peace. Barak's officials echoed that concern Saturday after Palestinians trashed a holy site in the West Bank town of Nablus, tearing up Jewish holy books _ hours after Israeli troops withdrew from the tiny enclave before dawn and handed it over to control of Palestinian police. Communications Minister Binyamin Ben-Eliezer, who is close to Barak, said that he believed ``Arafat has abandoned the peace process, the path of diplomacy and has chosen the path of violence.'' Arafat said Saturday that Israel was to blame for a ``dangerous esclation against the Palestinian people, the Arab people, the Lebanese people and against Islamic and Christian holy places.'' Cabinet ministers urged Barak to form a national unity government that would include the hawkish opposition party Likud. Such a constellation would make it even more difficult to return to negotiations, since the Likud is staunchly opposed to making concessions to the Palestinians. Likud lawmakers accused Barak of showing weakness with his decision to vacate Joseph's Tomb, the Nablus holy site and the scene of bloody clashes over the past week. The move represented the first time Israel has given up a position in response to Palestinian violence. Developments in the north, meanwhile, ended the relative peace enjoyed at the Israeli-Lebanese border since Barak decided to withdraw Israeli troops from southern Lebanon in May. Earlier Saturday, hundreds of Palestinian refugees charged toward the border fence from the Lebanese side, hurling stones at Israeli soldiers. Troops opened fire, killing one Palestinian and wounding 14. The three soldiers were captured in what appeared to be a carefully planned Hezbollah ambush soon afterward. Israel TV's Channel Two said guerrillas fired rockets toward the Har Dov outpost in northern Israel. When Israeli troops arrived at the scene in an open truck, with machine guns mounted on either end, guerrillas fired more rockets, cut through the fence and snatched three soldiers. The captives were driven away in a civilian car, the TV report said. Israeli helicopters later searched the area, located near the disputed Chebaa farms region. Helicopter gunships lay down machine-gun fire on roads, injuring a family of four, Lebanese security officials said. Hezbollah said in a statement that it dedicated the raid to 12-year-old Mohammed Aldura, a Palestinian boy killed by Israeli fire during a gunbattle in the Gaza Strip last week. The boy's terrifying last moments, as he and his father huddled behind a metal barrel, were broadcast around the world. Israeli government spokesman Nahman Shai said Israel was using diplomatic channels to try to get the soldiers back, and was in touch with U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan. U.N. peacekeepers are deployed in southern Lebanon. In the West Bank and Gaza Strip, the level of violence dropped significantly Saturday. One Palestinian was killed in clashes in Gaza, and two died of injuries sustained Friday. The vast majority of the 80 dead and more than 1,900 injured were Palestinians. The violence was triggered by a Sept. 28 visit of Israeli opposition leader Ariel Sharon to a contested holy shrine in Jerusalem. A sovereignty dispute over the shrine, known to Jews as the Temple Mount and to Muslims as the Haram as-Sharif, or Noble Sanctuary, led to a breakdown in Israeli-Palestinian peace talks in July. On Saturday, in an attempt to reduce friction, Israel withdrew its troops from Joseph's Tomb, an embattled shrine-turned-bunker in the West Bank town of Nablus. Palestinian police had assured Israel that they would guard the compound, which was home to a Jewish seminary. However, just hours after the Israeli pullout, during which an Israeli border policeman was injured by shooting, hundreds of Palestinian civilians stormed the site. Jubilant Palestinians climbed to the domed roof of the tomb area, raised a Palestinian flag and posed for photographers with a framed Arafat poster. Others ripped up several Jewish prayer books that had been left behind and set fire to areas of the compound. The tomb had been the scene of daily firefights for a week, and one Israeli border policeman and six Palestinians were killed there. Opposition leaders accused Barak of having capitulated to Palestinian violence. Palestinian officials demanded that Israel dismantle other small outposts and isolated Jewish settlements to reduce friction further. In the Gaza Strip, meanwhile, Nafez Azzam, a spokesman of the militant group Islamic Jihad, thanked Hezbollah for the capture of the Israeli soldiers. ``This will give us a push to continue our struggle against the occupiers,'' Azzam told Associated Press Television News. ``What happened today at Joseph's Tomb and what happened in Lebanon proves that fighting is the only solution with them.''

After days of uncertainty over whether Slobodan Milosevic would cede power, Yugoslavia's new democratic administration was delayed again Saturday by wrangling between Vojislav Kostunica's coalition and the former ruling party. With the army behind him and Milosevic grudgingly wishing him well, Kostunica was scheduled to take his presidential oath Saturday and begin leading Yugoslavia away from isolation and sanctions. But delaying tactics by Milosevic allies underlined the fact that Kostunica still has some way to go to turn the top echelons from bastions of Milosevic loyalists into officials committed to government by democracy. The swearing-in was scheduled to take place in Belgrade's modernistic Sava Center, after the parliament building was gutted and ransacked in protests Thursday that toppled Milosevic. In a sign of conflict ahead, the ceremony was delayed in part by Milosevic's Socialists and an allied party, together the second-strongest bloc in parliament. They contested parts of the Sept. 24 vote that led to Kostunica's victory, and their debates lengthened the first session of the new Yugoslav parliament. ``They're already creating a serious problem,'' said Milan Protic, Belgrade's mayor and a leading opposition figure. ``We did not expect them to react like this.'' Perhaps mindful of the potential for trouble ahead, Kostunica was low-key in comments about Milosevic and his future. ``For now, it is more than enough that Milosevic congratulated me,'' Kostunica said. ``Difficult times are behind us, but the days ahead also hold many trials.'' At the inaugural session of parliament were Serbian President Milan Milutinovic and other key Milosevic allies, including Serbia's interior minister and other top officials. Serbia and the smaller, Western-oriented Montenegro make up Yugoslavia. Milutinovic, like Milosevic, is sought by the U.N. war crimes tribunal. As Serbian president he has sweeping powers, including direct control over the state's 100,000-strong police force. Those powers are much more substantial than those of the federal president, even though Milosevic beefed up the post's stature. Vlajko Stojiljkovic, Serbia's interior minister, struck a defiant tone before the start of the parliament meeting, describing the events that led to Milosevic's ouster as ``the work of hooligans.'' Another key Milosevic supporter, Ljubica Ristic, described the unrest as part of a ``coup'' against Milosevic. Milosevic addressed the Yugoslav people in a televised speech late Friday, conceding he had lost the presidential elections. Hours afterward, the army's chief of staff, Gen. Nebojsa Pavkovic, congratulated Kostunica and indicated the military would obey the new political authority. Yugoslavia's high court had also named Kostunica the election winner and powerful Yugoslav ally Russia offered its support. In his speech, Milosevic said he wanted to take a break before restarting an active political life. As an indicted war criminal, he has little chance of seeking asylum abroad and has no choice but to try to reach an accommodation with the new government. His concession prompted bursts of gunfire and wild honking of car horns in the streets of Belgrade, where tens of thousands kept up celebrations that began Thursday in the wake of a tumultuous uprising against 13 years of Milosevic's autocratic rule. Also confirming Kostunica's position, the speaker of the Serbian parliament, Dragan Tomic, addressed Kostunica as president in a letter Friday _ the first such recognition by a high official from Milosevic's Socialist Party of Serbia. Another anti-Milosevic leader, Zoran Djindjic, said Saturday that Milosevic no longer had any control over the police or army troops. ``We can breathe a sigh or relief now,'' Djindjic told independent B2-92 radio, adding that his camp had been contacted by top ranks and brigade officials to that effect. Milosevic is blamed by the West for starting _ and then losing _ four Balkan wars that broke out in the last decade when parts of Yugoslavia began to seek independence. Those conflicts were marked by horrific acts of violence against civilians, which prompted Western governments to impose sanctions and isolate Belgrade. Some of those controls were eased after Milosevic signed the 1995 agreement to end the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina. However, other sanctions were imposed again in 1998 after Milosevic launched a brutal crackdown on ethnic Albanians in Kosovo. In the past days, both the United States and the European Union have said they will begin to lift sanctions as the new democratic administration takes the reins.

Vice President Al Gore, responding to intensifying Republican attacks on his credibility, said Saturday that he did not have a problem with embellishment that should cause concern about his character, and he accused Gov. George W. Bush of waging personal attacks rather than focusing on issues. In a 30-minute conference call with reporters, which was intended to highlight education issues that he will emphasize next week, Gore answered several questions about what Republicans are portraying as a pattern of exaggeration about often incidental matters. On Friday, Bush's running mate, Dick Cheney, said Gore ``seems to have a compulsion to embellish,'' and Republican strategists have made it clear that they will continue to press the issue. Gore acknowledged Saturday that he has made occasional factual mistakes, as when he said in Tuesday's debate that he had accompanied James Lee Witt, the director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, to inspect fire and flooding damage in Texas in 1998. Gore did visit Texas, but with one of Witt's deputies, not with Witt. Gore has said that he made the mistake because he has frequently made trips of that sort with Witt. In response to questions, Gore said that he did not have a tendency to embellish his resume, and that his misstatements did not point to a deeper character flaw. He then tried to turn the tables, asserting that he does not make personal attacks against Bush when the governor misstates the facts. He went on to describe two such comments. Gore said it ``could be characterized as an exaggeration'' when Bush said in the debate that the Gore campaign was outspending the Bush campaign. ``But,'' Gore said, ``I didn't seize on that as anything other than a mistake that he made. When he said that there were 20,000 new bureaucrats called for in my budget plan, similarly I don't describe that as fictitious or an exaggeration. It's just a mistake on his part.'' Even as he pointed out Bush's ``mistakes,'' Gore said he was not denigrating his rival's character. ``These are negative personal attacks of the kind I simply do not engage in,'' Gore said. ``The Republican ticket announced a few weeks ago that they were going to adopt a new strategy of focusing on the issues, but they have completely abandoned that strategy, and they are focused almost entirely on personal attacks.'' Gore said his stood by his decision in the debate to illustrate the problem of school crowding by speaking of a 15-year-old girl in Sarasota, Fla., who had to stand in class. In fact, school officials have said, the girl was without a desk for only one day. ``They tried to make that out to be an exaggeration,'' Gore said of the Republicans. ``Well, excuse me, her father wrote me a handwritten letter, enclosing a picture on the front page of The Sarasota Herald Tribune of his daughter standing in class on the ninth day of school.'' If the girl later received a desk, he said, ``that doesn't change the fact that there are 36 students in a classroom designed for 24.'' He also stood by his rebuff of Bush's suggestion that Russia should have tried to use its influence to persuade Slobodan Milosevic to leave office in Yugoslavia. Gore said that he was ``not sure it's right for us to invite the president of Russia to mediate this dispute there because we might not like the result.'' In fact, the White House had been doing just that, with President Clinton and American diplomats speaking to their Russian counterparts to solicit their support for democratic change in Yugoslavia. ``I stand by exactly what I said,'' Gore said Saturday, ``that the instinct to involve them is not wrong, but we did not want to invite them to be the mediator if they did not agree to the right outcome.'' He added: ``It appears that they negotiated an arrangement to keep Milosevic in some form of political power as an opposition leader with his hand still in the affairs of Serbia. That is distinctly contrary to what we would like to see happen.'' Gore will leave on Sunday for Sarasota, Fla., where he planned to prepare for Wednesday's debate in Winston-Salem, N.C.

Briskly adapting to the fall of Slobodan Milosevic, who was a close diplomatic ally, President Jiang Zemin Saturday sent ``heartfelt congratulations'' to the newly elected president of Yugoslavia. In his message to Vojislav Kostunica, whose election was certified this week only after a popular uprising forced Milosevic to relinquish power, Jiang wished the new president ``a smooth job in his new lofty position and remarkable achievements in his endeavors towards the stability and prosperity of Yugoslavia,'' according to a report by the New China News Agency. China was one of Milosevic's staunchest supporters during last year's NATO campaign against Yugoslavia over Kosovo, where Milosevic's security forces were killing and repressing the majority Albanian population. China's vehement opposition to the NATO military action _ portrayed here as an imperialistic expansion of American ``hegemony'' using human rights as a pretext _ arose in part from China's own fear that foreign powers might some day support ethnic insurrections in Tibet or in the Muslim region of Xinjiang. Throughout the Kosovo bombing campaign, China's official media virtually ignored reports of ``ethnic cleansing'' and other Serbian atrocities in Kosovo and described Milosevic and his government as heroic defenders of the sacred principle of national sovereignty. The criticism of the NATO bomb- ing campaign grew much more shrill after U.S. planes bombed the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade in May 1999. Washington apologized, saying L that the bombing was an error, but the bombing caused a deterioration in Chinese-American relations and prompted massive demonstrations outside the U.S. Embassy in Beijing. When the International Tribunal in the Hague indicted Milosevic last year for alleged war crimes in Kosovo connected with ethnic cleans- ing by his security forces, the Chi- nese government described the in- dictment as an U.S.-led ``politi- cal scheme.'' In June this year, China's parliament leader, Li Peng, visited Belgrade for three days, where Milosevic presented him with Yugoslavia's highest medal, the Great Star. Milosevic, and particularly his Marxist wife, Mirjana Markovic, have long viewed Beijing and its Communist party as powerful L friends and the sort of ideological comrades they lacked in eastern Eu- rope after the Communist regimes of the Soviet bloc fell in quick succes- sion in 1989. But in the aftermath of the Kosovo war, Milosevic's international indictment and the rise of his domestic opponents, Li and other Chinese officials have generally stressed the common interests linking China and Yugoslavia rather than singling out Milosevic for praise. Saturday, a foreign ministry spokesman, Sun Yuxi, said that ``China respects the choice of the Yugoslavian people,'' adding that ``we believe that the change of situation in Yugoslavia will not affect the healthy development of China-Yugoslavia relations.'' The political turn in Belgrade has caused lively traffic on China's Internet bulletin boards, which last year were filled with anti-American venom. This time, many anonymous writers have made pointed comments about the success of democracy in Yugoslavia, with one saying, for example, ``Yugoslavs win democracy, how about us?'' and another saying, ``Milosevic's fall is making some people here nervous.''

Prime Minister Ehud Barak issued a 48-hour ultimatum to Yasser Arafat on Saturday, saying that that unless the Palestinian leader stops violence in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, Israel will call off peace talks and let Israeli troops act with full force. The strong statement from the embattled prime minister came after Hezbollah guerrillas seized three Israeli soldiers in an ambush Saturday at the Israeli-Lebanese border. Arafat's top adviser, Nabil Aburdeneh, accused Barak of employing ``blackmail that can only lead the region to wars we don't want,'' but did not say what the Palestinians' next move would be. Barak vowed to win the soldiers' return, warning Lebanon and Syria _ the main power broker in the country _ that they were responsible for the captives' safety. At the same time, his deputy defense minister Ephraim Sneh said Israel was ready to ``fight on two fronts'' _ the Lebanese border as well as in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. ``We have enough strength for that. We shall have to be less restrained than we were in the past,'' Sneh said. Barak said he was no longer convinced Arafat was ready for a peace agreement, blaming Arafat for the clashes between Israeli soldiers and Palestinian protesters that have killed 80 _ most Palestinians. Arafat ``has apparently chosen violence and he will bear the responsibility for the consequences of that choice,'' Barak said ``Until now, my orders were to exercise restraint, not to initiate, but just to react,'' Barak told a news conference after convening his Cabinet and army commanders for an emergency session. ``If we do not see a change in the patterns of violence in the next two days, we will see this as the cessation of the peace talks by Arafat,'' he said, ``and will instruct the Israeli Defense Forces and the security forces to use all means at their disposal to stop the violence.'' An Israeli government statement warned of ``forceful action'' to ensure the safety of Israeli troops and communities along the border. Barak has come under growing pressure to take tougher steps. Members of his Cabinet urged him Saturday to form a national unity government with the hawkish opposition Likud party. That would make resuming negotiations with the Palestinians difficult, since Likud is vehemently opposed to concessions. Barak's announcement came as violence sharply declined in the Palestinian territories Saturday _ but it followed the trashing Saturday morning of Joseph's Tomb, a holy site in the West Bank town of Nablus, by Palestinians. Barak ordered Israeli troops withdrawn from the site, putting it in control of Palestinian security forces. Within hours, a mob overwhelmed the site, burning parts and tearing up Jewish holy books left by seminary students. The scenes, broadcast on television, were considered a humiliation by many Israelis. Until now, the army has used assault rifles, snipers and rockets launched from helicopters to disperse Palestinian gunmen. Israel has trained tank guns on Palestinian towns as a warning, but has not fired. A combative Arafat, speaking before Barak set his deadline, blamed Israel for what he said was a ``dangerous escalation'' in the Palestinian areas and the Arab world. Developments in the north, meanwhile, ended the relative peace enjoyed at the Israeli-Lebanese border since Barak decided to withdraw Israeli troops from southern Lebanon in May. Earlier Saturday, hundreds of Palestinian refugees charged toward the border fence from the Lebanese side, hurling stones at Israeli soldiers. Troops opened fire, killing one Palestinian and wounding 14. Barak said he was holding intense diplomatic contacts to try to win the freedom of the three Israeli soldiers. He said he has spoken three times by phone to President Clinton over the last 24 hours and has also been in touch with U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan. After nightfall, Israeli transport helicopters airlifted forces to the northern border. The three soldiers were captured in what appeared to be a carefully planned Hezbollah ambush soon afterward. Israel TV's Channel Two said guerrillas fired rockets at an Israeli post in the disputed Chebaa farms border region, claimed by both Lebanon and Israel. When Israeli troops arrived at the scene in an open truck, guerrillas fired more rockets, cut through the fence and snatched three soldiers. The captives were driven away in a civilian car, the TV report said. Israeli helicopters later searched the area, while Helicopter gunships lay down machine-gun fire on roads, injuring a family of four, Lebanese security officials said. Hezbollah said in a statement that it dedicated the raid to 12-year-old Mohammed Aldura, a Palestinian boy killed by Israeli fire during a gunbattle in the Gaza Strip last week. The boy's terrifying last moments, as he and his father huddled behind a metal barrel, were broadcast around the world. Meanwhile, one Palestinian was killed in clashes in Gaza, and two died of injuries sustained Friday. Later Saturday, Palestinian gunmen opened fire on several Israeli outposts and Jewish settlements in the West Bank. Still, it was the quietest day since the violence was triggered by a Sept. 28 visit of Israeli opposition leader Ariel Sharon to a contested holy shrine in Jerusalem. A sovereignty dispute over the shrine, known to Jews as the Temple Mount and to Muslims as the Haram as-Sharif, or Noble Sanctuary, led to a breakdown in Israeli-Palestinian peace talks in July. Israel's withdrawal from Joseph's Tomb came in an attempt to reduce friction at the site, where an Israeli border policeman and six Palestinians have been killed in daily firefights over the past week. The army said it had assurances by Palestinian security force that they would protect the tomb, But within hours, hundreds of Palestinian civilians stormed the site. Palestinian officials demanded that Israel dismantle other small outposts and isolated Jewish settlements to reduce friction further. In the Gaza Strip, meanwhile, Nafez Azzam, a spokesman of the militant group Islamic Jihad, thanked Hezbollah for the capture of the Israeli soldiers. ``This will give us a push to continue our struggle against the occupiers,'' Azzam told Associated Press Television News. ``What happened today at Joseph's Tomb and what happened in Lebanon proves that fighting is the only solution with them.''

Slobodan Milosevic's plans to remain active in politics could spell trouble for Yugoslavia's newly elected president and the victorious pro-democracy coalition. The disgraced autocrat's Socialist Party and its neo-communist allies appeared to be on the verge of collapse after massive and violent protests led them to acknowledge victory by opposition challenger Vojislav Kostunica in last month's presidential vote. Party activities have been suspended since Thursday, when pro-democracy demonstrators stormed federal parliament, the state television building and other centers of Milosevic's power. Milosevic, who has been indicted by the international war crimes tribunal in The Hague, Netherlands, cannot leave Yugoslavia without risking arrest and extradition. Kostunica has pledged not to extradite him. But Milosevic appears to retain enough residual power to block Kostunica's reforms and _ through proxies who still control Serbia's police _ Yugoslavia's reintegration into the world. ``I think he is preparing positions for a stab in the back by consolidating the police (and) creating chaos,'' Zoran Djindjic, head of the Democratic Party, told The Associated Press. After initial speculation that he was hiding out, a visibly shaken Milosevic appeared on TV late Friday to concede defeat and congratulate Kostunica on his victory. ``I intend to rest a little and spend some more time with my family and especially with my grandson, Marko, and after that to help my party gain force and contribute to future prosperity,'' he said. Other deposed leaders have managed to stay home and stay alive. But in countries like Chile and Indonesia, the old autocrats have been troublesome to new democratic regimes, sabotaging their efforts to overcome the legacy of authoritarian rule. Despite massive defeats in the presidential ballot and local council elections, the Socialists still have a majority in the state legislature of Serbia, Yugoslavia's dominant republic, where they are allied with the ultranationalist Radical Party. The president of Serbia, Milan Milutinovic, is one of Milosevic's closest cronies. He is also an indicted war criminal, and his fate depends on Milosevic's own political survival. The Serbian presidency has sweeping powers, including direct control over the state's 100,000-strong police force. Its powers are much more substantial than those of the federal president, even though Milosevic beefed up the post's stature under his tenure. ``Milutinovic occupies a very strong post and he will remain unswervingly loyal to Milosevic,'' said Braca Grubacic, a Belgrade political analyst. ``This presents Milosevic with unlimited possibilities to block any reforms initiated by Kostunica.'' Even on the federal level, Milosevic retains significant clout. His leftist coalition controls 46 of 178 seats in the federal parliament. Together with an allied party from Montenegro, Yugoslavia's smaller republic, his allies could conceivably form the new federal government, sidelining Kostunica. Ultimately, however, Milosevic's ability to play any political role will depend on his ability to rally his badly shaken party. Stunned by the extent of their electoral defeat, members were reported to be deserting in droves. Some opposition leaders are convinced Milosevic's power will ebb quickly, now that he has lost control of the government media he used as his propaganda mouthpiece during 13 years of iron-fisted rule. Milosevic also remains vulnerable to criminal prosecution for running one of Europe's most corrupt regimes. Some have accused him of orchestrating a spate of assassinations in which some of the country's most senior politicians and underworld figures have died. ``In the end, Milosevic may even prefer extradition to The Hague rather than stay here and face our justice,'' said opposition leader Zarko Korac.

finally tonight, science fiction evolving into science fact. every day an estimated 100 living species disappear but a genetic breakthrough announced today may help change that, at least when it comes to animals. abc's bill redeker reports on an iowa cow's unprecedented blessed event. the genetic breakthrough is based on research using bessie, a pregnant cow. but bessie is not having a cow. she's expected to deliver an asian guar, an endangered ox-like animal native to india and burma. we have successfully cloned the world's first endangered species using a new technology that most scientists thought was impossible. bessie's guar, named noah, was cloned by taking an egg from a cow, removing its genetic material, and replacing it with a single skin cell taken from a dead guar, creating an embryo identical to the donor guar. most remarkably, this shows that we are able to use cloning by taking tissues from different animal species to help us produce animals we like. animals such as the giant panda. hsing-hsing and ling-ling were notoriously shy lovers when they were alive and never produced offspring that survived more than a few days. now, scientists using tissue from the dead pandas hope to do better. we would like to clone hsing-hsing and ling-ling, whose cells have been frozen away here in the united states, and we would like to use the america black bear as the source of the eggs and as the surrogate mom. not everyone is so excited about cloning these animals. some worry that the new technology could produce herds of animals that lack genetic diversity, which is crucially important to their survival. others fear that if extinct animals are brought back and their original habitat is gone, they will only be able to survive in zoos. m i think that's playing god, because we haven't thought about what it really takes to really be successful in keeping these animals around. but we've got all the ego in the world to try. the movie "jurassic park" was based on the notion that dinosaurs, extinct for millions of years, could be cloned and brought back to earth. but fear not, scientists say it is impossible to clone fossilized species. you can't clone from stone. you need living tissue. besides, i don't know what a surrogate mom would be for such an animal. so, even in the brave new world of genetics, some species will remain in museums and movies -- at least for now. bill redeker, abc news, new york. the scientists will also soon attempt to resurrect an extinct species for the first time ever by clone ago species of mountain goat that died out months ago. find out more on our website at abcnews.com. that's our report.

yugoslavia, fresh from its sudden successful democratic revolution, now turns to a new task -- rebuilding a nation devastated by war and economic ruin. nbc's jim maceda. the first day on the job for vojislav kostunica -- the new president of yugoslavia meeting with the army's top brass, who until thursday's popular uprising were loyal to ousted leader slobodan milosevic. the army now says it will obey kostunica's authority. this is a new era in our political life and in our life in general. serbs awoke to the news and the hope of a fresh start, but in downtown belgrade, not much felt new for dragisha and his family, who wait on line every sunday for at least five hours to fill their gas tank. "we've heard that economic sanctions will be lifted," he says. "and we hope that gasoline will be plentiful again." sanctions may be lifted as early as tomorrow, after a decade of crippling the country. hundreds of factories -- derelict under communism or destroyed by nato bombs, some $4 billion in damage. real unemployment is close to 50%. those who have jobs saw their salaries whither away under milosevic's rule. "ten years ago," says this worker, "i earned $1,000 a month. today, i make 10 to 15 times less, and i'm better off than most." the new government, when it is formed, could have a short-lived honeymoon if serbs don't see very quickly how voting for democracy can be translated into concrete improvements in their lives. today, the first encouraging news, norway's foreign minister pledging $20 million in aid, but economists say at least $500 million is needed for a quick fix -- improving an outmoded power grid, stocking stores with more basic commodities and salvaging an impoverished welfare system. what is kostunica's biggest problem? everything. everything. even optimists think it will take ten years to catch up with the rest of eastern europe, but today in churches throughout serbia, newlyweds believe their future is a lot brighter. jim maceda, nbc news, belgrade.

The first conversation Vojislav Kostunica ever had with Slobodan Milosevic was on Friday night, when Milosevic, faced with a popular revolt, finally conceded defeat in the Yugoslav presidential elections and agreed to go on television to say so. Kostunica, 56, a constitutional lawyer born into a legal family with a tradition of opposing the communists, had always kept his distance from Milosevic. That was a sharp contrast to more prominent opposition leaders, like Zoran Djindjic and Vuk Draskovic, who had negotiated with him or even joined his ruling coalition. It was Kostunica's image as the anti-Milosevic _ his apparently uncorrupted, humble, unpretentious and somehow normal air _ that made him a perfect candidate for these elections, which became a referendum on Milosevic himself. Kostunica, who has a deep sense of Serbian history and nationalism and is an outspoken critic of NATO's bombing war against Yugoslavia over Kosovo, could not be accused of ``collaboration'' with NATO and the West. He was a bridge over which many Milosevic supporters could walk into opposition. But when the opposition _ a loose coalition of 18 parties, including his own _ asked him to be their candidate, it took Kostunica a long time to decide to run, he said. He kept wondering why some opposition leaders, who had never disguised their mistrust of his nationalism, wanted him as their candidate. His devotion to principle was often seen by others, not always incorrectly, as a form of political inactivity and obstinacy. One leader said: ``He always knew what was wrong with everyone's ideas. He knew what he didn't want, but not what he did.'' He described his own indecision about running this way: ``It was a joke that among the undecided voters in Belgrade was Vojislav Kostunica.'' But opinion polling showed him as the opposition's best candidate _ with the most positives and, most important, the fewest negatives. Kostunica soon understood that the task was both important and inescapable, he said. Overcoming what he describes as his innate skepticism and pessimism, he began a campaign of retail politics, driving all over Yugoslavia to shake hands, hold rallies and appear on local news programs, that inspired him to real optimism. When he won the election outright in the first round, but was denied his victory through vote fraud, he refused any effort by Milosevic to compromise. Vojislav Kostunica was born in Belgrade on March 24, 1944. He graduated from Belgrade University Law School in 1966, earning a master's degree in 1970 with a thesis on ``The political theory and practice of the constitutional judiciary in Yugoslavia.'' In 1974, however, he was fired from his job as a lecturer at the law school for defending a senior professor's criticism of changes to the constitution made that year by Tito. In 1989, when Yugoslavia's new leader, Milosevic, tried to co-opt intellectuals and offered to rehire those fired in 1974, only Kostunica refused. Moving to an academic institute, Kostunica received a doctorate in 1976 with a thesis on ``Institutionalized Opposition in Capitalist Political Systems,'' which formed the basis for a book. Despite his criticism of U.S. foreign policy, he describes himself as a Western liberal, with a belief in free speech, an independent media and judiciary, and the rule of law. He translated the Federalist Papers into Serbo-Croatian in 1981, and was a member of a committee to defend freedom of speech in the early 1980s, when the post-Tito regime cracked down on advocates of nationalism ranging from Franjo Tudjman in Croatia and Vojislav Seselj in Serbia to Alija Izetbegovic in Bosnia and Adem Demaci in Kosovo. Two of those men _ Tudjman and Izetbegovic _ went on to become presidents of their republics, just as Kostunica has now of his. With Djindjic, he helped found the Democratic Party in 1989, but left when it split in 1992 to found his own Democratic Party of Serbia. He and the party believed that the Serbian national question was central, and he supported the efforts of Radovan Karadzic for self-determination by the Serbs in Bosnia. Kostunica condemned ethnic cleansing and did not lend any support to paramilitaries. But he has criticized the war-crimes tribunal in The Hague, Netherlands, as a political instrument of U.S. policy, not an independent legal institution. And he says he will not arrest Milosevic or hand him over to the tribunal for trial on charges stemming from the Kosovo war. Karadzic and the Bosnian Serb Gen. Ratko Mladic, who has been living in Belgrade, were both indicted for war crimes in Bosnia. Kostunica has refused to say whether he would extradite them, saying that he has higher priorities now and that extradition is not within the scope of the Yugoslav president. Another complication is that both men are citizens of Bosnia, not Yugoslavia. In Kostunica's refusal to answer is a clear reluctance, but also an understanding that turning the two men over to the tribunal might be part of the price for the reintegration into Europe that Yugoslavia craves. Kostunica speaks English, German and French. He and his wife, Zorica Radovic, also a lawyer, have no children. They live with a dog and two cats in a small apartment in the Dorcol section of Belgrade. However impractically, he says he wants to remain there even as president, choosing not to occupy the official residences used by Tito and Milosevic.

A popular uprising helped bring him to the Yugoslav presidency just a few days ago, but now Vojislav Kostunica faces the daunting challenge of solidifying power and ending the country's economic isolation. VOA correspondent Eve Cornard in Belgrade reports the European Union is expected to announce later today an easing of sanctions against Yugoslavia, now the former leader Slobodan Milosevic is out of office. Yugoslavia is awaiting word that sanctions that have strangled its economy might be partially lifted. European Union officials say a further lifting of sanctions is likely once Mr. Kostunica has a firm grip on power. But ousted leader Slobodan Milosevic says he plans to remain in Belgrade as a leader of the opposition to Mr. Kostunica, who says he has no plans to bow to Western pressure to extradite the former Yugoslav leader. Another test of Mr. Kostunica's political clout will be the meeting of Serbia's powerful Parliament on Monday, where supporters of Mr. Kostunica are expected to push for new election. The process of purging Milosevic supporters from key institutions and industries is underway. Kostunica supporters say the most important task now is to gain full control over Yugoslavia's police and security services, removing any trace of pro-Milosevic officials within the higher ranks, who could still be manipulated by him.

This year's Nobel Prize selections begin with the award for medicine, which was bumped to the top slot after the academy failed to reach a decision last week on the literature price _ usually the first announced. The awards start Monday and culminate Friday with the coveted peace prize in Oslo, Norway. The award for physiology or medicine is worth $915,000 this year. The winners of the prizes for physics and chemistry will be announced Tuesday and for economics _ the only one not established in Nobel's will _ on Wednesday in Stockholm. The Swedish Academy, which traditionally keeps the date of the literature prize secret until a couple days before it announces the winner, has not set a time yet, but it is always a Thursday, usually in October. The suspense for the literature award was heightened last week when the academy failed to reach a decision. ``Sometimes they come to a decision very quickly,'' Svante Fregert, an editor at the daily newspaper Svenska Dagbladet said. ``But they probably have two or three names and if the vote is even, then they have to do it again.'' Alfred Nobel, the Swedish industrialist and inventor of dynamite, left only vague guidelines in his will establishing the prizes. The selection committees deliberate in strict secrecy. The only public hints available are for the peace prize. The five-member awards committee never reveals the candidates, but sometimes those making the nominations announce their favorites. This year that includes President Clinton and former President Jimmy Carter for wide-ranging peace efforts, as well as former U.S. Sen. George Mitchell for his efforts to resolve conflict in Northern Ireland. Other reported nominees are former Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari and former Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin for their Balkan peace efforts; South Korean President Kim Dae-jung for promoting good relations in Asia; and a town, northern Albania's Kukes, for accepting 150,000 refugees during the Kosovo conflict. The literature and peace laureates are usually the most visible, but the new adjectives ``Nobel winner'' often also bring scientists more attention from outside their laboratories. As for the first announcement, Nobel's direction that a prize be awarded to the person who made ``the most important discovery within the domain of physiology or medicine'' is interpreted by a committee of 50 professors from the world-renowned Karolinska Institute in the Swedish capital. The Nobel Assembly at Karolinska invites nominations from previous recipients, professors of medicine and other professionals worldwide before whittling down its choices in the fall, as do the other selection committees. Last year's winner was Dr. Guenter Blobel, 64, a German native and U.S. citizen who discovered how proteins find their rightful places in cells _ a process that goes awry in diseases like cystic fibrosis and plays a key role in the manufacture of some medicines. The awards always are presented Dec. 10, the anniversary of Nobel's death in 1896. ___ On the Net: http://www.nobel.se

The government of Serbia, the largest republic of Yugoslavia and a bastion of power for former strongman Slobodan Milosevic, resigned Monday, paving the way for new elections. The resignation came as Yugoslav Prime Minister Momir Bulatovic, a Milosevic ally, also stepped down, Tanjug news agency said. The moves constitute a sharp blow to Milosevic's efforts to keep a foothold in Yugoslavia's institutions. The top leaders in the Serbian government were close Milosevic allies. Serbia is Yugoslavia's largest republic, accounting for 90 percent of Yugoslavia's population of 10 million. Pro-democracy leader Zoran Djindjic said that new elections for the Serbian legislature, which is separate from the Yugoslav parliament, will be held on Dec. 19. Serbian lawmakers will formally announce the decision about the government and the election date at a session later Monday, Djindjic said. ``We have achieved an important step in trying to create a transitional government, to create condition for free and fair elections,'' Djindjic said. If the Serbian government were allowed to remain in place, it would have been in position to block many reforms the new government of Yugoslav President Vojislav Kostunica wants to implement. Given the current popular wave of support for the new president, Kostunica is likely to win a strong majority in the republic's new parliament. Serbia's president and parliament are elected separately from federal posts and were not involved in the contentious federal vote Sept. 24. Serbian President Milan Milutinovic and other Serbian government leaders were elected in 1998 to four-year terms. Djindjic said that a transitional government consisting of economic experts and party leaders will be formed to replace the existing Serbian administration, which is headed by Milosevic's staunch ally, Mirko Marjanovic. Kostunica's allies have insisted that the pro-Milosevic authorities in Serbia had lost all legitimacy after a massive triumph by pro-democracy forces in elections last month. Meanwhile, Yugoslavia's defense minister attempted Monday to rally opponents of the new government, issuing a last-ditch appeal to Milosevic's shaken supporters not to abandon the ousted leader. Gen. Dragoljub Ojdanic said that the disunity among the Serbs is inciting the plans of our proven (foreign) enemies'' to occupy the country. Milosevic's allies have consistently referred to Kostunica and his followers as Western lackeys bent on taking over the Serb state. ``If we continue like this, we won't get far ... how can we save the people of Serbia, how can we prevent our extinction,'' Ojdanic said, indicating that if the pro-democracy forces prevail in the country, the Serbs would ``disappear.'' Ojdanic, a close Milosevic ally who has also been indicted for war crimes, has not formally recognized Kostunica as the new Yugoslav president and is not expected to keep his position in the new government. He has no direct control of the military, which has fallen under Kostunica's command. Still, he retains influence among the military brass, and any call he might make to rally pro-Milosevic forces could be problematic for the new regime. ``Is the struggle for power more important that the fate of the nation?'' Ojdanic said in a statement. The military leadership _ which consist mostly of Milosevic loyalists _ has only grudgingly endorsed Kostunica as the new head of state. The top generals will likely be all replaced as part of a sweeping purge of Milosevic's supporters which many pro-democracy activists and the pro-Western leadership of Montenegro _ Yugoslavia's other republic _ have long been demanding. Yugoslavia was calm Monday, and there were no apparent signs of any trouble. On Sunday, Montenegro's pro-Western President Milo Djukanovic and Djindjic agreed to fire all of the top army generals, including Ojdanic. Kostunica, Djukanovic and the Serbian president comprise the Supreme Defense Council, which will decide on the changes in the next few days, the Montenegrin Vijesti daily said. Although Kostunica was sworn in as Yugoslav president on Saturday, numerous hurdles still stand in his way before he can push through democratic reforms after 13 years of autocratic rule by Milosevic. That rule ended after a popular uprising last week forced Milosevic to accept defeat in Sept. 24 presidential elections. Meanwhile, a mob of angry workers attacked Radoman Bozovic, a close Milosevic aide and the director of a major trading corporation. He tried to flee from his car, but he was caught and beaten. His bodyguards snatched him into a nearby building for safety. Later, Bozovic resigned as the head of the export-import company. In the third largest Serbian city of Nis, workers stormed a state-run textile factory Nitex, demanding the Socialist management be fired. Vladimir Stambuk, a neo-communist official and dean of the School of Political Sciences at Belgrade University was fired Monday. Meanwhile in Luxembourg, the European Union foreign ministers debated lifting some economic sanctions against Yugoslavia on Monday, a step toward rebuilding the war-torn country after Kostunica became its new president.

finally tonight in, case you heard about it and missed it, "saturday night live's" version of the bush-gore debate including dead-on parodies of both candidates. their season started this weekend. the tradition that started with achieve chase as gerry ford dan aykroyd as jimmy carter is alive and well. we begin with a fake jim lehrer. mr. vice president, during this campaign you have frequently called the bush tax plan a risky scheme. why? well, jim, governor bush and i have two very different plans to offer tax relief to american families. in his plan, the wealthiest 1% of americans would receive nearly 50% of the benefits. my plan, jim, is different. rather than squander the surplus on a risky tax cut for the wealthy, i would put it in what i call a lock box. governor bush, your response. i don't know what that was all about, but i'll tell you this, don't mess with texas. i didn't mess with texas. governor bush, i listened very carefully to the vice president's remarks and i honestly don't believe he messed with texas. now governor bush. jim, could i just say that in my plan the lock box would be used only for social security and medicare. it would have two different locks. governor bush -- now -- now one of the keys to the lock box would be kept by the president. the other key would be sealed in a small magnetic container. and placed under the bumper of the senate majority leader's car. governor bush, the next question is for you. two weeks ago at a meeting of the economic club of detroit, you said the following, quote --samore seldom than not, the movies gives us exquisite sex and wholesome violence that underscores our values. every two-child did, i will. end quow. what did you mean by that? pass. really? no idea what that could mean? could be education. jim, i believe that what my opponent intended to say that was all too often the explicit sex and violence in films undermines our values. bingo, that was it. that was it. i happen to agree with governor bush on that and i commend him for it. but let me add something -- let me add something in my plan the lock box would also be camouflaged. now, to all outward appearances it would be a leather bound edition of the count of monte cristo but it wouldn't be. it would be the lock box. governor bush, this question is for you, and it concerns foreign policy. last week in serbian elections, we sought apparent defeat of president slobodan milosevic by challenger yojislav kostunica, yet milosevic refused to step aside. as president, would you apply pressure on milosevic and openly aid kostunica and his party, or by working with neighbors such as the leader of croatia and hungary and greece? well, first of all i think that any instability in that first country you mentioned is troubling . and clearly the second guy you spoke of beat the first guy. personally, i favor seek the diplomatic help of the person i call guy number three. but i'm not going to pronounce -- i'm not going to pronounce any of their names tonight, because i don't believe that's in our national interest. well, that brings us to the close of tonight's debate. each candidate will now give a brief closing statement. jim, could i give two closing statements? i'm afraid not. in fact we're almost out of town so i will instead ask each candidate to sum up in a single word the best argument for his candidacy. governor bush? strategery. vice president gore. lock box. strategery and lock box. hats off to the talented crew of this career's "saturday night live."

The popular uprising that brought Vojislav Kostunica to power in Yugoslavia took a firmer hold on Monday, with the resignation of two crucial allies of Slobodan Milosevic and the announcement of early elections to the Serbian parliament. One of those who resigned was Yugoslav's prime minister, Momir Bulatovic. He had been a Milosevic ally, and his departure means the dismantling of the old federal government. Interior Minister Vlajko Stojiljikovic, another close Milosevic ally, who controls the Serbian police, also resigned. In other encouraging news for the new government, the European Union lifted major sanctions and pledged to contribute about $2 billion in aid to help rebuild Yugoslavia. Milan Milutinovic, the president of Serbia _ the more important of the two remaining republics that comprise Yugoslavia _ and leaders of the parties in the Serbian parliament agreed to dissolve it and call elections for mid-December, probably on Dec. 17. The Serbian parliament, which had been controlled by Milosevic with the Serbian Radical Party of Vojislav Seselj, was not up for election on Sept. 24, when Kostunica defeated Milosevic for the federal presidency and elections were held for the federal parliament. Yet it is in Serbia and in its government where real constitutional power lies, not in the federal government. Under Milosevic, constitutional distinctions mattered less in a system he controlled. But under Kostunica, a constitutional lawyer, the distinctions between the narrow competency of the federal government and the broad powers of the Serbian one will have greater impact. After new elections, almost sure to include voting for a new Serbian president, conflicts within a fragile opposition suddenly in power could become more obvious, and Kostunica's power may be less sweeping than it appears now. In this half-finished revolution, where Kostunica's allies consider Milosevic's continuing control over the Serbian police and special police their greatest danger, the dismantling of the Serbian power structure has been crucial. The new government made an important start on Monday, with the agreement for new Serbian elections and the resignation under pressure of Stojiljikovic, the interior minister. But Rade Markovic, the chief of the secret police, has still not resigned and is feeling more confident about his position, an opposition leader said on Monday night. New Serbian elections should do much to wipe out the parliamentary position of Milosevic's Socialist Party and its coalition partner, the Yugoslav United Left of his wife, Mirjana Markovic. For that reason alone, said Ognjen Pribicevic, an adviser to an opposition leader, the agreements on Monday matter. ``The Socialist Party will be over for now, that's the most important thing, which means that Milosevic will be over,'' he said. ``It means we are entering a new time.'' He also is very concerned about the situation in the manifold layers of the Serbian police that Milosevic pampered and nurtured, even if they were unwilling to shoot at protesters last week. Kostunica's allies want the Interior Ministry job for themselves in what would be a provisional, all-party Serbian government to run the republic until the December elections. But negotiations bogged down on Monday with the parties currently in the Serbian parliament, especially with Seselj, who wants more seats in the new government but who also spoke trenchantly and bitterly about the extra-legal revolutionary capturing of institutions by some of Kostunica's supporters. ``We are not willing to legalize this putsch,'' Seselj said. ``We have been robbed of the police. Everything being done now is unlawful, and we refuse to give it an umbrella of legitimacy. If there a chance to put things back into legal and constitutional boundaries, we will play along. Revolution is revolution, and a putsch is a putsch. It is honorable to be a counterrevolutionary today.'' Seselj has broken with Milosevic and helped Kostunica challenge election fraud. But he is also trying to protect his party, which could suffer badly in new elections, and negotiate a better deal with the new democratic forces. A supporter of Kostunica, Dragan Veselinov, a party leader from Vojvodina, answered: ``This is not about a coup, this is not about a putsch. This is about the will of the people. The people have taken power. That's what this is about. The people spoke at elections you convoked.'' He criticized the Milosevic coalition for hanging on when it has been so thoroughly repudiated and said: ``You are the former ones. You are ghosts from the past. This nation is watching you for the last time. Your faces will no longer be around in December. In nine and a half weeks, people will only see smiles here.'' The bitterness is real. Kostunica talks of constitutional legality, but others in the coalition that backed him fear that if they move too slowly to assert control over every powerful institution, Milosevic and his allies will take advantage of legal niceties and stage a comeback. It is an awkward mix, conceded Cedomir Jovanovic, a top aide to the opposition campaign manager Zoran Djindjic, leader of the Democratic Party. ``We started a process and our intention now is to legitimate that process,'' Jovanovic said. ``But to slow it down or even stop it would be dangerous.'' Seselj's presidential candidate, Tomislav Nikolic, carried the accusation further. ``You would have never proved electoral theft if we had not helped you,'' he said. ``Everything else that carried over into Serbia _ which was not at issue in this election _ is a putsch. It is not the people's will for you to go into universities and take over,'' he said. ``Now you're looking for the government of Serbia to provide you with a veneer of legality,'' Nikolic said. ``You break down doors. You depose and fire people, you come in with guns and pistols. Have any of these here present dictators, as you routinely call them, ever put a gun to any of your heads?'' Seselj then warned that ``this revolution, too, will soon start eating its children,'' especially over the issues of money, benefits and privileges that power brings. Despite the criticism, however, the parliament will be dissolved and a new Serbian government will be negotiated, with opposition membership, that will further dismantle Milosevic's control. The newly elected federal parliament is still squabbling, but the resignation of Bulatovic, the prime minister, makes it more likely that his Montenegrin Socialist Party will go into coalition with Kostunica's supporters in the federal government. Because the September election was boycotted by the Montenegrin president, Milo Djukanovic, the pro-Western leader, he has no seats in the new Yugoslav parliament. But Kostunica wants to find a federal government, possibly made up of technicians and experts, that Djukanovic can tacitly support, at least until new federal elections, which could also come within three months. A decision by the Serbian parliament to reject a motion to scrap a Milosevic law banning political activity at universities brought a few hundred students to protest outside the parliament. They booed Draskovic and staged a march on Milosevic's home in the suburb of Dedinje, which was easily deflected by police. There was a moment of drama when Seselj, a bruising figure, left the parliament, and some of the protesters, saying that he was obstructing democratic change, scuffled with his bodyguards. A weapon was fired into the air, but no one was hurt. There were more moments of revolutionary revenge on Monday. Workers attacked Radoman Bozovic, a Milosevic ally and director of Genex, the largest state-run import-export company. He tried to flee from his car, but he was caught and beaten. His bodyguards snatched him and moved him into a nearby building for safety. Later, Bozovic resigned. In a plaintive appeal, Yugoslavia's defense minister, Gen. Dragoljub Ojdanic, urged Milosevic's allies to rally. Otherwise, he said in an open letter, the Serbs might face extinction as a people, saying that ``disunity among the Serbs is inciting the plans of our proven enemies'' to occupy the country, referring to allegations that the opposition here is subject to NATO control.

Sirimavo Bandaranaike, the world's first female prime minister, died of a heart attack Tuesday after voting in parliamentary elections, a government spokeswoman said. Bandaranaije had retired at the age of 84 last month to let her daughter, President Chandrika Kumaratunga, appoint a hard-liner in the fight against Tamil separatists ahead of the elections. Bandaranaike had gone to Gampaha, her home town, 22 miles east of Colombo to cast her vote. She died on the way home, spokeswoman Kusum Rodrigo said.

After shunning America during the election campaign, President Vojislav Kostunica's allies are reaching out to the West as they seek to rid the government of the last remnants of Slobodan Milosevic's regime. ``Without a strategic partnership with America, there is no solution for the Serbian national interests,'' key aide Zoran Djindjic said. Kostunica shunned contacts with the United States during the campaign for the Sept. 24 election because of Serb anger over last year's NATO bombing campaign. But the country is destitute. Many Yugoslavs want an end to the international isolation imposed on their country after the Balkan wars of the Milosevic era. Kostunica planned to meet Tuesday with French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine, who will be the first Cabinet minister of a NATO country which bombed Yugoslavia to visit Belgrade after last week's uprising against Milosevic. Vedrine's visit comes one day after the European Union lifted economic sanctions against Yugoslavia and offered $2 billion in aid to help rebuild the country. Anxious to shore up his power base, Kostunica is putting his own supporters in charge of the country's most important institutions, including the police, judiciary, banks and state-run companies. Milosevic remains out of public view, holed up at one of the president's official residences in a Belgrade suburb. But two of his key allies, federal Prime Minister Momir Bulatovic and Serbian Interior Minister Vlajko Stojiljkovic _ who controlled about 100,000 policemen _ stepped down Monday, along with Serbian Health Minister Milovan Bojic. All major Serbian parties agreed to early elections for the Serbian parliament, a move which could help remove much of what remains of Milosevic's base. Serbia is home to more than 90 percent of Yugoslavs. The Serbian parliament holds considerable authority in Yugoslavia, which also includes tiny Montenegro. Still, the pro-Milosevic Serbian government refused Monday to step down immediately in favor of an administration dominated by economic experts. As long as the Serbian government remains in place, it could block many pro-democracy reforms at the federal level. Serbia's president and parliament are elected separately from federal posts and were not involved in the contentious federal vote Sept. 24. Serbian President Milan Milutinovic and other Serbian government leaders were elected in 1998 to four-year terms. In the streets, factories and other public places, anger against Milosevic's cronies sometimes boiled over into violence. Crowds in Belgrade beat Radoman Bozovic, a close Milosevic aide and the director of a major Belgrade trading corporation. He subsequently resigned. In Nis, workers stormed the state-run textile factory, Nitex, demanding the management be fired. Employees of Investbanka demanded that Borka Vucic, a top financial associate of Milosevic, leave the Belgrade headquarters of the state-run bank because ``her safety is jeopardized.'' In a last-ditch appeal to Milosevic supporters, Yugoslavia's defense minister Gen. Dragoljub Ojdanic urged people not to abandon the ousted leader. Ojdanic, a close Milosevic ally who has also been indicted for war crimes, has not formally recognized Kostunica as the new Yugoslav president and is not expected to keep his position in the new government. He has no direct control of the military, which has fallen under Kostunica's command. Still, he retains influence among the military brass, and any call he might make to rally pro-Milosevic forces could be problematic for the new regime. China, once a staunch Milosevic supporter, refused to let his son Marko Milosevic into the country Monday. Traveling on a diplomatic passport, the younger Milosevic arrived at Beijing's Capital Airport from Russia. Officials there stopped him and quickly put him back on the Aeroflot flight to Moscow, Russian reporters said. The Aeroflot plane later arrived back at Moscow's international airport, but Milosevic did not appear in the arrivals area. The Russian Foreign Ministry and Yugoslav Embassy in Moscow had no word on his whereabouts.

A Russian and two U.S.-based researchers won the Nobel Prize in physics Tuesday for work that helped create modern information technology, leading to everyday devices like pocket calculators, CD players and cell phones. Also Tuesday, the chemistry prize went to two Americans and a Japanese scientist for their discoveries that plastic can be made electrically conductive. The work by winners Alan J. Heeger, Alan G. MacDiarmid and Hideki Shirakawa has spurred improvements in film, TV screens and windows and could eventually lead to a host of new technologies, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said. ``The physics prizes are about the electronics of today and the chemistry prizes are about the electronics of the future,'' academy member Per Ahlberg said. In physics, Zhores I. Alferov of the A.F. Ioffe Physico-Technical Institute in St. Petersburg, Russia, and Herbert Kroemer, a German-born researcher at the University of California at Santa Barbara, will share half the prize for work in developing technology used in satellite communications and cellular phones. Jack Kilby, 76, of Texas Instruments in Dallas will get the other half for his part in the invention and development of the integrated circuit, the forerunner of the microchip, and as a co-inventor of the pocket calculator. The prize this year is worth $915,000. Hermann Grimmeiss, a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, said the work of the three men had been invaluable in the development of modern information technology. ``Without Kilby it would not have been possible to build the personal computers we have today, and without Alferov it would not be possible to transfer all the information from satellites down to the earth or to have so many telephone lines between cities,'' Grimmeiss said. The academy in this year's selections cited scientists for their work in a practical realm instead of more esoteric branches of physics like subatomic particles and quantum physics that have been honored the previous two years. Kroemer and Alferov, 70, were cited as being early leaders in semiconductor research that has been used in mobile phones and satellite links. The same technology is used to build laser diodes, which drive the flow of information on the Internet and are found in compact disc players, bar-code readers and laser pointers. Kilby's work led to the microchip, which has ``led to our environment being flooded with small electronic apparatuses, anything from electronic watches and TV games to mini-calculators and personal computers,'' according to the citation. Reached by phone at his institute in St. Petersburg, Alferov said, ``My colleagues and I are now going to uncork a bottle of champagne and celebrate.'' Asked whether he expected the honor, he said, ``Not really, but maybe a very little bit.'' The three winners were cited for work done independently. In chemistry, laureates Heeger, MacDiarmid and Shirakawa will share the $915,000 prize for the ``discovery and development of conductive polymers,'' according to the academy's citation. Heeger, 64, of the University of California at Santa Barbara, MacDiarmid, 73, of the University of Pennsylvania and Shirakawa, 64, of the University of Tsukuba learned that plastics can, with modifications, be made to conduct electricity as well as insulate. The three developed conductive polymers that have been used to reduce static electricity and interference on photographic film and computer screens. The plastics have also been used in the development of new color television screens and ``smart windows'' that reflect sunlight. The joint work of the three researchers in Philadelphia also led to the development of light-emitting diodes in plastics. The so-called ``brilliant plastics'' could eventually produce flat television screens and luminous traffic and information signs that don't need bulbs, the academy said. ``This (research) will open up entirely new areas that we've only seen the beginning of,'' Ahlberg said. A week of Nobel awards started Monday with the naming of Arvid Carlsson of Sweden, Paul Greengard and Eric Kandel of the United States, as the winners of this year's medicine prize for discoveries about how messages are transmitted between brain cells, leading to treatments of Parkinson's disease and depression. The economics prize was to be announced Wednesday and the literature prize on Thursday in Stockholm. The coveted peace prize will be awarded Friday in Oslo, Norway. Alfred Nobel, the wealthy Swedish industrialist and inventor of dynamite, endowed the physics, chemistry, literature, medicine and peace prizes in his will but left only vague guidelines for the selection committees. The economics prize was first awarded in 1969. The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, which also chooses the physics and economics winners, invited nominations from previous recipients and experts in the fields before whittling down its choices, but deliberations are conducted in strict privacy. Ahmed Zewail, an Egyptian-American, won last year's chemistry prize for pioneering the use of rapid-fire laser flashes that illuminate the motion of atoms in a molecule. The prizes always are presented Dec. 10, the anniversary of Nobel's death in 1896. ___ On the Net: http://www.nobel.se

A Serbian journalist, Miroslav Filipovic, walked free from a military prison here on Tuesday, the first political prisoner to be released since the democratic opposition wrested power from Slobodan Milosevic last week. The Supreme Military Court in Belgrade ordered his release pending retrial, ruling that there had been serious violations of legal procedure in his trial. The new leadership of Yugoslavia under President Vojislav Kostunica appears to have influenced the decision, since it released news that he would be freed the day before the ruling. Sentenced to seven years and imprisoned five months ago for reporting on Yugoslav army war crimes in Kosovo, Filipovic was one of three Serbian political prisoners who rights groups and democratic leaders said were victims of Milosevic's increasingly vindictive regime. Some 700 ethnic Albanians from Kosovo are also in Serbian jails, the majority considered political prisoners because they were detained arbitrarily during the war in Kosovo last year. And in perhaps the most serious case of all, the whereabouts of a former Yugoslav president, Ivan Stambolic, who was abducted a month ago, remain unknown. His wife and his lawyer say Milosevic was behind his disappearance. Since Oct. 5, when Milosevic's power crumbled in the face of public outrage, Barbara Davis, representative of the U.N. high commissioner for human rights, and other rights advocates have appealed to the new leaders to focus on victims of rights abuses. ( Kostunica has not issued an amnesty but has said he wants politics out of the courtroom, a European diplomat said.) The appeals have resulted in the release without charges of seven European foreigners, caught in recent months without visas and accused of spying by the state media. Dozens of protesters arrested during demonstrations Thursday in Serbia were also released. Filipovic's release gives hope to the remaining political prisoners, some of whom face sentences as long as 20 years. It is a sign that the military is moving with the new democratic changes. But Stambolic's case looks particularly desperate; rights advocates fear he has been killed _ the last of a string of murder victims of the Milosevic regime. He was kidnapped on Aug. 25 while out jogging. It took five days for the state media to mention his disappearance, which his lawyer, Nikola Barovic, said led him to suspect state involvement. The abduction occurred during the presidential election campaign, a period of increased repression, police surveillance and attacks on critics of Milosevic. The police have failed to produce any leads, and the justice minister has denied that Stambolic is being detained in any jail in Serbia. When the United Nations inquired about his whereabouts, another minister accused a U.N. envoy, Jiri Dienstbier, of complicity in the abduction. But at least Filipovic can celebrate. He hugged his wife, Slavica, in front of the military prison in Nis, home to the Third Army, which did the bulk of the fighting in Kosovo. ``The hardest time of my life was spent in Nis,'' he said. ``For much of the time I did not know what was going on outside. I did not know how much time I would spend without my family.'' Filipovic, 49, had been reporting from the southern town of Kraljevo for the national daily Danas and the Agence France-Presse news service. His arrest came after the publication of an explosive story he wrote in April for the Institute for War and Peace Reporting on the Yugoslav army's participation in atrocities in Kosovo. He interviewed unidentified army officers who described comrades committing atrocities. He also referred to an internal army report that revealed a crisis of morale at the prospect of another war looming in neighboring Montenegro. The interview was published in English and, though it did not appear in Serbia, was available on the Internet. Filipovic said he thought it was the reference to the plans for war in Montenegro that caused his arrest. But fellow journalists ascribed it to his reporting witnesses' accounts of war crimes and linking them to the Milosevic regime. ``I spent five months inside for no reason,'' he said, ``but that is the fate of journalists in our country, although that time is past now.'' He said that a radio had helped him follow the momentous protests ending Milosevic's rule, and that he had swung from desperation to hope during the last weeks, some of them spent in solitary. ``Suddenly I had a feeling of hope, and there is no place with less hope than prison.''

Three scientists who pioneered work on the microchip and semiconductors won the Nobel Prize for physics Tuesday, a recognition of their fundamental roles in the creation of the computer age and an instant electronic world of mobile phones, CD players, bar-code readers and the Internet. The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, which chooses the science and economics awards, also announced the chemistry prize Tuesday, singling out two Americans and a Japanese scientist for discovering that plastics can conduct electricity, leading to developments involving photographic film, computer screen shields and ``smart'' windows that can block sunlight. The winners of the physics prize are Zhores I. Alferov, director of the A.F. Ioffe Physico-Technical Institute in St. Petersburg, Russia, and Herbert Kroemer of the University of California at Santa Barbara, Calif., who will each receive a quarter of the $915,000 prize; and Jack S. Kilby, a longtime scientist at Texas Instruments, who will receive the remaining half. Unlike past awards for theoretical and abstract advances, this year's prize went to men whose work deeply changed the everyday world. ``Through their inventions this year's Nobel laureates in physics have laid a stable foundation for modern information technology,'' the academy said. Kilby, 76, was honored for his role in inventing the integrated circuit, or computer chip. ``Through this invention microelectronics has grown to become the basis of modern technology,'' the academy said, citing powerful computers and processors which control washing machines and cars, space probes and medical diagnostic equipment. Kilby, who holds more than 60 U.S. patents, built the first electronic circuit just after starting at Texas Instruments in 1958, and also headed teams that created the hand-held calculator. The circuit replaced the bulky transistor, and allowed electronic devices to shrink immeasurably. ``I don't know that the information age has one father,'' he told reporters outside his home in Dallas. ``I think it has a lot of fathers. A lot of contributions have gone into it.'' Kilby also expressed surprise that his work would be honored with the physics prize. ``I had thought that Nobel prizes were not given for accomplishments like mine,'' he said. ``To some extent, my contribution was an engineering one and Mr. Nobel did not make any provisions for engineering prizes.'' Hand-in-hand with the computer revolution came the telecommunications revolution, a fact recognized by giving shares of the award to Kroemer, born in Germany in 1928, and Alferov, born in the Soviet Union in 1930. The two were cited for separately developing and inventing layered semiconductor structures, called ``semiconductor heterostructures.'' The structures gave rise to super-fast transistors and semiconductor lasers, which ``are playing a decisive part in modern telecommunications,'' the academy said. These transistors are used in satellite communications and mobile phone connections. And such semiconductor lasers are used in fibre-optics, CD reading heads and bar-code readers Alferov, 70, is the first Russian to win a Nobel since Mikhail Gorbachev won the Peace Prize in 1990. Alferov, a member of the Communist Party, said he would immediately appeal for more state spending on science. The chemistry prize winners were Alan J. Heeger and Alan G. MacDiarmid of the United States and Hideki Shirakawa of Japan. Plastic was long considered to only be an insulator, rather than conductor, but the three scientists discovered in the late 1970s that an electric current could pass through plastic after the material was modified. The scientists discovered that a thin film-like kind of plastic could be oxidized, vastly increasing its electrical conductivity. The discovery has led to polymers that reduce static electricity, which can interfere with photographic film and computer screens. In addition to the practical applications in windows, computers and film, the academy said the work has contributed to advances in small television screens and has helped speed advances in molecular electronics. Heeger, 64, was born in Iowa and is currently a professor of physics at the University of California, Santa Barbara. MacDiarmid, 73, was born in New Zealand but is an American citizen and professor of chemistry at the University of Pennsylvania. Shirakawa, 64, was born in Tokyo and is a professor of chemistry at the University of Tsukuba. He transformed polyacetylene into a metallic-looking film by accident in the early 1970s, when he added too much catalyst in a chemical reaction. At the time, MacDiarmid and Heeger were also working on a polymer that gleamed like silver. Shirakawa met MacDiarmid by chance at a coffee break during a Tokyo conference. When the men heard about each other's discoveries they began working together. The three men learned how to oxidize polyacetylene and give it metallic properties and then published their discovery in 1977. The economics prize will be announced Wednesday, the literature prize on Thursday and the peace prize on Friday. On Monday, Arvid Carlsson of Sweden, Paul Greengard and Eric Kandel, both of the United States, won the medicine prize for their discovery of how messages are transmitted between brain cells.

Hoping to improve ties with a bitter antagonist, a top North Korean official carried an unprecedented message to President Clinton on Tuesday outlining proposals to expand on progress Pyongyang has made in easing tensions with a longtime U.S. ally, South Korea. The letter from North Korean leader Kim Jong Il was delivered to Clinton by a senior military aide, Jo Myong Rok, whose visit to the White House represented another milestone in the developing U.S.-North Korean relationship. The message appeared to be part of a North Korean effort to keep up the momentum generated by the breakthrough summit the leaders of the two Koreas held in June. White House spokesman Jake Siewert said Kim's letter spelled out a number of ways in which the North Koreans ``might further the exchange of ideas about how to lower tensions in the Korean peninsula.'' Siewart provided no details. Ambassador Wendy Sherman, the top State Department official for North Korea policy, characterized the 45-minute meeting between Clinton and Jo as ``very positive, direct and warm.'' ``They both agreed that the Inter-Korean summit has created an opportunity for this historic meeting here today,'' she said. Jo is described by U.S. officials as the right hand man to Kim. His official title is first vice chairman of the National Defense Commission, ranking him second in line to Kim, who serves as chairman. On arrival in Washington on Monday night, Jo said his visit was designed to remove ``deeply rooted and age-old distrust and make an epochal change in advancing the relations between our two countries onto a new stage.'' The friendly comments on both sides contrasted sharply with the relationship's official status: no diplomatic relations between the two and the presence of 37,000 American troops in South Korea to guard against a possible North Korean invasion. It was not long ago that the north was routinely dismissed here as a self-isolating pariah state. Pyongyang, in turn, customarily resorted to the most strident invective to describe the United States. Jo took the somewhat unusual step of showing up for his White House meeting in full dress military uniform after wearing a business suit to an earlier meeting with Secretary of State Madeleine Albright. Sherman said Jo's appearance at the White House in his uniform demonstrated that ``all segments'' of North Korean society, including the military, support an improvement of relations with Washington. At the State Department, spokesman Richard Boucher said the next step in the process of accommodation could be an Albright visit to Pyongyang. For the United States, the most serious issue is North Korea's development of an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of reaching the United States and its export of missiles to Iran and Syria. Pyongyang, in turn, resents that the State Department includes North Korea on its list of countries that sponsor international terrorism. North Korea promised last week that it opposes all forms of terrorism and believes that all U.N. member states must refrain from such activity. The vow came in a communique signed with the United States. U.S. officials said the commitment helped bring North Korea closer to removal from the terrorism list but that the North still must take additional measures. Sherman said Clinton and Jo did not negotiate these issues during their meeting. More substantive talks with Jo are planned for Wednesday at the State Department and the Pentagon. After Jo left the White House, he was driven past several Washington monuments and then, back in civilian clothes, ventured across the Potomac River to visit George Washington's mansion at Mount Vernon. Jo was animated and smiling, asking questions as tour guide Peg Pokusa told him history of the house. A woman in 18th century dress with a blue shawl was in the downstairs rooms as Jo visited. He posed for pictures in front of the house with the guide and the 13 people in his party. North Korea has always been a divisive issue on Capitol Hill, with Republicans questioning the administration's approach. The chairman of the House International Relations Committee, Benjamin Gilman, R-N.Y. reflected that wariness in a brief statement. ``I sincerely hope that after six years of engagement and nearly a billion dollars in American aid that this high level visit results in some real progress toward reducing military tensions on the Korean peninsula, limiting the North Korean missile program and proliferation, instituting economic reforms to address the food shortages and advancing human rights in North Korea,'' he said. Republican sources said Gilman was not invited to a State Department meeting Tuesday evening with Jo. Democratic sources said a number of Republicans were invited but only one, Sen. Craig Thomas of Wyoming, who heads a subcommittee on Asian affairs, decided to attend. Craig also was the only Republican among eight lawmakers who were on a guest list, estimated at 200 people, for a dinner Albright was hosting Tuesday night in Jo's honor at the State Department. ___ On the Net: State Department: http://www.state.gov

A high ranking Russian official says, the 14-year-old space station has no scientific technical value and should be ditched. U.S. space officials agree. They want Russia to concentrate its scare resources on the international space station but at least one man is banking literally on the Mir staying in orbit. He wants to produce an NBC reality series. The grand prize for the winning contest, a 10-day mission to the Mir. Now, if that idea sounds like a long shot, keep in mind that this TV producer has a track record, he did Survivor. The World's technology correspondent, Rebecca Roberts reports. Television producer, Mark Barnet is a popular guy these days. In a quick interview before he caught a plane to start production on Survivor II in the Australian outback, Barnet acknowledged he could produce almost anything he wants. The only reason Survivor worked for me because the very passion about the whole point of it, about two people marooned on an island making a world. And then they try pretty much eating itself in a way bugs out each other off. So, hopefully, it would be as successful if I were produce it in parts I would really care about. And what Barnet really cares about includes conquering space as the final commercial frontier. When he read that U.S. businessman Dennis Teto had paid 20 million dollars to take a trip to the Russian space station Mir, Barnet got the idea for a new TV series. You know, he has got that money and he has his own right to spend his own money. How would someone who couldn't afford those very large sums ever hope to go, you know, into outer space? And so I am thinking about a TV show that would be a chance for a way for a network to make money, and in so doing, also allow an ordinary person to afford to go to space. And so was born destination Mir. Applicants would go through a through physical and psychological screening process. Those who make the cut, will be sent to the cosmonaut training center at Star City outside of Moscow. There training will be televised and each week Russian space officials will eliminate one contestant. The ultimate winner gets a ticket to Mir. That might sound like a dubious prize, given Mir's troubled history, but the show's producers insist millions of dollars have been spent to refurbish the aging space station. Barnet had to clear his ideas with the folks at Mir Corp, a company based in the Netherlands that acts as a sort of booking agent for the space station. Jeffery Manber is CEO of Mir Corp. It was his job to pitch the idea to the Russians. I sat down with Dr. Seumianoff, the head of Anergia, the major Russian company in space and said, "Are you willing to work with normal people, not people who are trained astronauts? Are you willing to have tourists visiting the station?" When Anergia heard tourists, the company saw dollar signs. The company has been struggling to support Mir through more traditional sources. The TV contestants training at Star City will be rigorous. Participants will have to have excellent technical skills and the ability to master extraordinary detail. Next to NASA's Aims Research Center in Silicon Valley, there is a space camp that gives an idea what life will be like at Star City. The program is designed to simulate astronaut training for kids. The huge training center includes two mockups of the front and of space shuttle orbiters. They are very close to the true scale. We can go ahead and go inside. Okay. The simulated space shuttle flight deck is realistically complex with buttons and switches on every available surface. Space camp manager, Becky Greneus explains. Before their mission they get what is called as shuttle orientation and a mission orientation, going over all the basics and the goal is to get through it and solve different problems along the way. And then there are the physical challenges. Astronauts in training have to master simulated micro-gravity and the change in the physics of movement in outer space. At space camp there is a contraption on springs that mimics the awkward movements of a moonwalk. What you are going to do is you are going to leave your feet on the ground as long as you can. Valerie is going to raise you up until you are about just above, your feet will be on the ground. Okay. It's not as easy as it sounds but the folks at space camp emphasize, it's not always the smartest or the strongest people who make the best astronauts, although, brains and brawn can't hurt. Intangible skills like leadership, working well in a team and keeping a cool head under pressure count for a lot. Survivor Executive Producer, Mark Barnet agrees. The winner of Destination Mir he says will need very different skills than the winner of Survivor. To win Survivor you need to be a political maestro. Richard was that, who knew how to be a good politician. Just go space has nothing to do with that. It's all about your ability to think in hard situations and be a good valuable part of team. NBC plans to officially launch the program in early 2002, provided Mir stays in orbit that long. The final episode is supposed to be a live broadcast of the winner shooting to Mir on a Russian Souz rocket. For The World, I am Rebecca Roberts.

Milosevic himself is lying low these days in a government villa in Belgrade. He is reportedly using words such as "street coup" to describe the riots that toppled him and he is said to be planning a political comeback. All of this might suggest a man out of touch with reality, but when The World's Jennifer Glass visited the town where Milosevic is firm, the reality she found wasn't as simple as you might have thought. The gates of Bamby Park were closed on this blustery day. This children's theme park in Slobodan Milosevic's home town called the "Reeve hut" was built last year at the height of the NATO bombing at Serbia by Milosevic's son Marco. Now Bamby Park is deserted, desolate, like all of Marco's businesses in Pasriavach. On the town's main street is the remains of Marco's cybernet shop. It sold telephones and electronic equipment. There is nothing left but broken glass. 17-year-old Myer Revonish explains what happened. One man said, "Let's go in Cybernet" and started to smash windows and they take TV and telephones and everything and they smashed, that's all." Why did they destroy that? Because it was Marco Milosevic's. He is the son of the President and took money from the workers and he built this. It is not his. Many Yugoslavs say the younger Milosevic is a symbol of everything that was wrong with his father's rule. Marco fled to Moscow over the weekend with his wife and young son. Monday he tried to get into China but was refused entry. He is a coward. He is a bad man. He deserves to die. I think that we need change in this country. Change is on the way. From his Opposition supporters like Slavo Yubnoticks, who represents the new President Vojislav Kostunica's political alliance in Pasriavach. Matic says when Marco Milosevic left, so too did the thugs that used to terrorize the town. Now we have no black jeeps with black windows. We have no kitkats with black jackets and I think that we can now too live normal life. There are lots of stories about Marco in his Islykies and Pasriavach. Last May, in what some believe were the first signs of the Milosevic regime was near its end, Marco's bodyguards beat up several students who opposed the Milosevic government. The students were then accused of attempted murder. The charge was so outrageous, the judge and public prosecutor resigned. Matic says since the changeover of power last week, he has been asked a lot about Marco and the Milosevic legacy. Enough he says. Marco Milosevic for us is history and now we have to look for our future not for Marco Milosevic. Marco Milosevic is product of politics of his father and now Marco Milosevic and Slobodan Milosevic for us only history. But not everyone in Pasriavach is happy to see the end of the Milosevic era. Just go to City Home where Bion Cosmeniovic is Deputy Mayor and a member of the Socialist People Party of Serbia or SPS. Slobodan Milosevic is its President. Cosminovic is still fiercely loyal to Milosevic and with a bright face on his loss in last month's elections. As President Milosevic said it is good for every political party to be in a position to get rid of the members that came into the party just to be privileged and it is good for SPS to be in a position to find the way to recover itself. Cosminovic, who has been in office in Pasriavich for several years, begins sweating when asked about the younger Milosevic. He insists that Marco believed to be a multimillionaire, had no improper business dealings in Yugoslavia and he left the country for personal reasons. Over his desk Cosminovic has a picture of Slobodan Milosevic. I keep this picture because he was President of my country. And will you have a picture of the new President in your office? We have a picture of Mr. Kostunica here. no. Cosminovic blames the West for his party's defeat. Economic sanctions that crippled the country's economy, he said, turned the voters against Milosevic, but he believes it is not the end for the former President, that he can remain in politics. That's what Slobodan Milosevic promised to do in his concession speech Friday night when on National Television he acknowledged that he had lost the election, said he was looking forward to spending more time with his family and pledged to build a strong Opposition. There is no question that Milosevic does still have a following here, nearly 2 million people did vote for him in last month's elections. Sitting in a Belgrade cafe, writer Slava Jukic says the downfall of Milosevic has left a void in his own life. He has been following Milosevic closely for a decade. He has talked to friends and business associates learning everything he could. Jukic says for 10 years, it is as though he has lived with Milosevic, always thinking about what the man was doing. I wrote four books about him and still I cannot really understand him. Jukic is the Kitty Caley of Yugoslavia. His unauthorized biographies of Milosevic and his wife are popular and highly respected. He says, he has never seen a relationship like the one between Milosevic and his wife Mira. They met in high school in Pasariavich and have been inseparable ever since. Mira was the power behind throne he says. She built Milosevic's career and in the end he says, she pushed him too far. Still, says Jugic, what a career it has been. Milosevic is a man without any beliefs. He was in his life everything that the man could be. He was a passionate Yugoslav, a passionate nationalist. He was in one way a peacekeeper and in other way, he wanted war. Milosevic started and lost four Balkan wars. Last year's Kosovo conflict ultimately helped and hurt him. NATO's 7 to 8 days of bombing of Yugoslavia gave Milosevic a common enemy to rally the people against. On the streets of Belgrade there are plentiful postcards of bombed up buildings potraying the Serbs as victims of the West. The economic sanctions that accompanied the conflict and are partially lifted on Monday, helped further isolate an impoverished Yugoslavia and its people. Many of Milosevic observers believe his popular support had been waning since the early 1990s and he was able to keep his grip on power only through manipulating the media, dividing the opposition and using special police and military forces to quell possible uprisings. But last week, the voices of the public grew too loud. Even the military and police deserted him, joining demonstrations in favor of the opposition. On his own, Milosevic seemed to have little choice but to step down. The man who replaced him, Vojislav Kostunica, says what happens to Milosevic now is not a top priority for the new government. Although Milosevic isn't entitled war criminal, some Western nations have softened their demands that he be transferred to the Hague to face war crimes charges. Many Serbs believe he should be tried here. A 20-year-old Yovano Mikhailovic couldn't care less. I just want him to disappear from my life forever. That's all. We don't wish anything else. Just some little bit of peace in this country. In a Belgrade park, a group of elderly Serbs dance a folk dance. For them Milosevic was a hero because he did his best to create a greater Serbia for Serbs would dominate where they believed life would be good for everyone. It is little been on Milosevic's step down last week, that dream was consigned to history, at least for now. For The World, I am Jennifer Glass in Belgrade.

President Chandrika Kumaratunga's ruling party appeared on the verge of winning a majority of Parliament seats Wednesday on a promise to end the country's 17-year civil war. With more than 90 percent of the vote in the Parliament election tallied, Kumaratunga's People's Alliance had 48 percent of the vote, or 88 seats in the 225-member Parliament. The opposition United National Party was next with 39 percent and 72 seats. Other parties were winning the balance of the seats. With the votes in one district still to be counted, the elections commissioner announced that the final results would not be made public until Thursday. Tuesday's vote in this island nation off India's southern tip was tumultuous, marked by violence, death and accusations of vote rigging. With a 10 p.m. curfew imposed, many people remained at home Wednesday, monitoring state radio and television for results. Soldiers patrolled the capital with AK-47s slung over their shoulders, stopping cars at checkpoints. The driving election issue was the civil war between rebels of the Tamil minority and the government, which is dominated by majority Sinhalese. The violence has raged for 17 years, leaving 63,000 people dead and displacing an additional 1 million people. Kumaratunga _ who lost vision in one eye in a Tamil Tiger rebel suicide bombing on Dec. 18 _ has sought to push through a new constitution granting more autonomy to the provinces in an effort to placate Tamils and sideline rebels fighting for a separate homeland in the north and east. With only a one-seat majority in the last Parliament, members of Parliament blocked her attempts to pass the constitution, so Kumaratunga saw Tuesday's vote as a referendum on her plan. Though Kumaratunga has pledged to bring an end to the war, her government has spent some $375 million in military hardware and weapons in recent months, Army Brig. Sanath Karunatellike told The Associated Press. The hardware was purchased from China, Pakistan, Ukraine and Czechoslovakia. ``She will keep the military option open, because given the track record of the LTTE (Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam), she cannot afford to lower her guard,'' said Jehan Perera, an analyst with the National Peace Council, an independent think tank. ``If the political efforts fail, she may have no other option but to go flat out after the separatists,'' he said. Although the People's Alliance gained the most seats in the 225-member Parliament, it still needs at least 113 seats to form its own government without resorting to a coalition. Deputy Elections Commissioner K. Senanayake said that 75 percent of the 12 million registered voters cast ballots in the country's 11th parliamentary elections on Tuesday. At least 71 people were killed during the five-week campaign and on polling day, according to the independent Center for Monitoring Election Violence. The elections were also marred by the death of former Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike, 84, who died of a heart attack moments after voting. A state funeral will be held Saturday for Bandaranaike, the world's first female prime minister and Kumaratunga's mother. ___ On the Net: Tamil rebels: http://www.eelamweb.com Sri Lankan government: http://www.priu.gov.lk

A U.S. Navy ship in port on the Arabian Peninsula was struck Thursday by a small boat in an apparent terrorist act that killed at least four Americans and injured at least 30, the Defense Department said. Another sailor was missing. The registry of the boat was not immediately known, and no one has claimed responsibility, U.S. officials said. The destroyer USS Cole, with a crew of about 350 sailors, was in port at Aden, Yemen, for refueling when it was rammed and an explosion followed, according to Lt. Cmdr. Daren Pelkie, spokesman for the Navy's 5th Fleet headquarters in Manama, Bahrain. Details of the incident were sketchy, but officials at the Pentagon said it appeared that the small boat was carrying some form of high-explosive powerful enough to rip a large hole in the side of the U.S. ship. President Clinton was notified of the incident at his home in Chappaqua, N.Y., by his national security adviser, Sandy Berger, said White House spokesman Jake Siewert. The president called Defense Secretary William Cohen, urging him and Berger to find out what happened. ``He's obviously troubled by it,'' Siewert said. ``He wants to know what happened.'' Siewert said the incident ``appears to be a terrorist bombing but we don't know what happened.'' The president also talked by phone with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat. The ship attack came on a day of new violence between Israelis and Palestinians. Because the Cole had just arrived in Aden and was due to remain there only for four hours to take on fuel, U.S. officials said they believed the boat's mission was a planned act of terrorism. The ship had transited the Suez Canal on Monday and sailed down the Red Sea before arriving in Aden on the Gulf of Aden, Pelkie said. U.S. Navy ships commonly stop in Aden for refueling. The region has been swept in recent weeks by demonstrations, some of them violent and often with an anti-U.S. tone, sparked by Israeli-Palestinian clashes in Israel and the Palestinian territories. Pro-Palestinian rallies have been held daily in Yemen. Thursday's explosion was heard all over Aden and ambulances were seen rushing to the port. The injured were removed to local hospitals and the Navy was flying a medical team from Bahrain. At about 12:15 p.m. local time, or 5:15 a.m. EDT, a U.S. Army major who works at the U.S. Embassy in Aden saw a small rubber boat of unknown nationality ram the destroyer, tearing a 20-foot-by-40-foot hole in the port side, Pelkie said. The spokesman said that in addition to four Americans killed, five were seriously injured and a total of 31 suffered some form of injury. He said one American also was missing. Flooding aboard the Cole was contained and no fires were reported, the spokesman said. The ship was listing four degrees to its port side after the explosion. The Cole is a ship of the Burke destroyer class and carries sophisticated Aegis weaponry. Its home port is Norfolk, Va. It was en route to the Persian Gulf. Yemen is on the southern tip of the Arabian Peninsula on the Red Sea. ___ On the Net: USS Cole is at http://www.spear/navy.mil/ships/ddg67/

The State Department said Secretary of State Madeleine Albright was placing a call to Ali Abdallah Salih, the president of Yemen, to discuss the incident. At the Justice Department, Attorney General Janet Reno declined to comment on a possible terrorist link. She said a team of FBI agents was en route to the scene. Asked if consideration is being given to putting on a worldwide terrorist alert at U.S. installations, she said, ``That is an issue that is being addressed.''

Slobodan Milosevic's party announced leadership changes Thursday as it struggled to stem the steady erosion of its power and influence to the newly elected president, Vojislav Kostunica. In a gesture of Washington's support for Kostunica, President Clinton on Thursday began lifting U.S. trade and economic sanctions against Yugoslavia. The Socialists, meanwhile, said their hard-line secretary-general, Gorica Gajevic, had been replaced by the more moderate Zoran Andjelkovic, head of the Serb-run Kosovo government. Serbian President Milan Milutinovic was named the party's vice president. Milosevic apparently remained at the helm despite losing the presidency in the Sept. 24 elections. The Beta news agency later quoted Miloje Mihajlovic, a Socialist deputy in the Serbian parliament, as saying Milosevic would resign ``because of the members and supporters'' and that further changes in the party were ``necessary.'' The Socialists called a party congress for Nov. 25. There were also signs of a rift between the Socialists and their neo-communist allies, the Yugoslav Left, the party of Milosevic's influential wife, Mirjana Markovic. Both parties said unlike in last month's elections, their candidates would run independently in the next Serbian elections. The shake-up could mean Milosevic is trying to consolidate his followers after their ouster from power so he can remain a political player. Analyst Bratislav Grubacic, however, suggested Milutinovic might be trying to take over the party by sacking its staunchest hard-liners. ``The final showdown with Milosevic will be at the party congress,'' Grubacic said. Allies of the current and ousted president are locked in a power struggle as Kostunica seeks to dismantle the last vestiges of Milosevic's authoritarian regime and open ties to the West. Kostunica's camp gave Milosevic loyalists until Friday to agree to early December parliamentary elections in Serbia, the dominant republic of Yugoslavia. ``If they don't schedule the elections as agreed, we will call the people to the streets and squares to demand new elections,'' said Zoran Djindjic, Kostunica's senior adviser. Djindjic said the pro-democracy movement had in the meantime established contacts with the Socialists to discuss an agreement on forming a transitional Serbian government and holding elections. The deadline to the Socialists followed attempts by Milosevic officials to reclaim control over the 100,000-strong Serbian police and government posts the ousted president's followers still hold. Serbia's deputy premier, ultranationalist Vojislav Seselj, insisted Thursday that the government will not resign unless the Kostunica camp stops the ongoing takeover of Serbia's institutions. ``The coup leaders taking control of one institution after another. That's a criminal act,'' Seselj declared. ``We as the government in fact do not exist, we exist only formally.'' But Seselj also warned ``they will have to execute or mob us'' if an agreement is not reached. He urged Kostunica to name the federal prime minister as soon as possible, and ``bring things back into the institutions.'' The army resisted efforts Wednesday by Kostunica to replace its pro-Milosevic top brass. The general staff has officially endorsed the new president but Milosevic's loyalists retain chief posts. Milosevic's Socialists said the ``lawlessness and violence'' inspired by the pro-democracy forces must end before they continue negotiations on new elections and Serbia's government and the dissolving of the republic's parliament. The insistence on early elections came as tensions began to build throughout the country after Serbia's government said it was retaking control of the police and that its institutions were the only legal bodies fit to rule. ``That (Serbian) government can declare itself ... omnipotent, but it's a fact of life they have no control over 80 percent of the processes in the country,'' Djindjic said. The threats from pro-Milosevic forces appeared to have little support, and there was no sign of any unusual police movement. A senior police official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said orders from the pro-Milosevic group would be ignored. Kostunica said despite ``disruptive factors,'' the transition of power would go on and that the ``tensions and difficulties that exist in this society will be removed.'' The United States and the European Union have rushed to give their support to the new leader, offering Yugoslavia a chance to end international isolation imposed during the Balkan wars of the past decade. In Washington, Clinton said Thursday he had directed the immediate lifting of an oil embargo and a flight ban to Yugoslavia, part of a package of sanctions imposed in 1998. ``The victory of freedom in Serbia is one of the most hopeful developments in Europe since the fall of the Berlin Wall,'' he said. ``It ended a dictatorship and it can liberate an entire region from the nagging fear that ethnic differences can again be exploited to start wars and shift borders.'' Clinton's adviser on the Balkans, James O'Brien, was to meet Thursday with Kostunica, in an apparent renewal of ties severed during last year's NATO bombing of Yugoslavia. The U.S. military played a key role in the campaign aimed at forcing Milosevic to end a crackdown on independence-minded ethnic Albanians in the Yugoslav province of Kosovo. Since the airstrikes, the U.S. Embassy and a cultural center were trashed and sprayed with anti-American graffiti. There have been no diplomatic relations between the two countries since the bombing began in March 1999.

thanks for joining us. here's our top story -- the pentagon says it believes the explosion that damaged the u.s. navy destroyer "cole" was a suicide terrorist attack by two men in a small boat. it happened today as the 505-foot long ship was docked for refueling in the port of aden, yemen. the pentagon says the small boat pulled alongside the "cole" and the two men on board stood at attention as the boat exploded. four sailors were killed, 35 were injured, and as many as a dozen are missing. the navy has flown medical personnel from bahrain to aden to help care for the wounded. fbi agents are en route to the scene to gather evidence. this is file video of the ship you're seeing right now. the explosion blew a 20-to-40-foot hole on the port side of the ship's hull. flooding has been contained on board, but the destroyer is listing four degrees. all other ships of the fifth fleet have been ordered out to sea and placed on a higher state of alert. president clinton told a gathering today he is taking steps for those responsible for the attack on the "uss cole." if, as it now appears this was an act of terrorism, it was a despicable and cowardly act. we will find out who is responsible and hold them accountable. if their intention was to deter us from our mission of promoting peace and security in the middle east, they will fail utterly. the families of the victims are being notified.

The Nobel prize in literature was awarded Thursday to Gao Xingjian, the exiled Chinese writer who is best known for daring plays that combine a modernist sensibility with traditional elements from Chinese drama, and whose work was banned after he wrote a play set against the backdrop of the Tiananmen Square massacre. In making the award to Gao, 60, the Swedish Academy in Stockholm said he had produced a body of work of universal validity, bitter insights and linguistic ingenuity that has opened new paths for the Chinese novel and drama. Gao Xingjian (pronounced gow shing-jen) has lived in a suburb of Paris since 1987 and is also an artist whose paintings have been exhibited around the world. He is the first Chinese writer to win the Nobel literature award, which this year carries a prize of about $900,000. Gao, who spent Thursday answering a constantly ringing telephone in his small apartment in Bagnolet, east of Paris, said he was astonished to hear of the award when told during a two-minute call from Stockholm. ``They announced it to me very simply and told me I had to prepare a 45-minute speech,'' he told Reuters Television, speaking in French. ``I said, `That's very long.''' Of his novels, the best known is ``Soul Mountain,'' a long, impressionistic work that arose from a 10-month walking tour Gao took along the Yangtze River in 1986 following a period of increasing harassment from the Chinese authorities over the content of his plays. The book is a hodgepodge of literary styles and techniques, with a variety of narrators and interwoven tales of people Gao met on his journey: monks, folk singers, village elders, victims of the Cultural Revolution and the like. And, in a thoroughly modernist touch, it is highly self-conscious about its own techniques. At one point, the narrator criticizes the author, saying, ``You've slapped together travel notes, moralistic ramblings, feelings, notes, jottings, untheoretical discussions, unfable-like fables, copied out some folk songs, added some legend-like nonsense of your own, and are calling it fiction!'' Born in 1940 in Jiangxi province in eastern China, Gao earned a degree in French in Beijing and embarked on a life of letters. During the Cultural Revolution, he was sent to a re-education camp, where he spent six years at hard labor in the fields. He also burned a suitcase full of his early manuscripts, including novels, plays and articles on aesthetics. He was first able to publish his work in 1979 and to travel abroad. During the 1980s, when he worked as the resident playwright at the Beijing Peoples Art Theaters, he produced a prolific stream of short stories, plays, essays and books. Many of them attracted the unwelcome attention of the authorities, including an essay on aesthetics that challenged the social realism espoused by Mao Zedong, and ``Bus Stop,'' a 1983 play with strong Beckettian influences, which was condemned as intellectual pollution. He left China in 1987, settled in Paris a year later as a political refugee and renounced his Communist Party membership after the Tiananmen Square massacre. Shortly afterwards, he was declared persona non grata in China. None of his plays have been performed there since.

Celebrating the political rebirth of the people of Serbia, President Clinton lifted key trade and economic sanctions to demonstrate support for Belgrade's newly installed government. ``The victory of freedom in Serbia is one of the most hopeful developments in Europe since the fall of the Berlin Wall,'' the president said on Friday. ``It ended a dictatorship and it can liberate an entire region from the nagging fear that ethnic differences can again be exploited to start wars and shift borders.'' Clinton announced the immediate ending of the oil embargo and flight ban that were imposed in 1998 to punish and isolate the regime of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic. ``The removal of these sanctions is a first step to ending Serbia's isolation,'' Clinton said in a written statement. James C. O'Brien, the senior U.S. official overseeing developments in the Balkans, met with new Yugoslav President Vojislav Kostunica in Belgrade on Thursday to offer congratulations on Kostunica's election victory and to highlight the message that further progress is expected. Clinton acted just days after the European Union lifted its own oil embargo and ban on commercial flights to and from Serbia, the principal Yugoslav republic. ``We have a strong interest in supporting Yugoslavia's newly elected leaders as they work to build a truly democratic society,'' Clinton said. The EU did not remove sanctions that froze overseas assets of Milosevic and his allies and prohibited them from traveling to 15 EU nations. Clinton said the United States would also ensure that the lifting of sanctions does not allow Milosevic's supporters ``to continue the systematic theft of resources that have marked the last 13 years.'' ``Our disagreement was with the Milosevic regime, not the people of Serbia who have suffered under the regime's brutal policies,'' the president said. ``In that vein we will continue to enforce a ban on travel to the United States by top members of the Milosevic regime and keep in place measures that help the new government deter a looting of the national patrimony during the current period of transition in Yugoslavia,'' the president said. He said the administration also would review restrictions on Serbia's participation in international financial institutions ``as Serbia makes its democratic transition and meets its international obligations.'' ``There is still much work ahead for the Yugoslav people and their new government: restoring confidence in the rule of law, rebuilding an honest economy, accounting for the past while building for a better future,'' Clinton said. ``Thankfully, that work can now begin _ without the burden of isolation and with the friendship of the American people.''

An apparent suicide terrorist bombing tore into a U.S. Navy destroyer Thursday, killing four Americans, injuring three dozen and leaving 12 missing, the Defense Department said. Authorities said the explosion was triggered by a small boat that had pulled alongside the ship as it was docked in the Arabian Peninsula. President Clinton said the attack on the USS Cole appeared to be an act of terrorism. ``We will find out who was responsible and hold them accountable,'' he pledged. No one has claimed responsibility for the attack, U.S. officials said. Calling the attack a ``despicable and cowardly act,'' Clinton told reporters at the White House that he had ordered all Navy ships in the region to pull out of port as a safety precaution and a heightened state of alert at U.S. military bases. He had a message for those responsible for the attack: ``If their intention was to deter us from our mission of promoting peace and security in the Middle East, they will fail utterly.'' The president said he had dispatched investigators from the State Department, the Pentagon and the FBI to Yemen. He said Yemen had pledged its cooperation.

President Clinton urged Israelis and Palestinians to undertake an immediate cease-fire after a new outbreak of bloodshed and called on both sides to condemn all acts of violence. ``Now is the time to stop the bloodshed, to restore calm, to return to dialogue and ultimately to the peace process,'' the president said Thursday afternoon in the White House Rose Garden. The president spoke after a Palestinian mob killed two Israeli soldiers in the West Bank town of Ramallah, and Israel retaliated with a rocket attack on Yasser Arafat's residential compound, Palestinian police stations and broadcasting centers. ``I strongly condemn the murder of Israeli soldiers in Ramallah today,'' the president said. ``While I understand the anguish Palestinians feel over the losses they have suffered, there can be no possible justification for mob violence.'' The two soldiers were the latest casualties of two weeks of violence that has left more than 90 people dead. ``I call on both sides to undertake a cease-fire immediately, and immediately to condemn all acts of violence,'' Clinton said. The president went before television cameras after consulting with Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and National Security Adviser Sandy Berger. ``The alternative to the peace process is now no longer merely hypothetical,'' Clinton said. ``It is unfolding today before our very eyes.'' The Palestinian-Israeli violence was not the only crisis confronting Clinton. An apparent suicide bombing in the Middle East tore into a U.S. Navy destroyer Thursday, killing four Americans, injuring three dozen and leaving 12 missing, the Defense Department said. The attack occurred while the ship was docked in the Arabian Peninsula and was being refueled. ``If, as it now appears, this was an act of terrorism, it was a despicable and cowardly act,'' Clinton said. ``We will find out who was responsible and hold them accountable. If their intention was to deter us from our mission of promoting peace and security in the Middle East, they will fail, utterly.'' The twin crises erupted as the president was at his home in Chappaqua, N.Y., where he and his wife, Hillary, celebrated their 25th wedding anniversary. He returned to Washington late in the morning. Clinton talked by telephone with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat after the brutal killings of two Israeli soldiers by a Palestinian mob in the West Bank town of Ramallah. Arafat told Clinton that he, too, deplores the violence and that Palestinian police had tried to protect the Israeli soldiers, National Security Council spokesman P.J. Crowley said. Israeli helicopters bombed Arafat's residential compound in the Gaza Strip and targets in the West Bank in retaliation for the killings. Clinton was trying to reach Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak, and talked with British Prime Minister Tony Blair and U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan. ``We deplore all loss of life,'' Crowley said. ``We are greatly concerned that instances of this kind can easily escalate into something even more dangerous. The president understands how serious this situation is and we are doing everything in our power to prevent a further escalation.'' Shortly after 7 a.m., the president was alerted by national security adviser Sandy Berger about the explosion on the destroyer USS Cole during a refueling at Aden, Yemen. Authorities said a small craft came alongside the ship and an explosion followed. In addition to four dead, another 12 sailors were missing. ``Obviously given the circumstances, including the eyewitness accounts, we are investigating the possibility this was a terrorist attack,'' Crowley said. ``We have not reached that conclusion. But we are going to do everything in our power to learn what transpired here.'' He said the FBI was sending in agents, and the Pentagon was dispatching an anti-terrorism team from the region. ``I think we have to let the facts catch up with the conclusions that many have already drawn this morning,'' Crowley said when asked if it was a terrorist attack. ``What we know is there was a massive explosion aboard the ship. It had been in port only for a few hours. It was going through a refueling. But beyond that, we have to investigate it first.''

we begin with the attack on the "uss cole" with nbc's jim miklaszewski at the pentagon. jim, what's the latest there? tonight, the latest casualty figures are 6 dead, 11 missing and 36 wounded. but navy officials predict that death toll will surely rise in what is the worst terrorist attack against a u.s. navy ship in modern history. the gaping, blackened hole in the side of the "uss cole" is all the evidence the navy's top officer needs to declare this a terrorist attack. i have no reason to think that this was anything but a senseless act of terrorism. the destroyer, one of the most powerful ships in the u.s. navy, is on its way to the persian gulf when it stops at yemen to take on fuel. yemen is considered a high threat area. the crew is already on a heightened state of alert. so then, how did the attackers get so close? navy officials report the "cole" pulls up to an offshore pier in the middle of aden harbor, preparing to refuel. one of the small harbor boats, hired by the u.s. to help moor the destroyer, takes one of the ship's lines, ties it to a buoy, then returns. it's normally a routine operation, so no one aboard the "cole" has the slightest suspicion the ship is about to be attacked. two men aboard the small boat suddenly snap to attention as if following orders. then, the blast -- an enormous explosion that tears a huge gash in the side of the ship. seawater rushes through the 20 x 40-foot hole. the crew fights desperately to save the ship. they have performed superbly. they dispatch medical teams. the 11 miss rg presumed trapped. in congress tonight, outrage and a warning to those responsible. we will find you. we will punish you. and the price that we will exact will be far exceed anything you may have gained by inflicting this outrageous act of terrorism. how may i help you? a vigil for the dead and survivors. i talked to the two om buds man. they want to pass along to have everybody say a prayer. a new concern tonight. two navy ships are steaming to the area to provide security. because the "cole" is in a high-threat area, it is loaded with cruise missiles and sitting dead in the water. thanks , jim miklaszeski.

In worry and uncertainty, more than 100 spouses and children waited together through the day on Thursday at the Norfolk Naval Base for some official word on precisely who perished and who survived in the terrorist attack upon the destroyer Cole. ``There are some people very quiet, some people very upset, but everybody is just waiting,'' said Catherine M. Stokoe, director of the base's family service center, as the anxious vigil continued hours after the lethal attack. The Navy emphasized it was taking time to carefully prepare the casualty tally to avoid the release of painful misinformation. Thus, the family members waited together, not knowing who ultimately would be most stricken by the news of the tragedy in which at least four service members based here were killed. The base itself was tightly battened down to most visitors under what was described as a ``Threat Con Alpha'' state of heightened security. Navy officials said this extra level of caution was ordered for all coastal bases after the Cole was attacked. ``Oh Lord, this is going to bring on a lot of fear around here,'' said Catherine Thompson, a 31-year-old mother of four whose husband, Michael, is about to ship out for the Middle East as a cook aboard the aircraft carrier Harry S. Truman. ``Just his going away can scare you, depress you,'' said Catherine Thompson, speaking on a street of suburban quietude lined with new off-post homes. ``But this terrible thing makes you think it's like going to war.'' Across the street, Sylvester Robinson, a Navy man assigned to guard duty at the base brig in the final months of his 20-year career, warily tracked the tragedy at mid-day as he polished his car. ``They're still looking for 12 others,'' he said. ``This is upsetting. I mean, it could be someone I know here in the community. This story is not complete on that and on who is responsible. It can get people hysterical.'' By all accounts, the large Navy community long rooted in this Hampton Roads hub instantly began rallying around family members of the crew as soon as the Cole was identified in morning news bulletins. ``We're Navy and it's hard for an outsider to see, but this community comes together at a moment like this,'' said Carlton Burch, a retired sailor. He and his friend John Van Ness, another Navy veteran, debated from experience the relative security risks of being in port or on the high seas in the course of Middle East duty. ``I don't know, but in port, on liberty, there always seemed a chance to get up close,'' Burch said as the two waited as volunteers at the Christian Service Center on Hampton Blvd., a drop-in spiritual shelter for visiting military personnel. ``Yeah, but out at sea you had to be alert for aircraft and missiles over there,'' said Van Ness, who was reminded by the Cole attack of one of his old Navy jobs, notifying the next of kin when a service member died. ``Imagine what it's like over there,'' he said, peering across the boulevard toward the tightly secured base. The rotation of Navy crews to and from their world deployments is a seasonal spectacle here. Crew members bound ashore to families waiting on the piers while others bid goodbye in sadder tableaux. Word of the Cole tragedy came as community leaders were preparing for the annual Fleet Week celebrations. They were to begin this weekend with the dedication here in Town Point Park of a 7-foot sculpture, ``The Homecoming.'' It depicts a young family exulting at being re-united after a long tour of sea duty, the sailor and his wife hugging tightly and their small son, in turn, embracing them both. The outward signs of Navy-town routine were largely unchanged as residents tracked the frightening news through the day. Shoppers packed the post retail exchanges; golfers practiced shots on a driving range bordering the base. But at one point, dock visitors could see a destroyer flag quietly lowered to half staff in honor of lost mates on the Cole. Outside the tightly secured base, a score of TV news antenna trucks remained on the prowl, awaiting word on the casualties and their families. ``We're seeing a lot of sad people around here,'' said Michelle Carr at the Triple A car insurance agency which serves Navy families. ``Wives are getting their husbands ready to go out on deployment next month, and now they have to deal with this.'' Thompson, one of those wives, firmly emphasized one saving grace, seen in the resilience of her friends who are Navy wives, the professional counselors always ready to help stricken base families, or the extensive e-mail network that allows families to communicate directly with relatives at sea. ``This community is Navy,'' she said. ``The Navy is always there for us.''

An apparent attack on a US warship has left at least six American sailors dead and about 35 injured. The explosion came as the guided-missile destroyer USS Cole was refueling at a port in Yemen. NPR's Chad Pergram reports. Both the White House and the Pentagon said the attack appeared to be an act of terrorism. President Clinton immediately whisked to the region investigative teams from the FBI, the Pentagon and the State Department. The attack comes as US forces in the Middle East have been placed on a heightened state of alert after days of clashes between Israelis and Palestinians. Defense Secretary William Cohen said the US would continue to protect its interests around the globe. No one should doubt our resolve to remain a force for peace and for stability and no one should assume that they can force us to retreat. No one should assume they can attack us with impunity. The Cole had just arrived in the harbor for a refueling stop. Officials say men aboard this small boat had been assisting the Cole with mooring lines just before the blast.

In what may have been a ripple effect of the Middle East crisis, an explosion today killed at least four sailors on a US Navy destroyer in the Yemeni port of Aden. American investigators are going to the scene but in Washington at the White House, the Pentagon and the State Department, US officials are already expressing suspicions that today's explosion was an act of terrorism. The World's Clark Boyd reports. The blast, which occurred just after noon local time in Yemen, ripped a 20 x 40 foot gash in the USS Cole, a state-of-the art destroyer that had stopped in Aden to refuel before joining the carrier George Washington in the Persian Gulf. Speaking at the Cole's home base in Norfolk, Virginia, Admiral John Foley said that the navy is investigating the incident. I don't know whether it was terrorism or not. It was an act of certainly a severe belligerence but we don't know the source, nor can I comment any further on that. But in Washington, Pentagon officials went further saying that they had every reason to suspect that the blast was caused by terrorists. The officials said that reports from the scene, including one from an army officer working in Aden harbor, suggested that a small rubber craft that was helping the Cole dock came alongside the destroyer and caused the blast. Many, including retired Admiral Eugene Carroll, are suspicious that the small boat may have been loaded with high-power explosives and that the attack was planned. That craft that approached the Cole is a rubber boat, not a big craft, but they would have had to pack it fully with explosives to do the amount of damage that they did to the Cole and that certainly would have taken time to get that put together. While both the Pentagon and the Justice Department today dispatched teams of experts to Yemen to investigate the explosion, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright urged caution saying it was too early to jump to any conclusions. Still, she promised that the United States would take appropriate action if terrorists were found to be behind the blast, a sentiment echoed later in the day by President Clinton. If, as it now appears, this was an act of terrorism, it was a despicable and cowardly act. We will find out who is responsible and hold them accountable. If their intention was to deter us from our mission of promoting peace and security in the Middle East, they will fail utterly. For some terrorism experts today's attack, which occurred against the backdrop of intense clashes between Palestinians and Israelis in the Middle East, has an eerily familiar ring to it. Bruce Hoffman is the Director of the Rand Corporation's Washington office. We have seen often in the past how violence and conflict and tensions in the Middle East often embroil the United States, one only has to recall the bombing of the US Marine barracks in Lebanon in 1983. Also a month before Presidential election, also at a time when Israel was involving suitable ferment at that point in Lebanon now with the Palestinians, where the United States was also attempting actively to provide some stabilizing influence and unfortunately and tragically got caught up in the maelstrom and that seems to be the salient fact of this attack. And if this attack turns out to be the work of terrorists, Hoffman says it would signal a dangerous new trend. Maritime or marine-borne terrorist attacks are actually quite rare. That being said it could well be the beginning of a new pattern. We have made it far more difficult, appropriately so, for terrorists to attack our ground forces in the Arabian Peninsula. So, I think terrorists prevented from attacking their targets using their more conventional means 'truck bombs' have merely adjusted their tactics slightly and obviously they have been successful with it today. On Yemeni TV today the country's President expressed his heart-felt condolences to those who were killed and injured, but denied that the explosion on board the Cole was caused by terrorists. Although, admits Mohammed al-Qadhi, editor of the Yemen Observer newspaper in the capital Sana, anti-American sentiment has been running high in Yemen because of events in the Middle East. The people now in the streets are gathering because they feel that not just as Arabs, as human beings, that what is happening in Palestine is not humanitarian. Regarding the United States attitude in this regard, we find that the United States until now are supporting Israel. The people here feel that United States should do something. With tensions running high throughout the Middle East, today's incident off the coast of Yemen serves as a warning. US armed forces and diplomatic personnel might be on high alert for sometime to come. For The World this is Clark Boyd.

Washington is starting to lift the economic sanctions it imposed on Yugoslavia, though some will remain in place. This report from the BBC's Johnny Diamond. President Clinton called Mr. Kostunica's victory one of the most hopeful developments in Europe since the fall of the Berlin Wall. He added that the removal of the sanctions was a first step to ending Serbia's isolation. Yugoslavia will have oil and air links restored. The administration is keen to reward the Yugoslav people for their removal of Mr. Milosevic, but some important sanctions remain. Also to remain intact are measures designed to stop Mr. Milosevic and his allies from siphoning money into banks outside Yugoslavia. Johnny Diamond, BBC News for The World.

the u.s. navy has, as of tonight, 101 ships at sea in the water. one of them is dead in the water tonight, its first deck flooded by a 20 foot by 40-foot hole, a bomb having blown a hole in the side of the hull. it is the destroyer u.s.s. cole. we are joined now by the military commander of the persian gulf war, retired general h. norman schwarzkopf. general, good evening to you. good to see you again. good evening, brian. the ship was, after all, headed to persian gulf duty, something you're very familiar with. do you regard this as a wake-up call to all americans, all american servicemen and women that this is still a very dangerous area of the world? well, i think we need to remind ourselves, you have the towers not too long ago that killed an awful lot of airmen. you had beirut, which killed marines, and now you have this incident. what does it all add up to you? well, it just adds up to the fact that there are people out there who hate the united states of the america, who have vowed to do something about it, and are completely capable of a major, destructive act. in our last hour, the general admitted it's nothing less than human nature to get complacent. this was a mission like any other refueling stop this ship has ever done since it had its maiden voyage. and yet security was heightened. there was a certain level of terrorist alert, and yet this still happened. yeah, i really -- you know, i guess you could say that the smartest thing that could have been done was not go there in the first place. but having said that, the fact that they were only going to be there for four hours, the fact that they did have sailors on alert with weapons along the side of the ship, i've got to tell you, you can just imagine when the sailors were there and all of a sudden that small boat turned straight ahead to the destroyer, somebody had to make a decision to open fire if they really thought it was that kind of threat, and that's a very tough decision for a young sailor to make. a tough decision, and it's been pointed out these local tenders are absolutely vital. you can't stop, dock and refuel, tie it up to the buoys without them. and the boats themselves, even the faces on the men sometimes become familiar, and they have apparently, the terrorists, if the scenario is to be believed, apparently infiltrated the ranks of the port authority boat pilots there, so they might have been familiar to the men and women on the ship. yeah, well, you know, the government was just informed 10 or 12 days ago that the ship was coming in. other than that, nobody was informed of it, so obviously there was a leak from the government somewhere that brought this about. and oh, by the way, not only are the tenders familiar, but there's a lot of them in ports. there always are. how -- do you concur with the assessment of the one senior official we quoted not long ago in the broadcast, this was perhaps the best prepared, best laid-out terrorist attack we've ever seen? well, you know, it's hard to compare the planning and how well something was laid out. obviously they were waiting for us, given the limited amount of time the ship was going to be there, so obviously they were waiting for the ship to come in. there's been a lot of other terrible terrorist activities. beirut, bombing for one, which is probably the worst of all, so i wouldn't say this is the best of anything. it's just one of the worst. general, how do you go about -- let's say the terrorist cell is isolated in the next few days and we get some positive evidence about who's responsible for this. what kind of calculus goes into deciding the right response militarily? well, that's a good question. you know, a great deal -- first of all, it's very, very tough in a short time span to figure out who did this sort of thing. there's going to be a lot of groups claiming credit for it. whether they did it or not is another question entirely, and then once you pin down who did it, the question is where are they located? are they in a country that's friendly to us? are they in a country that's an enemy of ours snow how do we get to them? are they isolated? if they are, what's the best way to get at them? is it an air strike or special forces operation over the ground? you lit tale have to, number one, figure out who did it, then number two, where they are, number three, how vulnerable they are, and then, number four, what's the best course of action to take. it's not easy. and that fourth choice can be the most grim. do you take out some sort of asset, a piece of real estate, a ship, a plane, or do you intentionally go about taking lives? i think that the truth of the matter is anything short of a direct attack on their lives is not going to make very much difference to them whatsoever. all it will do, if you take out some facility, you know, that belongs to another government, that just gives them one more reason to go after you. norman schwarzkopf, thank you very much for being with us tonight. good to see you again. nice to see you, brian.

there is late word tonight that a local yemeni group is now publicly claiming responsibility for the attack on the u.s.s. cole that so far has killed at least six sailors. u.s. investigators are looking into the claim, and they caution this kind of thing happens. there may be several more claims in the next couple of days, but already several prime suspects may be emerging as well. nbc news correspondent andrea mitchell has the latest. tonight, the question for u.s. terrorist hunters -- who could have pulled off such a well-timed attack? intelligence officials tell nbc news this may be an inside job. planned for six months or longer, with informers from yemen's government or the port, alerting terrorists to the cole's refueling schedule. if, as it now appears, this was an act of terrorism, it was a despicable and cowardly act. we will find out who was responsible and hold them accountable. but how to find the terrorists? f.b.i. investigators on the scene already look for clues. we're conducting a joint forensic investigation of the explosion as we do in all of these cases in a very detailed, methodical and professional manner, and we should have concrete results shortly. officials say no specific warning of today's bombing, but a few days ago, intelligence that something might happen in yemen. officials say a dangerous country until 10 years ago on the u.s. list of terrorists nations. but this year, its president visits the white house. still, the state department says terror groups roam freely there. who are the suspects? no one knows. but first, osama bin laden sent terrorist training trainers to yemen, but officials say no evidence yet he is involved. second, the egyptian islamic jihad killed terrorists in 1997, loosely assigned with bin laden. or u.s. officials say hezbollah, blew up the marine baraks in lebanon in 1983. only last week kidnapped three israeli soldiers. or hamas, responsible for suicide bombings in israel. and also the jihad. certainly it's an attack that required some planning. it wasn't laid on overnight. what is the motive? experts say it could be anger at the u.s. over recent violence in the middle east. if the suspects are identified, what will the u.s. do next? i would certainly hope that we will retaliate if we have good intelligence as to where this came from. last time there was a terror attack against the u.s., the embassy bombings in africa two years ago, the president did retaliate, even though critics said there was sketchy evidence. but still, officials say if he finds the culprits this time, he will do the same thing again. andrea mitchell, nbc news, washington. we are joined now by former c.i.a. director james woolsey, with us from our washington bureau tonight. mr. woolsey, i'd like to start you off where you'd like to begin on this, perhaps the threat of terrorism in yemen, perhaps the claim of responsibility tonight. yemen is a lawless place, and most any of the groups that andrea mitchell talked about could have been involved, but there's another that we ought to consider, which is the possibility that there is some government activity behind this. for example, from iraq. the lead f.b.i. agent, now unfortunately deceased in new york city for the world trade center investigation, who ran the investigation up there, always thought that saddam hussein was behind the world trade center operation. and so there's a real propensity for terrorist groups or governments behind terrorist operations to run so-called false flag operations where there's deception as to who is involved. and i think we need to keep an open mind. this may be one of these quasi independent terrorist organizations, but conceivably there could be a government back there somewhere. mr. woolsey, i don't know how much was spent on u.s. intelligence last year. i know it's a lot of money, and i know a lot of that money was spent in the region we're talking about here tonight. how good are the united states' contacts? how much do we know? obviously in this case, not to be flipped, not enough. well, certainly not enough to have stopped this, and that's a great tragedy, especially for those who lost their lives with families. american intelligence in the mideast on the whole is pretty good, much of it derives from close working relationships with friendly intelligent services in the area and friendly states. some of the most high-tech intelligence is not directly relevant to something like this. for example, photo reconnaissance satellites or many types of communications intercepts, and those are the really expensive parts of american intelligence. penetrating terrorist groups, it kind of comes down to having spies, and that's hard and very difficult work in the region. and to the very nitty-gritty business of tracking a case, any case, it's awfully nice when you can get someone very basically at the street level to tell. how often does that happen in that region? it happens from time to time, but the c.i.a. has operated for a few years under some restrictions, some guidelines that discourage. they don't prevent. but they do discourage the recruitment inside terrorist organizations of people, for example, who may have been guilty of human rights violations in the past. well, you know, if you're recruiting someone inside a government, often you get a good person inside a bad government that's willing to work for the united states, because they're had sympathetic with democracy. but if you're talking about being inside a terrorist group, the only people in there are terrorists, so you're going to have to pay money or otherwise do something to get information from some pretty unsavory people if you want to be successful. do you agree that it doesn't too long, months, years, of easy military operations in the red sea through the canal to breed complacency, no matter what the terrorist threat may be? it's possible, but i was once undersecretary of the navy, and listening to what was going on here, they were only going to be in port for four hours. sailors were armed and standing there ready to shoot if something suspicious happened. but this was a tug apparently that was part of the docking operation for the fueling. and it would have been very, very difficult, even with good intelligence and even with very alert people to have stopped something like this. former director of central intelligence james woolsey, thank you very much for being with us tonight.

The United States has lifted some of the economic sanctions it imposed on Yugoslavia two years ago. As VOA's Eve Cornet reports from Belgrade, a US special envoy gave the news to President Vojislav Kostunica. Balkan's Advisor James O'Brien and President Kostunica met for the first top-level talks between the United States and Yugoslavia, since the break of diplomatic relations on the eve of NATO air strikes in 1999. President Kostunica said he was ready for dialogue with the West, but stressed that territorial accords reached with international negotiators in the Balkans should be respected. Balkan's envoy O'Brian stressed that the US would begin lifting sanctions against Yugoslavia and that only technical issues remain an obstacle to reestablishing relations. However, key sanctions which directly target ousted Yugoslav leader Slobodan Milosevic and his allies remain in place. Meanwhile, parties in Slobodan Milosevic's Socialist coalition are making it clear they plan to hold onto control of the Serbian government, despite calls for new elections.

The Voice of America presents differing points of view on a wide variety of issues. Next an editorial expressing the policies of the United States government. A new day has dawned in Yugoslavia, following last week's massive street demonstrations and the sudden collapse of the repressive regime of Slobodan Milosevic. The democratically elected President of Yugoslavia, Vojislav Kostunica is now moving to secure control over the country. An agreement is being worked out to call for new parliamentary elections to allow the Serbian people to move to a democratic government on the Republic level, as well as on the Federal level. President Bill Clinton called Mr. Kostunica's election an extraordinary victory for the people of Yugoslavia, who endured oppression and deprivation, who saw through the propaganda, who took their country back with nothing but courage, principle, and patriotism. Mr. Clinton directed that immediate steps to be taken to lift United States trade and financial sanctions on Yugoslavia, except those targeted against members of the former regime. This includes lifting the oil embargo and flight ban, effective immediately. The European Union has already voted to lift all sanctions imposed on Yugoslavia since 1998, except the provisions affecting Milosevic and his associates. The EU also pledged to contribute 2 billion dollars in aid to help rebuild the country. With the defeat of Milosevic, a dark cloud over South Eastern Europe has lifted. As long as Milosevic was in power, the danger of violence in Bosnia, Kosovo, Montenegro and Macedonia remained high. Today, the prospects for stability in the Balkans have . The US and its European allies intend to stay engaged in Yugoslavia and support the people who have own their freedom. Now is the time to build the economic and civil institutions that will allow democracy to endure.

Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush each demanded Thursday that anyone who attacked an American Navy destroyer in Yemen be held accountable, as intensifying conflict in Israel and the Palestinian lands placed foreign policy at the center of the presidential race. The candidates, in separate campaign appearances, also called for Yasser Arafat to take a lead in ending the cycle of violence, which accelerated Thursday when Israeli helicopters struck Palestinian targets in retaliation for the killing of two Israeli soldiers on the West Bank. Gore canceled several interviews to return to Washington and Bush said it was a moment when America's leaders should ``speak with one voice.'' Gore said the Palestinian leader, Arafat, should ``issue instructions to those who have been perpetrating this violence to case and desist,'' adding, ``It is a time to start building again on the relative progress of the previous two days _ and that can still be done _ to end the violence and damp down the tensions'' in order to restart the Middle East peace process. Bush, the Republican nominee, put his support behind the Clinton administration. ``It's time for our nation to speak with one voice,'' he told reporters in Winston-Salem, N.C. ``I appreciate the administration's efforts to bring calm to that troubled part of the world.'' He said Arafat ``must stand up and call upon the people he represents to put down their rocks and arms.'' ``It's time for him to be a statesman,'' Bush added. With less than four weeks left before Election Day, the presidential race seems to be closest in decades, and international affairs have generally been on the back burner during a time marked by prosperity. But the second presidential debate, on Tuesday night, focused largely on foreign policy. And Thursday's violence in Israel and the Palestinian lands and the attack on the Navy warship in Yemen put international affairs at center stage. In their debate, Bush and Gore to a large extent agreed on the nation's approach to the Middle East and the Balkans but differed over when they would commit troops overseas and what kinds of crises they would deem threats to national interests. Thursday, they almost echoed each other's words. Bush said he was ``saddened and angered'' by the attack in Yemen and added: ``I hope that we gather enough intelligence to figure out who did the act and take the necessary action. There must be a consequence.'' Asked later in an interview with Fox News whether the consequences should include American military strikes, he said he wanted more information but thought the United States should send a ``swift, sure and a clear signal to terrorists around the world that we are not going to tolerate terrorism.'' He called for a moment of silence for the sailors before a speech in Langhorne, Pa. Gore also began a campaign event at a packed Milwaukee park by asking the crowd ``for a moment of silence and prayer'' for the American sailors who were killed. He drew cheers when he promised retaliation if the sailors had been victims of a terrorist attack, and declared, ``We will defend our country and we will defend our democracy.'' He told reporters, ``If it is determined to be the result of a terrorist operation, those responsible should know that the United States will not rest until the perpetrators are held accountable.'' Over the summer, Bush received the traditional intelligence briefing given by the Central Intelligence Agency to presidential nominees. A White House official said that Clinton's national security adviser, Samuel Berger, spoke Thursday to Bush's chief foreign policy adviser, Condoleezza Rice, on the day's events.

Thursday was supposed to be a day of foreign policy highs for President Clinton. He was rolling back sanctions against Yugoslavia, where democracy has sprouted anew, and revealing the prospect of a historic visit to North Korea. But those glowing feats fell victim to sad foreign policy events: A deadly attack on a Navy destroyer docked in Yemen and intensified violence in the Middle East that even Clinton said is melting the prospects for peace ``before our very eyes.'' Just two days earlier, the White House basked in the glow of history. Clinton met with Jo Myong Rok, special envoy for North Korean leader Kim Jong Il, to discuss, among other things, what North Korea could do to be removed from the list of state sponsors of terrorism. Before Jo's visit ended, a joint U.S.-North Korean communique revealed that Clinton is considering becoming the first U.S. president to visit the reclusive communist nation _ something seen as inconceivable just weeks ago. After a day of fund-raising speeches in Pennsylvania, Clinton looked tranquil and happy Wednesday night as he stepped off of Air Force One, shopping bag from Tiffany &AMP; Co., in hand, heading home to Chappaqua, N.Y. so he and first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton could celebrate their 25th wedding anniversary. Clinton had loose plans to return to Washington early Thursday, announce that he was lifting an oil embargo and a flight ban against Yugoslavia, then spend the morning playing golf. Aides prepared press releases trumpeting the sanctions removal as ``a first step toward ending Serbia's isolation.'' Instead, the president was awakened early Thursday by his national security adviser with news that a small boat had exploded beside the USS Cole as it docked in the Arabian Peninsula; Some sailors were dead, a dozen were missing. Then came word that two Israeli soldiers were killed by a Palestinian mob, and Israeli helicopters had fired rockets at Yasser Arafat's residential compound in retaliation. ``The president obviously was horrified,'' said White House spokesman Jake Siewert. Clinton called Defense Secretary William Cohen about the ship attack, then launched a round of phone calls to Arafat, British Prime Minister Tony Blair, United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak. Grim-faced, Clinton rushed to the airport for the short flight back to Washington, then went directly to the White House for national security briefings. About two hours later, he appeared in the White House Rose Garden, appealing for a cease-fire in Israel and decrying the ``act of terrorism'' against the USS Cole. ``If their intention was to deter us from our mission of promoting peace and security in the Middle East, they will fail, utterly,'' Clinton said. However, he admitted, ``The alternative to the peace process is now no longer merely hypothetical. It is unfolding today before our very eyes.'' With that, Clinton went back to work in the Oval Office. He never mentioned Yugoslavia or North Korea.

CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ U.S. embassies in the Middle East were assessing security Thursday following an apparent terrorist attack on a U.S. Navy 5th Fleet destroyer that killed at least five sailors and injured dozens of others. The U.S. Embassy in Yemen sent a message to American residents informing them of the explosion Thursday at the port of Aden and urging them to maintain a ``high level of vigilance,'' said Chris Eccel, an embassy spokesman. No one claimed responsibility for the explosion, which came amid anti-U.S. sentiment in the region over a perceived U.S. slant toward Israel in clashes with Palestinians. In Washington, U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno said officials were discussing issuing a worldwide terrorist alert at U.S. installations. The U.S. Embassy in Bahrain, where 1,000 U.S. military personnel and the U.S. 5th Fleet are based, issued a similar message. Donna Winton, spokeswoman at the U.S. Embassy, said there haven't been any particular precautions taken because of the Yemen explosion. In Jordan, the U.S. Embassy warned its personnel and Americans to be vigilant over the two-day weekend starting Friday, the Muslim Sabbath. ``Due to continuing tensions in the region and the continued uncertainty of the security environment, the embassy is instructing embassy personnel not to make nonessential movements from their places of residence,'' the embassy said in a statement. It repeated State Department instructions to U.S. citizens to ``maintain a low profile, vary routes and times for all required travel, and treat mail from unfamiliar sources with suspicion.'' A senior security official said the embassy's message was a ``precautionary measure'' in case of demonstrations on Friday. Violent riots broke out last Friday close to the U.S. Embassy, where police fired tear gas to block angry protesters from reaching the U.S. mission. The protesters hurled stones at police, smashed shop windows and vandalized cars and phone booths. Last month, a Jordanian military court issued harsh sentences to 22 men convicted of planning terrorist attacks on U.S. and Israeli targets in the kingdom. In Damascus, the U.S. Embassy refused to comment on security precautions, but spokesman Steve Seche said embassy personnel were following the situation. ___ On the Net, http://travel.state.gov

In the countdown to this year's Nobel Peace Prize, something strange is missing _ heated speculation about it. ``Seldom has the award been so open,'' said one television station in Oslo, where the award was to be announced on Friday. What little guessing there has been focuses on South Korean President Kim Dae-jung, the United Nations, or Finland's former President Martti Ahtisaari. Oslo's TV-2 asked viewers on its Internet site to vote on a candidate. The overwhelming favorite was the Salvation Army, a perennial nominee, which garnered more than 47 percent of the vote. Norway's news media traditionally make a game of trying to pick the winner, and often, they guess right. Yet the nation's major newspapers and broadcast media didn't even try Thursday, indicating they have little clue. By contrast, last year's winner, the humanitarian group Doctors Without Borders, figured heavily in guesses ahead of the announcement. The five-member committee and its nonvoting secretary Geir Lundestad stake their pride in keeping the secret. The Nobel committee never reveals the nominees, only their number. This year, a record 150 nominees, including 35 organizations, are in the running. Those making nominations for the prize, which includes a $915,000 cash award, often announce them. This year's nominees include President Clinton and former President Jimmy Carter for their peace efforts around the world, former U.S. Sen. George Mitchell for his work in Northern Ireland and former Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin for his Balkan peace efforts. Ahtisaari also was nominated for his efforts in the Balkans. Among the 35 organizations are the United Nations and several of its agencies, the Salvation Army, Human Rights Watch and the Italian Catholic group St. Egidio for nurturing good relations among religions, and the Russian anti-war group Soldiers' Mothers Committee. For the first time a whole town, northern Albania's Kukes, was nominated. Sometimes world events make a prize seem obvious, such as the 1990 prize to then-Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev as he helped bring the Cold War to an end. Nominations must be made before Feb. 1, which can result in an event at the top of the international agenda being too late for that year's prize. That could be the case this year for the democratic breakthrough in Yugoslavia, although two mediators in the Balkan conflict _ Ahtisaari and Chernomyrdin _ were nominated in time. The Balkans _ site of Europe's worst conflicts since World War II _ have been absent from recent prizes. The prize often is used to boost an ongoing process. The 1998 prize, for example, was related to an apparent breakthrough in the Northern Ireland conflict. That's partly why South Korea's president has emerged as a seeming hot prospect. He is seen as doing more to improve relations with North Korea in a few months than has happened in preceding decades. The United Nations has been suggested as a symbol of international cooperation in the new millennium. Iranian President Mohammad Khatami was mentioned for having promoted regional dialogue. The peace prize caps a week of Nobel announcements. The other prizes were announced in Stockholm, Sweden, this week. The prizes are presented on Dec. 10, the date the prize's founder, Swedish industrialist Alfred Nobel, died in 1896. The peace prize is the only one presented in Oslo. ___ On the Net: http://www.nobel.no

It only takes a little boat to make America, the Superpower, list symbolically in the water; merely a Saudi truck bomb, blasting a miniature moon crater, to humiliate as well as kill. Images of past humiliations are sharp, yet can run together in the mind. Gaping jagged holes and mountains of rubble, always the same shade of gray, are the common denominators of so many. The limp American flag hanging on a pole outside the car-bombed Beirut embassy in April 1983. The bombed Marine barracks in the same city six months later. Floors collapsed like an accordion at the Khobar Towers military housing compound in Saudi Arabia in 1996. Gray rubble everywhere. And, outside Khobar Towers, a bare footprint rendered in blood, each toe leaving a distinct mark from red blood turning brown. A U.S. ambassador in a blood-spattered green suit helped from a stairwell full of smoke and flying glass near the bombed embassy in Kenya in 1998. Each event measured precisely in lives lost but sized up in guesses as to what it means about America's place in the world. The presidential candidates were more prophetic than they could have wished to be when they sat down the other night and talked about how the United States is regarded. ``If we're an arrogant nation, they'll resent us,'' said George W. Bush. ``If we're a humble nation but strong, they'll welcome us.'' ``I agree with that,'' said Al Gore, his debating partner. ``I agree with that.'' ``We are so much more powerful than any single nation has been,'' the vice president went on. ``There is some resentment.'' Eight hours later, in the port of Aden, Yemen, some resentment or craziness or reason perhaps lost to the sea struck with terrible force. A boat that was helping moor the USS Cole turned against it, blowing a hole in the destroyer's gray steel hull amidships in what appeared to be a suicidal act of terrorism. The destroyer is sheathed in 70 tons of armor. The gray seawater poured in and made it list four degrees. America abroad is seen as strong, for sure. Arrogant, by many. Humble, not hardly. One episode of humility came out of the 1998 Nairobi bombing, when American and African cultures intermingled in the chaos. Prudence Bushnell, the injured ambassador, talked later about certain African qualities. ``I will never forget that, people behaved with such solidarity _ there was no individualism,'' she said. ``Very dense smoke, and we came to a standstill. Somebody yelled fire, but even then, there was no panic, no stampede.'' To some extent, every American abroad is a symbol and, therefore, vulnerable in certain places or circumstances. The State Department lists 27 countries that Americans should avoid _ Yemen not among them at this point _ and almost as many countries where Americans should take extra care. The affronts, indignities and attacks have not always come in predictable places or ways, as when a rocket-propelled grenade pierced the wall of the U.S. Embassy in Moscow in 1995. All of it has made America's symbols more of a fortress, at home and overseas. Big concrete planters hold flowers but are really there to stop suicide drivers or their ilk from getting close to the edifices of U.S. power. Rollerbladers make lazy circles now on Pennsylvania Avenue in front of the White House, where traffic is no longer allowed and barriers rise from the pavement beside gatehouses in the middle of what used to be a bustling street. ___ On the Web: State Department travel warnings and safety information by country: http://travel.state.gov/travel_warnings.html

Suspicion immediately centered on Osama bin Laden and the terrorism network he operates out of Afghanistan as U.S. experts probed the deadly attack on an American warship in Yemen. The United States accuses bin Laden of masterminding the bombings of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania two years ago that killed 224 people. His network is believed to extend to Yemen and other parts of the Middle East. President Clinton retaliated by bombing bin Laden camps in Afghanistan and a pharmaceutical factory in Sudan believed run by supporters of the expatriate Saudi. Clinton left no doubt Thursday that he again would strike a hard blow once a joint U.S.-Yemeni investigation determined who attacked the USS Cole on Thursday, killing or wounding dozens of sailors as it docked at the port of Aden. ``If, as it now appears, this was an act of terrorism, it was a despicable and cowardly act,'' the president said in the White House Rose Garden. ``We will find out who was responsible and hold them accountable.'' Known to operate in Yemen, as well, are two deadly groups: the Egyptian Islamic Jihad and the Islamic Army of Aden, whose leader, Zein al-Abidine al-Midhar was executed by firing squad two years ago in the hostage-taking of two Americans and 14 other Western tourists. The groups' militancy and location automatically make them suspects. Others under suspicion when terrorists strike include the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine and the Abu Nidal organization. Both have been relatively quiet lately. Hamas and the Iranian-backed Palestine Islamic Jihad group both have a presence in Yemen but are not known to have attacked Americans specifically. While weighing eyewitness accounts and the kind of explosive used in the attack, investigators are considering motivation and capability, the groups' track record and how far afield they tend to operate. Above all others, the bin Laden group is the one that comes to mind first in terms of method of operation and long-reach capability, said a U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity. According to Vincent Cannistraro, former chief of counterterrorism at the CIA, the attack was a suicide operation that only a handful of groups in the Middle East carry out _ Hezbollah, Hamas, the Palestinian Islamic Jihad and the bin Laden network. And, Cannistraro said in an interview, the only one of the four that has targeted Americans and has issued a fatwa, or religious edict, against Americans is the bin Laden group. ``He has access in Yemen, his father comes from southern Yemen and he has close ties with the Islamic Army of Aden, a militant group set up by bin Laden's brother, Muhammad Khalifa,'' the ex-CIA official said. Also, Cannistraro said, there are groups associated with bin Laden in Yemen that he funds and supports, and he has a camp inside the country. ``There are clear signs this was an inside job, and that those two suicide bombers were Yemeni themselves,'' he said. ``They carried high explosives. They had to be trained and prepared.'' Once the United States has convincing evidence, Cannistraro said, ``I suspect we will retaliate, but we have to find an address before we can bomb, and that's the hardest part.'' Steven Emerson, a terrorism expert, said the motive and capability point to an Islamic fundamentalist organization, one probably allied with bin Laden. And, Emerson said in an interview, ``we have to consider a Hezbollah connection'' because that militant group has a better vessel capability than any other one. ``There is only a finite number of suspects with the capability of carrying this out,'' Emerson said. Over the past two years in Yemen, he said, young British militant Muslims and local Yemeni Muslims have been training in terrorist camps. ``Next to Sudan and Iran,'' he said, ``Yemen has one of the highest concentrations of terrorist camps in the world.'' Yonah Alexander, director of the Washington-based International Center for Terrorism, suggested the Egyptian Islamic Jihad was a logical suspect. ``They do have the capability for maritime terrorism,'' he said. The group has fought in Egypt, Sudan and Afghanistan, ``and there is no question it is one of the major legs of the bin Laden organization,'' Alexander said in an interview. It is vehemently anti-American because of American support of Egypt and Israel, he said. Michael Sheehan, director of the State Department's counterterrorism office, stressed, however, that ``the U.S. government has not yet made a final determination about the incident and whether its cause was terrorism.''

For nearly eight years President Clinton has worked doggedly on one, consistent foreign policy goal: becoming the president who brought a widespread and enduring peace to the Middle East. Now after 15 days of spiraling, hate-filled and deadly violence between Israel and its Palestinian neighbors, those hopes appear smashed, leaving the president and his team scrambling to restore calm. ``This obviously was a bad day,'' a senior administration official said Thursday after Israeli helicopters fired missiles at Palestinian targets in the West Bank and Gaza in retaliation for the deaths of three Israeli soldiers. ``To think we that we can go from where we are right back into peace making isn't realistic. The wounds that exist on both sides are quite deep.'' ``I think there's growing concern that you have a situation that, if it continues this way, could, obviously spiral out of control,'' said the official, who briefed reporters on condition of anonymity. The president canceled the first day of a four-day country-spanning trip to stay at the White House and deal with the crisis. He scrapped speaking and fund-raising appearances scheduled for Friday in St. Louis, Kansas City, Mo., and Little Rock, Ark. White House officials said decisions would be made later on the remainder of the trip and its scheduled stops in Denver, Seattle, Portland, Ore., and Los Angeles. The day of crisis began when Palestinians stormed a jail in Ramallah and a mob beat three detained Israeli soldiers to death. Israel immediately fired rockets at the residential compound of Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat. For the United States the crisis was compounded with an apparent terrorist attack on a U.S. Navy destroyer, the USS Cole. ``If, as it now appears, this was an act of terrorism, it was a despicable and cowardly act,'' the president said, standing before cameras in the Rose Garden. ``We will find out who was responsible and hold them accountable.'' Clinton had hoped to begin and end the day on a high note. He had spent the night at his home at Chappaqua, N.Y., where he celebrated his 25th wedding anniversary with his wife, Hillary. He had planned a day of golf after highlighting two foreign policy high notes: the rolling back of sanctions in Yugoslavia where democracy has been given new life and the intriguing prospect of a historic trip to North Korea. At day's end Clinton and his team were trying to bridge a new gulf of enmity and grievance between Israelis and Palestinians and restore shattered communications and trust between the two sides. Working with Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and national security adviser Sandy Berger, Clinton talked repeatedly with Arafat, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, Jordan's King Abdullah, British Prime Minister Tony Blair and U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan. ``All the leaders share the president's concern that we have to ramp down the violence'' before it escalates further, said National Security Council spokesman P.J. Crowley. For the moment, the senior official acknowledged, ``the psychology of anger'' is the controlling force, a force he said must be subdued before more concrete steps at peace building can be attempted. This fact is all the more frustrating, he said, because as recently as 12 days ago ``all of us felt that the possibility of reaching agreement was quite real.'' Clinton has made Mideast peacemaking a foreign policy priority, only to meet repeated disappointments with the collapse of the Camp David summit, diplomatic failures and a resumption of violence. Clinton said the Israeli-Palestinian conflict ``is one of the greatest tragedies and most difficult problems of our time. But it can be solved.''

No fragments of a foreign submarine have been found near Russia's sunken nuclear submarine Kursk, and officials no longer consider a collision with another vessel the most likely cause of the tragedy, Russia's deputy prime minister said Friday. Investigators still haven't determined what caused an explosion that sent the Kursk crashing to the bottom of the Barents Sea during naval exercises Aug. 12. All 118 sailors aboard died. For months, Russian officials insisted that the most likely cause was a collision with a foreign submarine or ship. Other versions they considered were a collision with a World War II mine or a malfunction in the Kursk's torpedo department. None of the possibilities have been ruled out, but ``none of them is dominant'' any longer, Deputy Prime Minister Ilya Klebanov was quoted as saying by the Interfax news agency. Klebanov heads the government commission investigating the tragedy. Submersibles inspected a 60-square-mile area of the Barents Sea floor around the Kursk but found no pieces of a foreign submarine, Klebanov said. Russian rescuers tried for a week to get inside the Kursk, while officials insisted that at least some of the crew was still alive. But Klebanov said Friday that most of the sailors were killed in the seconds following the explosion _ confirming earlier conclusions by independent experts. ``By the time the vessel hit the bottom, almost all of the crew was already gone,'' he told reporters. An operation to retrieve the crew's remains is to begin late next week. But the submarine has been severely mangled, meaning that divers will not be able to reach many of the bodies, and those they do recover may be damaged by the explosion and subsequent corrosive sea water, Russian officials have said. Russian deep-water capsules have examined the Kursk and recorded ``catastrophic destruction,'' Klebanov said. ``It's just heaps of metal piled up, which would of course complicate the divers' work,'' he said.

hi. thank you for joining us this friday. we begin with the "uss cole" attack. investigators say there is increasing evidence terrorists were responsible for the explosion that killed as many as 17 sailors on the navy destroyer. ordnance experts have determined the blast came from an external source, most likely a small boat that pulled alongside the ship yesterday as it docked in a yemen port. divers who have examined the hull say the explosion left a hole 30 feet high and 40 feet wide. seven bodies have been recovered from the debris. ten sailors remain missing and are presumed dead. dozens of wounded survivors will be transported to hospitals in germany. the body ies of the victims are being brought back to the u.s. via germany after a stop at ramstein air base, they will be flown tomorrow to dell care. the military monday tans a mofrt wary facility at dover. the navy has released the names killed yesterday. they are -- surviving crew members are focusing their efforts on finding their comrades and keeping their ship seaworthy until it can be towed back to the u.s. they are very fatigued. they are working to find their missing shipmates. they are working and fighting for their ship and making sure that she is safe. and in fact, i'm happy to report that this morning things are stabilized. they have contained the flooding in all except the space that's open to the sea, in the hole that is visible in the pictures that have been shown to the public. so, an awful lot has gone on overnight.

ADEN, Yemen _ U.S. officials said Friday that 17 people were killed when a Navy destroyer refueling in Yemen was rocked by an explosion in an apparent terrorist attack on Thursday. There were 38 other sailors injured, some of them severely. The explosion came from one of several smaller harbor boats helping the destroyer Cole dock at a refueling station in this port, on the southern tip of the Arabian peninsula. Senior Pentagon officials said the boat, with at least two men aboard, had been loaded with explosives in what was evidently a well-planned suicide attack. Another bomb went off Friday morning in the British embassy compound in Sana, the Yemeni capital, but no one was hurt, said a British foreign office spokesman in London. Sana is about 200 miles from Aden, and there was no immediate evidence the two bombings were directly related. The bomb at the embassy was apparently hurled onto the grounds, and the British foreign office said a team of Scotland Yard investigators was being sent to investigate to determine if it was a terrorist attack. As dawn broke over Aden on Friday morning, the U.S. vessel could be seen from across the harbor, with a black hole in its side and sooty marks running up from the water. Sailors were active on the deck, and the first American investigators began arriving. The hole in the ship was later covered with a white tarpaulin. Later in the morning, more U.S. troops arrived in Yemen to provide security and additional medical help for the injured. In Norfolk, Va., Friday morning, Naval officials released the identities of the seven sailors whose bodies have been recovered as well as names of an additional 10 sailors officially listed as missing. An official said the Navy believes the missing were all killed in the blast, although the missing will continue to be listed as such until their deaths are officially confirmed. In Aden, the harbor area was tense and tightly sealed by army and police units of Yemen, many of them in camouflage. One officer said: ``The Americans are our friends. This is bad for Yemen.'' Two other U.S. Navy ships, including a destroyer, arrived Thursday in Aden to guard the Cole and help stabilize it. Pentagon officials said that some power and communication capabilities of the Cole had been restored. Britain and France also sent ships to Aden. Kenneth H. Bacon, the Pentagon spokesman, said that 38 sailors were injured in the attack, although five of the injured have returned to duty after receiving treatment for minor injuries. Officials evacuated 22 of the injured sailors to Germany aboard U.S. planes. Those sailors were to be treated at Landstuhl Regional Medical Center, a U.S. military hospital in Germany. Eleven other sailors were flown on French planes to Djibouti, in East Africa, for treatment. Bacon said those sailors will also be taken to Germany. The bodies of five of the sailors killed in the explosion arrived on Friday afternoon at Ramstein Air Base in Germany. Flag-draped coffins were carried from the aircraft to waiting hearses by an Air Force honor guard. The bodies will be brought back to the United States on Saturday. The 17 dead included both men and women. The seven sailors confirmed dead are: Electronics Technician 1st Class Richard Costelow, Morrisville, Pa.; Signalman Seaman Recruit Cheron Ouis Gunn, Rex, Ga.; Seaman James Rodrick McDaniels, Norfolk, Va.; Seaman Recruit Lakiba Nicole Palmer, San Diego, Calif.; Operations Specialist 2nd Class Timothy Lamont Saunders, Ringold, Va.; Ensign Andrew Triplett, Macon, Miss., and Seaman Apprentice Craig Bryan Wibberley, Williamsport, Md. The Navy also released the names of sailors who are listed as missing, but whom officials have said were killed in the blast. Those sailors are Hull Maintenance Technician 3rd Class Kenneth Eugene Clodfelter, Mechanicsville, Va.; Mess Management Specialist Seaman Lakeina Monique Francis, Woodleaf, N.C.; Information Systems Technician Seaman Timothy Lee Gauna, Rice, Texas; Engineman 2nd Class Mark Ian Nieto, Fond Du Lac, Wis.; Electronics Warfare Technician 3rd Class Ronald Scott Owens, Vero Beach, Fla.; Engineman Fireman Joshua Langdon Parlett, Churchville, Md.; Fireman Apprentice Patrick Howard Roy, Cornwall on Hudson, N.Y.; Electronics Warfare Technician 2nd Class Kevin Shawn Rux, Portland, N.D.; Mess Management Specialist 3rd Class Ronchester Mananga Santiago, Kingsville, Texas, and Fireman Gary Graham Swenchonis, Jr., Rockport, Texas.

When an explosion rocked Britain's embassy in Sana early Friday, the blast sent off echoes of a murky terrorist underworld in Yemen whose activities have been linked to suspected Islamic extremists in Britain. Britain's ambiguous ties with Yemen date to its occupation of Aden in 1839 while the British and the Ottoman empires were vying for influence in a far-flung corner of the Arabian peninsula. With the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869, however, the port became a vital link in the sea routes between Britain and its imperial outpost in India. British rule in Aden came to an end only in 1967 after fighting. In more recent times, experts said, it was Britain's role as an ally of the United States and as a symbol of Western maneuvering in Iraq and elsewhere in the Middle East that made it a potential target in the region. ``If the British are coming under fire, it is nothing to do with the past,'' said Dr. Gerd Nonneman, the director of the British Society for Middle Eastern Studies, who specializes in Yemen. ``It's everything to do with the policy in Iraq and support for the United States.'' Yet, Britain's relationship with Yemen has a particular profile of its own, linked to the imam of a north London mosque in the Finsbury Park district, Abu Hamza al-Masri, whose stepson is one of five British Muslims serving jail terms in Yemen. The country's pro-Western government last year accused them in a trial of planning a terrorist bombing campaign. During the trial, Yemeni authorities accused Abu Hamza of being allied with a Yemeni extremist group known as the Islamic Army of Aden-Abyan. The group's leader, Abu al-Hassan al-Mihdar, was executed after a separate trial, also last year. Citing anti-terrorism laws, British police investigated Abu Hamza, who has said he fought with the Afghan mujahedeen. The police dropped their inquiries because of lack of evidence. But the events that led up to the trial gave some inkling of the ability of small extremist groups to operate in Yemen or penetrate the country in preparation for a major attack. ``Yemeni terrorism has been vastly exaggerated,'' Nonneman said in a telephone interview from Lancaster University, where he teaches. ``There are various groups inside the country, as in lots of countries, maybe with only two or three people who might call themselves anything from Jihad to Hezbollah,'' he said, referring to the Arabic words for ``holy war'' and ``party of God.'' ``The difference in Yemen is that the government doesn't control all the territory and therefore does not get access to where these groups might be hiding out,'' he said. He drew a distinction between Friday's embassy bombing and the deadly attack Thursday on the U.S. destroyer Cole in the Yemeni port of Aden. While the embassy bomb could well have been Yemeni-inspired, he said, the attack on the Cole required a level of intelligence-gathering and technical expertise ``that indicated that it was not completely home-grown. ``But the reason why it happens in Yemen is because these groups can get access and the government doesn't have control over the territory,'' he said. And, with passions heightened throughout the Arab world by the Palestinian-Israeli clashes, he said, ``the Americans are seen as the supporters of Israel, and these extremist groups find their room for maneuver is increasing.'' Britain's most recent brush with Yemeni terrorism dates to a bizarre saga that began in 1998. Late on Dec. 23 or early on Dec. 24 of that year, a Daewoo rental car carrying three occupants crashed after speeding away from a police road check. The Yemeni police said they found weapons and explosives in the car. Immediately afterward, five British Muslims and a man with a French passport were arrested. Just days after the British Muslims were arrested, 16 British tourists traveling in Yemen's Abyan region were kidnapped in what the Yemeni authorities called an attempt to force the release of the Britons. On Dec. 29, 1998, one day after the kidnapping, Yemeni forces tried to free the British hostages by force, and four of the Britons died in a gun battle. Two of the kidnappers were killed, and three were arrested. Then, on Jan. 26, 1999, Yemeni forces besieged a mountain hideout and arrested six more suspects in the kidnapping, including three Britons with family and other ties to Abu Hamza. In the ensuing trials last year, Yemeni prosecutors sought to link the British Muslims and Abu Hamza in north London with the Yemeni extremists who kidnapped the British tourists. But the hearings remained murky because of reporting restrictions and frequent allegations by defendants that ``confessions'' had been extracted under torture. Newspaper reports quoted Abu Hamza in London as threatening reprisals against British and U.S. interests in Yemen. According to the British Foreign Office, five of the British Muslims are still in prison in Yemen serving sentences of between three and seven years. Two were freed after the 1999 trials and one was released during the trials. Officials said that after the trial, there had been a threat to bomb a British consulate in Yemen. A Foreign Office spokeswoman said only that a bomb had been thrown over the embassy wall and that a judgment on whether this was a terrorist attack would depend on the outcome of an investigation in Yemen by British police.

The bodies of five sailors killed in an attack on a Navy ship in Yemen arrived Friday evening in Germany on their way back to the United States. Light rain fell as an Air Force honor guard silently transferred the caskets draped in U.S. flags from an Air Force jet into separate hearses. Flags at the base in western Germany flew at half staff, and sailors in dress blues stood on the tarmac during the ceremony. The caskets were being taken to Landstuhl Regional Medical Center, and were to be transported to Dover Air Force Base in Delaware on Saturday, said Capt. Todd White, a spokesman at Ramstein. White said the bodies of two more sailors recovered so far might arrive on later flights carrying some of the wounded. Lt. Cmdr. Daren Pelkie, at the Bahrain base of the U.S. Navy 5th Fleet, said more than 30 sailors had been flown to Germany for medical attention. They were expected to arrive before midnight Friday and be taken to the Landstuhl Regional Medical Center, a U.S. military facility. Other injured sailors have been taken to the east African country of Djibouti. The United States says 17 sailors died and 33 were injured in the explosion on the USS Cole while it was refueling in the Yemeni port of Aden. Seven bodies have so far been recovered. The blast tore a hole 30 feet high and 40 feet wide at the ship's waterline. U.S. officials say suicide bombers blew up a small boat next to the destroyer.

With euphoria sweeping the newly liberated Serbia, President Clinton might have expected a hearty greeting when he phoned Vojislav Kostunica last week to congratulate him on the democratic revolution he led. The conversation was cordial enough, the Serbian leader's aides said, but Kostunica had a few sharp words for Clinton: Lift the sanctions now. Economic sanctions sting. When carefully applied and diligently enforced, they can work. Sanctions almost certainly contributed to the fall of Slobodan Milosevic, who had survived the loss of four civil wars and a bombing by NATO. The Yugoslavia case could salvage the reputation of these shout-instead-of-shoot expressions of moral and political outrage. ``There's no question that they played a significant role,'' said Stuart Eizenstat, the U.S. deputy treasury secretary who has helped to design and administer sanctions. ``They helped to bring down the economy and created the conditions that led to the uprising.'' Exactly what prompted Serbians to vote Milosevic out of office and then take to the streets to enforce their will may take years to decipher fully. Some people argue that international pressure did more harm than good, creating a patriotic backlash that actually sustained Milosevic in power and postponed the day of reckoning. There is also no question that the sanctions inflicted collateral damage on people who were never supposed to be targets. Kostunica's stern comments to Clinton reflect popular anger at the United States because it led the sanctions campaign. At home, political sentiment has begun to turn against the use of trade and investment embargoes in all but the most egregious cases. Academic studies have shown that sanctions _ especially those applied by the United States alone without support from major allies in Europe and elsewhere _ rarely achieve the intended results even when left in place for many years. Multinational corporations have formed lobbying groups devoted to eliminating or easing sanctions on Cuba, Libya, Iran, Iraq and other nations. USA Engage, one such group in Washington, estimates that sanctions cost $15 billion to $19 billion in lost exports each year and that American companies employ 200,000 fewer people in high-wage, export-oriented jobs because of lost sales. But the Yugoslavia case could plausibly be remembered as the most significant success for economic sanctions since the fall of the apartheid regime in South Africa more than a decade ago. Yugoslavia could also provide a road map for how to achieve results and avoid common pitfalls. The NATO allies imposed a variety of sanctions on Yugoslavia beginning in 1992, during the war in Bosnia. The sanctions had so-called outer and inner walls, with the outer wall cutting off Yugoslavia from official aid and the inner wall, elements of which were added gradually, slapping restrictions on many Serbian companies and the Milosevic-linked elite. The sanctions also included restrictions on air travel and oil sales to Yugoslavia, though both of those sets were eased even before Milosevic's fall. Clinton and European leaders have promised to lift many of the sanctions now that Kostunica has come to power. The outer wall may remain in place until Milosevic stands trial. Perhaps the most significant breakthrough in Yugoslavia was that the United States and Europe stuck together. Basic unity prevailed despite numerous battles behind the scenes and frequent modifications to the sanctions. The Western nations worked closely together to restrict commerce with state-owned companies, a major factor in the economic collapse that Serbia experienced after the war in Kosovo. The economy shrank by 20 percent in 1999, with inflation hitting 50 percent and almost one-third of Serbians surviving without regular work. Another lesson is that as far as sanctions go, the rifle outperforms the shotgun. Western powers identified about 300 members of the Serbian elite closely tied to Milosevic and barred them from traveling to the West. The ban forced businesspeople as well as the political and intellectual elite of this once relatively open Central European nation to choose between Milosevic and their ties to Europe. The crumbling of elite support may have helped undermine him. Sanctions inevitably remain a blunt instrument, especially when the goal is the replacement of a single leader. Serbia suffered through severe electricity shortages and an effective cutoff of medical equipment, a shortage that many Serbs believe led to unnecessary deaths. At least for a time, such sentiments helped Milosevic rally anti-Western support. Gordana Ristic, 35, a marketing executive in Belgrade who lost much of her business because of sanctions, said many Serbs felt a patriotic duty to defend their nation when sanctions were first imposed. That delayed what she described as an inevitable rebellion against Milosevic, though she did not deny that Serbs eventually rose up, in part because they tired of the pain and isolation. ``We have an image of ourselves as Europeans, and not as poor Europeans, so that hurt,'' she said in a telephone conversation last week. ``But if you think we are going to thank the United States for doing this to us, you will be kept waiting.''

Grudging or not, President Clinton's decision to accept Republican-crafted legislation allowing reimportation of prescription drugs gives the GOP bragging rights on an important campaign issue. Frustrated Democrats are left to complain that the measure is designed purely as political cover for the Republicans and will do nothing to bring down drug costs for older Americans. ``There are loopholes in there you could drive a train through,'' said Senate Democratic leader Tom Daschle. Nevertheless, the plan will get the South Dakota senator's vote as well as Clinton's signature. By prior arrangement, Democratic officials said, Clinton will attack the prescription drug provision as an empty promise when he signs it into law as part of a broader, politically appealing bill to provide billions of dollars for agricultural programs. Beyond that, the administration is preparing a broader counterattack, with the Department of Health and Human Services expected to produce a written description that will depict the legislation as unenforceable. The bill's stated purpose is to let drugs be brought back into the United States from Canada and other countries where they cost less than here. The potential savings to consumers are eye-catching. According to Democrats, the allergy/sinus medication Flonase Nasal costs $46.00 in the United States and $23.00 in Canada. Likewise, 45 pills of the anti-depressant Prozac at 20 milligrams cost $105.64 in the United States, $43.00 in Canada. ``I do not think saving money for seniors is a partisan issue,'' Rep. Gil Gutknecht, R-Minn, said as the House approved the legislation this week. It is one now, less than a month before Election Day, with control of the House and Senate at stake. ``This arrangement could drop prescription drug costs by 30 to 50 percent, a welcome discount for many seniors who take medicines daily,'' Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., said in a statement after the measure went to the Senate for a final vote. The House Democratic leader, Rep. Dick Gephardt of Missouri, saw it differently. ``Looking for political cover after repeatedly blocking a Medicare prescription benefit, the Republican leadership put out a sham reimportation measure that isn't worth the government paper it's printed on,'' Gephardt said. It is, he said, ``a capitulation to the special interests.'' Still, maneuvering on the issue marks at least a short-term political victory for Republicans, who have been laboring to show older people they are attuned to the high costs of prescription drugs. With the parties unable to agree on a prescription drug benefit for Medicare recipients, another area in which bipartisanship is elusive, the reimportation legislation is the only law Congress will pass this year on the subject. Some polls show that prescription drugs rank high on the list of voter issues, particularly in the key battleground states of the Midwest. In the presidential race, the issue continues to favor Al Gore over Texas Gov. George W. Bush, despite extensive GOP efforts to narrow the gap. A recent Pew poll, for example, gave Gore a 50-31 edge over his Republican rival as the candidate better able to make prescription drugs more affordable. A more recent internal poll taken for House Republicans gave Democrats a small but still healthy advantage in roughly 40 targeted districts surveyed. Republican sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that in a meeting this fall with GOP senators seeking re-election, Majority Leader Trent Lott identified the so-called reimportation legislation as a salve for a campaign sore spot. Exercising the prerogatives of the majority, the GOP decided to graft the importation provision onto a routine spending bill that provides money for the Department of Agriculture, the Food and Drug Administration and other agencies. The overall measure includes more than $2 billion in disaster relief for farmers, thus making it a difficult bill to oppose. The same legislation allows limited sale of food to Cuba and other nations, but Democrats complain of the provision's restrictions on financing and travel. In secret consultations late last week, according to congressional officials, the White House and House and Senate Democrats debated the wisdom of a veto, balancing the political appeal of billions of dollars in farm aid against the drug and Cuba provisions they were dissatisfied with. The decision was to split the difference, accept the package, then attempt to dampen any political benefit that Republican lawmakers might gain. ___ EDITOR'S NOTE _ David Espo is chief congressional correspondent of The Associated Press.

Kidnapping tribes, gun-toting children and alleged links to Mideast terrorist groups give Yemen an outlaw image that seems incompatible with its recent role as a refueling point for U.S. military vessels. Now, with the destroyer USS Cole crippled by an apparent suicide blast and the bodies of American sailors being sent home for burial, serious questions are emerging about the decision and whether Yemen will be stricken from the itinerary of U.S. warships. ``This is obviously of concern,'' said Lt. Terrence Dudley, a spokesman for the U.S. 5th Fleet based in the Persian Gulf nation of Bahrain. ``There will definitely be a review of the use of Yemen for such purposes,'' said Paul Beaver, spokesman for the Jane's Group of security affairs researchers. Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh denies terrorists were behind the explosion Thursday and insists his country has no ``terrorist elements.'' On Friday, an explosion hit the British Embassy in his capital San`a, 200 miles from Aden. No one was hurt in what Britain's foreign secretary said was a bombing. Yemen is part of a network for a host of terrorist groups, including Osama bin Laden's, according to Western sources. The United States accuses bin Laden of masterminding the bombings of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania two years ago that killed 224 people. The site of the Cole attack, the port of Aden, is a base for the militant Islamic Army of Aden, founded by bin Laden's brother, Muhammad Khalifa, said Vincent Cannistraro, a former chief of counterterrorism at the CIA. The group's leader, Zein al-Abidine al-Midhar, was executed by firing squad two years ago in the hostage-taking of two Americans and 14 other Western tourists. Al-Midhar's successor, Hatim bin Farid, is facing trial for planning to kidnap foreign tourists and attack government targets. Bin Laden has sharply criticized the use of Yemen as a refueling spot for U.S. military ships, Beaver said. Hamas and the Iranian-backed Palestine Islamic Jihad group also have a presence in Yemen. It's also become a center for another rogue trade: abducting foreigners. Kidnappers use their hostages as bargaining chips to free jailed comrades or extract promises of police tolerance for illegal trades. Most of the captives, including Polish and U.S. diplomats, were released unharmed by northern tribesmen _ whose culture encourages ownership of weapons for boys as young as 10. Yemen's wild reputation actually attracts a certain breed of tourists, who come to see tribesmen swaggering down the streets with guns tucked into waistbands next to traditional curved daggers known as jambiyas. Some may even hope to be kidnapped, hearing they would be treated as honored tribal guests and released after a few days. But four Western tourists captured by the Aden-Abyan group were killed in a botched rescue attempt by security forces in 1998. The government responded with tough laws allowing execution for kidnappers. So far, three people have been put to death. Despite some daring visitors, the kidnapping threat has ravaged Yemen's small, but economically important, tourism industry. ``We all fear that Yemen will be punished economically by this latest tragedy,'' said Bashrahell Hisham Bashraheel, an Aden-based correspondent for Yemen's largest newspaper, Al-Ayyam.

The Pentagon will review whether Navy ships in foreign ports should tighten security policies in light of the apparent terrorist bombing of the USS Cole in Yemen. The Navy was concentrating Friday mainly on restoring power and communications aboard the Cole, recovering missing sailors in the flooded ship and helping the crew's relatives back home. But officials said the explosion is certain to lead to a review of security procedures and whether Yemen's main port, Aden, should still be used as a ship refueling stop. ``Every tragedy like this provokes a period of reflection,'' Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon said. ``And there will certainly be review and reflection after this one, and we will look at our security procedures.'' Bacon said the Navy had not made a decision on whether to use Aden again as a refueling stop. Ships traveling in groups usually have an oiler with them to provide fuel, but ships sailing alone, as was the Cole, normally have to make port visits to refuel. Aden had been used as a refueling point numerous times this year. Defense Secretary William Cohen, meanwhile, decided to curtail a Latin America tour that was scheduled to start Sunday. To focus on the Cole, Cohen dropped plans to visit the capitals of Brazil, Chile and Argentina, although a meeting of Latin American defense ministers in Manaus, Brazil, remains on his schedule for now. Bacon said Cohen plans to attend a Navy memorial for victims of the Cole attack, likely to be held Wednesday in Norfolk, Va. Bacon said President Clinton also may attend. The Navy also will review the way in which it contracts with local harbor authorities for the kind of help it required in Aden, Bacon said. Harbor boats were helping the Cole attach mooring lines at a fuel facility in the middle of the harbor when one of the boats pulled alongside the warship and apparently detonated a bomb. Arrangements for harbor assistance were, as a matter of normal practice, made through the U.S. Embassy in the Yemeni capital, San`a. Bacon said the Navy already began its investigation of the incident. ``I'm sure there will be other reviews in the coming days, and I think we'll be able to announce something soon,'' he said. The Navy said the casualty toll stood Friday at seven confirmed dead and 10 missing and presumed dead. Of 38 injured, five were returned to duty, and the 33 others were either flown or were being prepared to fly to a U.S. medical facility in Germany. Most of the rest of the crew remained aboard the Cole. ``We don't want to destroy hope, but we don't want to create false hope, either,'' said Adm. Vernon Clark, the chief of naval operations. Other Navy officials said the assumption is that the missing are dead, but there will be no formal change in their status until they are recovered, since the bodies are known to be inside the ship. The Navy released the names of the dead and missing Friday. All but one is from the enlisted crew. Two are female, the first time a female sailor has been killed in hostile action aboard a U.S. combat ship. In an interview with The Associated Press, Clark said Navy bomb experts determined without doubt Friday the explosion that tore through the Cole was an external blast. He said that information all but confirms the explosion was a deliberate act of sabotage, not an accident. ``I've said all along, from where I stand, in my view this was clearly a terrorist act,'' Clark said. The explosives experts who examined the ship estimated the hole in the port, or left, side to be 30 feet high and 40 feet wide. ``There had been some talk that this was a blast internal to the ship; their conclusion is: no way,'' Clark said. ``Clearly it was a blast from outside.''

With the crippled USS Cole listing slightly in the harbor, American investigators, Marines and soldiers swarmed into this deep-water port Friday, bringing sniffer dogs and sophisticated equipment to search for clues in the blast that killed 17 American sailors. Wounded U.S. sailors and the bodies of some of the dead were flown to Germany en route home; the Navy said the ship would be repaired and stay in service. The Navy released the names of the 17 dead on Friday. All but one were from the enlisted ranks and two were women. Lt. Terrence Dudley, a U.S. Navy spokesman in Aden, said Navy chaplains had arrived to console survivors. ``I'm just numb. It hasn't sunk in yet,'' said Patty Wibberley, mother of Seaman Craig Wibberley, 19, killed in the explosion. His duties had included raising and lowering the destroyer's small anchor. Western diplomats said the attack was apparently the work of a well-organized group. Bomb experts quickly determined Thursday's explosion ``was a blast from the outside,'' Adm. Vernon Clark, the chief naval officer, said in an interview with The Associated Press in Washington. His comments countered any suggestion weaponry aboard the ship might have been responsible. U.S. officials say suicide bombers blew up a small boat next to the 8,600-ton destroyer, ripping a 30-by-40-foot hole at the water line. Western diplomats in Yemen said the explosion seemed to be the work of a well-organized group with good connections in the port of Aden who might have provided the bombers with logistical support. The diplomats, insisting on anonymity, said the boat used by the bombers was similar to boats used by port authorities to guide vessels into port or help ships with refueling. If terrorism is proven, the toll would make it the worst such attack on the U.S. military since the bombing of an Air Force barracks in Saudi Arabia in 1996 that killed 19 miiltary personnel. More than 200 miles away, in the capital, San`a, an explosion on Friday rocked the British Embassy. Windows shattered but nobody was hurt. Britain's foreign secretary said a bomb may have been flung into embassy grounds. Authorities were investigating. Anti-Western sentiment has been running high in the Arab world, with protesters condemning the United States in particular during demonstrations against Israel's use of force in two weeks of deadly clashes in Jerusalem and the Palestinian territories. ``The world should not underestimate the anger of Palestinians at this moment,'' said Mohammed al-Sharq, a member of the small Palestinian community in Aden who, like many here, said he believed ``outside forces'' were responsible for the attack on the Cole. Esam al Najjar, a Palestinian-Yemeni working for a cement company, said such attacks can never be condoned, ``but you must put yourself in the place of the people who carried it out. You have to try to understand that for some people, this is the only way left to respond.'' Yemen was one of the countries where members of the Palestine Liberation Organization settled after being forced from Lebanon. The Palestinian community has dwindled from several thousand in the 1980s to 200-300 today in Aden, a desert city known for its infestation of crows _ a bad omen to Arabs _ and blocky, Soviet-era architecture. President Clinton dispatched investigators from the FBI, U.S. State Department and Pentagon to Yemen, and ordered a heightened state of alert for all U.S. military installations around the world. More than 100 FBI evidence and explosives experts were expected to arrive over the weekend. The Cole investigation was taking place under tight security in this city of 800,000 squeezed between the sea and a range of jagged hills. Yemeni soldiers were posted outside the hotel where most U.S. investigators and their Marine guards were staying. Inside, the Marines carried automatic rifles and closely monitored anyone coming in. The ship, a white cloth billowing over the gaping hole ripped into the hull by the blast, sat isolated in an inner area of the harbor. Yemeni speedboats patrolled the area bounded by the coast and a peninsula. Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon said Friday the ship is stable, some power has been restored and Navy divers found the keel in good shape. Other large ships _ container ships and cargo vessels _ were moored elsewhere as business went on as usual in much of the rest of the large harbor. But the Cole drew attention, with dozens of people gathered along a stone seawall on the harbor to gaze at the mighty, stricken ship. The Cole is a $1 billion guided missile destroyer home-ported at Norfolk, Va. It was heading with a crew of about 293 to the gulf to support the U.N. embargo against Iraq. At the Ramstein Air Base in western Germany, a flight carrying the bodies of five of the dead arrived Friday. Light rain fell as an Air Force honor guard silently transferred the caskets draped in U.S. flags from an Air Force jet into separate hearses. Flags at the base in western Germany flew at half staff, and sailors in dress blues stood on the tarmac during the ceremony. Lt. Cmdr. Daren Pelkie, at the Bahrain base of the U.S. Navy 5th Fleet, said more than 30 sailors had been flown to Germany for medical attention. Others were taken to the east African country of Djibouti. There have been no claims of responsibility for the blast that have gained widespread credibility. One U.S. official said this reflected a trend among militant groups not to claim responsibility for attacks in order to elude intelligence gathering. However, Omar Bakri Mohammed, a leader of Al-Muhajiroun, a London-based Arab militant group, said Friday he had received an international call claiming responsibility for the attack on the American ship. It was in the name of ``Muhammad's Army,'' an extremist group previously known to be active only in Chechnya and Dagestan. Bakri, who is known to have ties to terror suspect Osama bin Laden, said he was skeptical of the claim but some of his skepticism waned after Friday's bombing at the British Embassy because the group promised more attacks in its call Thursday. It warned that ``strikes will continue until the Muslim land and Palestine are liberated,'' he said. Meanwhile, a close associate of bin Laden urged Muslims worldwide to attack U.S. and Israeli targets to avenge the deaths of Palestinians killed in bloody and protracted clashes with Israel. Ayman el Zawahri, who was found guilty in absentia of the 1981 assassination of Egyptian President Anwar Sadat, faxed his call for ``jihad,'' or holy war, to the Islamabad bureau of the Abu Dhabi channel of the United Arab Emirates Television, bureau chief Jamal Ismael said. The U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the call was similar to others that have been made recently and would be evaluated. Islamic extremists have been active in Yemen. However, Yemen's Prime Minister Abdul-Karim al-Iryani said in March that bin Laden, at one time had ``colleagues'' in Yemen but now ``has no place in Yemen, no military camps.'' The United States accuses bin Laden of organizing a network with followers across the Mideast, including Yemen, and says he masterminded the 1998 bombings of U.S. embassies in Africa that killed 224 people.

The United States received a general warning of a possible attack on a U.S. warship last month, senior defense officials said here Friday, but the warning lacked detail and did not specify the country in which to expect the attack. ``It was a question of how directly you could tie it to a certain place,'' one of the officials said. Since the warning, reported by an intelligence source in the Arab world, was not specific enough, ``it got put on the shelf.'' Nor was it clear that the warning could have stopped what officials described Friday as a sophisticated suicide bombing. While the Cole's crew had extensive training in repelling an overt attack by a small boat and even had extra sailors on watch on Thursday, the attack was so meticulously disguised and carried out that the officials said there was little the crew could have done to stop it. But as new details emerged on the attack Friday, the developing U.S. investigation focused on the Yemeni contractor hired to refuel American warships at the port in Aden, and on an unsubstantiated claim of responsibility by an Islamic organization, officials here said. As the first teams of criminal investigators and experts arrived in Yemen, the officials said the contractor, whom they declined to identify, was the immediate focus because the harbor boat that exploded beside the Cole on Thursday, killing 17 sailors, had been taking part in routine refueling operations at the port. It was not clear what, if any, security procedures were in place to screen the contractor, and officials attributed responsibility variously to military commanders in the region, the Pentagon's logistics agency and the American Embassy in Sana, the Yemeni capital. Officials declined to discuss the matter, saying it was being investigated. A group called the Islamic Army of Aden claimed responsibility for the bombing, and officials said that while they had not yet confirmed the authenticity of the claim, they took it seriously. The group has been linked to terrorist attacks including the bombing of a hotel in Aden and the kidnapping of tourists, the officials said. A senior defense official said the claim was ``sort of elliptical,'' but another official who attended a classified briefing on Capitol Hill on Thursday night, said it appeared credible. ``It passes the straight-face test,'' the official said. ``This wasn't just a guy with a Web site.'' The Pentagon spokesman, Kenneth H. Bacon, said Friday that officials had ordered a review of security procedures for refueling stops like the Cole's. In addition to the installation in Aden, U.S. ships also regularly stop at a port outside Djibouti, officials said. ``Every tragedy like this provokes a period of reflection, and there will certainly be review and reflection after this one,'' Bacon said. Agents from the FBI began arriving in Yemen on Friday, the first of them from the bureau's office in Cairo, and more were expected to pour in over the weekend. Officials said forensic examination of the damage, which will identify the type of explosives used, had already begun. Other agents were concentrating on who might have had access to the harbor boat, as well as on information about the Cole's brief stop in Aden. Adm. Vern Clark, the chief of naval operations, said the Yemeni government had been notified of the visit 10 to 12 days ahead of time. A defense official said that by Wednesday, a day before the Cole arrived, it would have been widely expected in the port. ``If you want fresh fruit or vegetables you have to tell people when to be on the pier,'' the official, who is involved in security operations overseas, said. ``If you want fuel, you have to tell people to be there at the facility.'' Navy weapons experts, along with divers examining the Cole's ravaged port side, determined that the explosion had torn into the ship with significant, apparently concentrated, force, underscoring the sophistication of the attack. After an underwater inspection of the hull, officials said the damage had been more extensive than first reported. A defense official said the hole measured nearly 40 feet by 40 feet, much of it beneath the surface. One explosives expert said the blast had probably been caused by several hundred pounds of high explosives, which detonated against or within a few feet of the Cole. Christopher Ronay, a former FBI explosives expert, said it was unlikely that the bomb makers had used the homemade chemistry of ammonium nitrate and fuel oil employed at the World Trade Center in New York in 1993 or at the Federal Building in Oklahoma City in 1995. That is because the dry chemicals used in such explosives absorb water _ a factor that might preclude their use around water. He said the bomb's composition was more likely to have been several hundred pounds of high explosives like PETN or TNT, or a combination of such compounds, which have been found in terrorist bombs exploded in the Middle East dating back to the attacks on the U.S. Embassy and a military barracks in Beirut, Lebanon, in the early 1980s. Still, the officials said they had not ruled out any one of several other known terrorist groups, including followers of Osama bin Laden, the Saudi exile whom U.S. officials blamed for the bombings of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in August 1998.

The U.S. Navy announced Friday night that 17 sailors were killed in the blast on the destroyer here on Thursday after divers spent the day searching the harbor bed for missing crew members and clues to the explosion's cause. Ten sailors were still missing, and 38 were wounded. The death toll on the Cole, a Navy destroyer outfitted with guided missiles and sophisticated electronic equipment, would make it the worst attack on the U.S. military since the bombing of an Air Force barracks in Saudi Arabia in 1996 that killed 19 personnel. Diving operations were suspended for the night, more than 32 hours after the blast, which blew a 40-by-40-foot hole in the Cole's port side, slightly larger than first reported. Witnesses said the vessel was attacked by two men in a small harbor boat that exploded as it drew alongside the U.S. vessel during the start of a refueling stop at this port on the southern tip of the Arabian peninsula. While U.S. energies in Aden focused on the recovery effort, a worldwide hunt began in earnest Friday to track down the group responsible for what had every appearance as a terrorist attack, though U.S. officials stopped short of publicly using the word terrorism. There were reports of two Islamic groups claiming responsibility, but these could not be verified, and U.S. American officials said their investigation had produced no firm leads so far. Two senior defense officials said the United States had received a unspecific warning of a possible attack on a U.S. warship last month, but it lacked detail and did not mention a specific country where the attack was expected. ``It was a question of how directly you could tie it to a certain place,'' one said.

While the Cole's crew had extensive training in repelling an overt attack by a small boat and even had extra sailors on watch on Thursday, the blast had been so meticulously disguised and carried out that the officials said there was little the crew could have done to stop it. While immediate suspicion fell on Islamic radical groups that have used Yemen as a base for terrorist attacks in the past, but there was no concrete evidence to support this. During the day, there were reports that two Islamic groups claimed to have attacked the Cole, but it was not immediately clear whether these were propaganda stunts by groups seeking publicity from deeds done by others. In London, where he lives in self-exile, a Syrian-born Islamic radical, Sheikh Omar Bakri, was reported as saying that he had received a phone call from a group calling itself Mohammed's Army, which said it had attacked the Cole and the British Embassy in Sana, the Yemeni capital, 190 miles north of Aden. The group said it intended to take hostages and continue bombing all American and British embassies, according to news reports Later in the day a previously unknown organization said in Beirut that it had carried out the attack. Terrorism experts mulled various theories Friday, among them the possibility that the ship was attacked in retaliation for events in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, where two weeks of confrontations between Israelis and Palestinians have produced a wave of anger across the Arab world directed at Israel, and to some extent for the United States, which is widely seen by Arabs as backing Israeli policies. Experts also weighed other possibilities, including a group sympathetic to Iraq and eager to strike against the Cole, which has been scheduled to join a U.S. flotilla enforcing trade sanctions on Iraq since its invasion of Kuwait in 1990. Western terrorism specialists also said it was possible that the attack had nothing to do with the recent hostilities in the Middle East because it appeared to be a well-planned assault that would have required a substantial amount of time to plan, more than the two weeks since fighting broke out in region. It was also not clear, these experts said, that any Islamic group in Yemen could have had sufficient notice of the arrival of the Cole, whose refueling stop here, the 13th made by a U.S. navy ship in the past two years, was not announced in advance. During the day, fears of a wider terror campaign were stirred when an explosive device believed to have been a bomb was thrown over the wall at the British embassy in Sana. The device, which exploded shortly after dawn atop a diesel generator in the embassy courtyard, damaged the building, but there were no casualties. U.S. efforts in Aden on Friday concentrated on the search for the missing and on efforts at what a Navy spokesman described as ``stabilizing'' the crippled destroyer where it lay listing at its mooring point in a broad channel that leads into the inner harbor from the Gulf of Aden. Reporters were kept far away from the vessel, and even prevented by U.S. and Yemeni officials from photographing it and the huge hole on the vessel's port side was _ visible until daybreak on Friday _ was covered by what appeared to be large white tarpaulins. But a Navy spokesman, Lt. Terrence Dudley, who flew in with scores of other Navy personnel from the U.S. Navy's 5th Fleet's headquarters in the Persian Gulf state of Bahrain, said the recovery effort had succeeded to the point where there was no danger of the Cole going to the bottom of Aden's deep-water harbor. ``The ship is not in any danger of sinking'', he said, adding that Navy officials had been ``evacuating water'' from the engine-room and other compartments at the water line that he said had been ``extensively damaged'' by the blast. Fleet commanders overseeing the operation had decided for now not to attempt to move the Cole from its mooring point about a mile off the crowded harbor front. Through binoculars, the ship appeared to be listing gently on its port side, and was busy throughout the day with teams of Navy men who gathered aboard a smaller vessel with a flat platform that was moored just beside the gaping hole in its side. The platform appeared to be being used for efforts to probe inside the damaged compartments, and possibly for divers being lowered on to the seabed. Apart from the dead and wounded, who accounted for nearly a sixth of the 293-strong crew, the rest of the ship's complement remained aboard, many of them forced by blast damage below deck to bed for the night in sleeping bags under awnings stretched over the open decks. But details revealed during the day by Navy officials suggested that the attackers may have come perilously close to sinking the vessel, or at least of so severely damaging it that the death toll could have been far higher. Dudley told reporters the destroyer had sustained ``a lot of internal damage,'' with extensive flooding of many of the lower compartments, as well as the engine room, and that the flooding was complicating efforts to search for any signs of the missing men aboard the ship and to look for clues as to the identity of the attackers and the type of explosives used. He said the tentative plan was to pump out the water from the damaged compartments, make some temporary repairs in Aden and then tow it back to the United States for permanent repairs. He turned away questions about the identity of the attackers, saying it was an issue for the team of about 100 specialists from the FBI, the CIA and the Navy who began arriving here from Washington, Europe and the Persian Gulf late Thursday. An edge of impatience crept into Navy officers' remarks when they were asked about the assertions on Thursday by Yemen's president, Ali Abdullah Saleh, that the Cole explosion appeared to have been an accident that began with a blast aboard the U.S. ship, not a terrorist act. It remained unclear, however, whether Yemeni investigators, who appeared to be playing no direct part in the activities around the Cole on Friday, would have any enthusiasm for investigating any terrorist aspects of the affair in the light of Saleh's continued insistence that the explosion was an accident. When the Yemeni assertions were put to Dudley, the Navy spokesman, who like other Navymen appeared for duty here Friday in a light-brown desert-style camouflage uniform, he replied with apparent acerbity: ``We do know that a small boat approached our vessel, that there was a large explosion that was external to our vessel, and that it left our ship with fairly extensive damage of a kind that clearly was inflicted from outside. The evidence we have seen clearly shows that the explosion occurred outside our vessel.'' Dudley, offering a more detailed account of the attack than the sketchy version relayed through the Pentagon on Thursday, said that the Cole entered the Aden harbor and began to tie up to a mooring point near the fuel depot at 8.45 a.m. local time, 1.45 a.m. Thursday EDT. About 45 minutes later, at 9.30 a.m. when the Cole was circled by several smaller boats, some of which were involved in the mooring and re-fueling operations and others dedicated to clearing garbage and other refuse from the Cole, another small boat approached the Cole from across the harbor, he said, and this was immediately followed by the blast. The small boat in question appeared to be the motorized rubber dinghy described on Thursday by witnesses, including several Aden citizens, who described the two men aboard it as standing erect at the moment of the blast, as if in some kind of salutation. Yemeni officials said Friday that as far as they knew the recovery operations around the Cole so far produced no remains identifiable as those of the men on the dinghy.

The U.S. Navy announced Friday night that 7 sailors were killed in the blast on the destroyer here on Thursday after divers spent the day searching the harbor bed for missing crew members and clues to the explosion's cause. Ten sailors were still missing, presumed dead, and 38 were wounded.

Yemen is a failed state on the mend just around the corner from Somalia, in a truly wild neighborhood. It has been a haven for international terrorists and radical Islamic groups and there is little evidence that the government has any control over them. Given these facts, some critics are already blaming policy-makers for placing U.S. forces in such a dangerous place _ and by extension, in all such places. Using a refueling stop to build stronger ties with a volatile and struggling Arab nation not only backfired, such critics say, it shouldn't have been tried. ``It's not worth the risk,'' said Richard N. Haass, director of foreign policy studies at the Brookings Institution who served on the National Security Council under President George Bush. ``Yemen has a bad record, and it's still a place where the government is unable or unwilling to take certain steps against certain terrorist groups. We must become more selective and more wary of who we do normal operations with.'' Others at least as numerous insist that the United States must not let terrorists dictate how and where it projects its presence on the globe. And to be sure, the United States is staying put in the Middle East. ``We have very large interests in the region that aren't just important, they are vital,'' said former Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Ind., who headed the House International Relations Committee. Hamilton's list of interests is a long one: unfettered access to affordable oil; protecting Israel's security; limiting the spread of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons and the missiles to launch them; checking the influence of Islamic fundamentalists; advancing economic development in the region. ``It would be an absolute victory for terrorists, if they're behind this attack, if we pulled back and stopped doing our job in the Middle East or elsewhere in the world, and we're not going to give them that victory,'' said the Pentagon spokesman, Kenneth H. Bacon. Indeed, say critics of withdrawal, wouldn't abandoning the field in places like Yemen just leave them open to getting worse? Everyone points to Somalia as the example to avoid. But it wasn't the worst case by any means. Consider, for example, the experts in the Reagan administration who put U.S. troops in a barracks at the airport in Lebanon in 1983. After the killing of 241 U.S. servicemen by a Shiite Muslim driving a suicide truck bomb in October 1983, U.S. resolve was badly shaken and there was a furious domestic debate over whether the United State should have brought in troops in the first place, or whether it should have done so in a different way. The alternative, which came to pass when the U.S. troops left, was Syrian control, for which everyone in the region is still paying the price. The thing that the Saudis, Egyptians and others in the region remember most about the marines in Beirut was not their arrival, but their departure. In Arab eyes, the marines simply cut and ran from Lebanon when the Syrians and their Lebanese allies made the cost of staying too high. Both sides of the leave-or-stay debate, however, ignore a simple point: that there are common-sense rules of engagement for doing business in dodgy places that could reduce the risks of operating in them. First of all, the diplomatic and military services should invest heavily in intelligence, preferably the kind using real eyes and ears, which can infiltrate terrorist groups and snitch. ``We're constantly reading the tea leaves very carefully,'' said one four-star officer with experience in the Middle East. ``You continually assess the intelligence, bounce those observations off others and gauge the host nation's level of security cooperation. These things don't stay on a flat line, they ebb and flow.'' Second, avoid stationing forces where they can become targets of opportunity and resentment. After the 1996 bombing of a housing complex in Saudi Arabia, in which 19 airmen were killed, U.S. troops in Dhahran were moved out of urban compounds into more defensible desert bases. Third, when traveling around the region, go well armed and avoid falling into predictable patterns that are vulnerable to preplanned attack. Fourth, to the extent possible, limit dependence on host-nation support for security, supplies and other services that would allow terrorists to carry out an inside job, as the bombing of the destroyer Cole seems to have been. Fifth, work closely with the host country's intelligence and police forces to limit vulnerabilities. These are pretty straightforward operating principles, but they may be ignored, either because of overconfidence in U.S. armed might (forgetting that the whole point of terrorism is to puncture that very image), or because U.S. forces overseas often want to be seen as benevolent and helpful. ``It's very, very complicated,'' said Adm. Stanley R. Arthur, who commanded allied naval forces in the 1991 Persian gulf war. ``The basic nature of Americans is that we're much more comfortable reaching out than being in a bunker mentality.'' In Lebanon, the United States trusted all factions to accept that it would be an even-handed guardian of order. In Yemen, it trusted the port authority not to be infiltrated by Islamic kamikazes, a doubtful proposition at best. ``They executed the plan as it was specified,'' Adm. Vern Clark, the chief of naval operations said of the U.S. commanders' security precautions. Today, it is clear that the plan was inadequate. What happened in Yemen is a reminder that the world abounds in dangerous places, that U.S. forces are vulnerable whenever they venture into them and that they must take precautions equal to that knowledge.

At 5:30 Monday morning my phone rang. Oh, swell, I thought, somebody died. But it was good news. My brother, Paul Greengard, was calling. ``I just won the Nobel Prize,'' he said. He sounded as though he didn't want to talk too loudly for fear his head would fall off. It's a head filled with things I have never understood. I admire and love my brother, but he lives on a higher plane, and what he does is secret, unrevealable. To me, anyway. Once, when he was a young man going off to some lab or other, I asked what he was going to do that day. ``I am going to pith a frog,'' he said. Whatever that meant, it didn't sound good for the frog, and that was the end of my prying into his life in science. My mother said it was OK for me to turn away from scientific inquiry. ``We don't need another genius around here,'' she declared, thereby demolishing all three of us siblings with a single sentence _ my sister and me, because we weren't so smart, and my brother, because he was too smart for her taste. At 17, he joined the Navy and helped develop an early warning radar system to detect incoming Japanese planes. That's the last thing I remotely understood about his world. Every girl thinks her big brother is smarter and more glamorous than the next guy. My brother was. He even sang like an angel. And he kept moving. ``It is not worthwhile to go around the world to count the cats in Zanzibar,'' said Thoreau, but my brother didn't agree. After the war, he went to Hamilton College and got a degree in two years. I didn't know what he did there. Then he went to Johns Hopkins and worked in a lab all night and got his Ph.D. I didn't know what he did there, either. It wasn't that he refused to tell me, it's just that I couldn't make head or tails of it. He was a fool for education. I couldn't sit through a class without daydreaming _ so I elected a life in art. While my brother was in Britain, on a fellowship to Cambridge, I got my first acting part in a movie by a young director named Stanley Kubrick. My brother could follow what I was doing, but his pursuits remained impenetrable to me. In the late 1950s, he came back to the United States. He worked at the National Institutes of Health in Washington and then at Geigy Research Laboratories in New York. I'd go to dinner with friends, and someone would ask, ``What is your brother doing?'' ``I don't know,'' I would say. ``He's a genius, and they do all different stuff.'' They wouldn't have understood, anyway. But I did know he was involved in something exciting and mysterious, because every time he took a new job _ whether at Albert Einstein College of Medicine or Yale _ I'd ask him about it. Then he'd get into electro-physiological properties, and it was all over. When he went south, to Vanderbilt University, I made the mistake of asking what he would be researching. ``Thermodynamics of the adenylyl cyclase reaction,'' he said. That scared me so that I switched the subject to myself. I'd say, ``I'm singing in this Broadway show called `Tenderloin,' and George Abbot is the director and Maurice Evans drives me home.'' Or: ``I'm playing a juvenile delinquent in this soap opera called `Love of Life.''' Nothing intimidating there. No adenylyl cyclase involved, nothing that would make a person cry. Fated to be singed by the fires of intellectual achievement burning all around me, I accepted my lot and married a guy whose mother was Mary Chase. Back in the 1940s, she had won a Pulitzer Prize for her play ``Harvey.'' Meanwhile, I still didn't know what my brother did. But my opinion of my brother's greatness was confirmed by others who kept giving him dinners and awards. The food part was fine, but when they got to the talking part, I was back to square one. In 1983, Paul came to Rockefeller University in New York, to become the Vincent Astor professor and head of the Laboratory of Molecular and Cellular Neuroscience. Now, he has won the Nobel Prize in physiology and medicine, an honor he shares with two other scientists. In reporting it, the newspapers said their work on the way brain cells communicate might one day help cure diseases like Parkinson's and Alzheimer's. I'm thrilled he won. Now I know what he does.

Yemeni patrol boats cruised near the USS Cole early Saturday, keeping a buffer zone around the stricken ship as U.S. investigators stepped up efforts to determine whether terrorism was behind an explosion that killed 17 of its sailors. Lt. Terrence Dudley, a U.S. Navy spokesman in Aden, said 40 FBI agents and Department of Defense specialists from Washington's Foreign Emergency Support Team were due in Aden Saturday, joining a few experts already in place. Their mission was to ``advise, assist and assess'' a probe that began almost immediately after the explosion Thursday, Dudley said. So far, investigators have worked to secure what U.S. officials increasingly believe is a terrorist crime scene. Divers were examining the hull. More than 100 FBI evidence and explosives experts, including those in the group arriving Saturday, were expected in Aden by the end of the weekend. U.S. officials believe suicide bombers blew up a small boat next to the 8,600-ton destroyer, ripping a 40-by-40-feet hole at the water line. If terrorism is proven, it would be the deadliest such attack on the U.S. military since the bombing of an Air Force barracks in Saudi Arabia in 1996 that killed 19. Western diplomats in Yemen said the explosion seemed to be the work of a well-organized group with good connections in the port of Aden. The Navy said the ship would be repaired and stay in service. In all, 39 Cole sailors were flown for treatment and evaluation at the U.S. military's Landstuhl Regional Medical Center in Germany. Some were taken to Germany after first stopping at a French military hospital in the east African nation of Djibouti. The Navy had earlier said 33 sailors were wounded. Dudley added Saturday that six sailors required treatment for post-traumatic stress. About 20 injured crew members now in Germany were scheduled to return to the Cole's home port of Norfolk, Va. within this weekend, said Cmdr. Beci Brenton in Norfolk. The bodies of five of those killed aboard the Cole were also flown to Germany Friday, and then on to the United States on Saturday, a military spokesman said. They were headed for the Air Force Base in Dover, Del. The Navy released the names of the 17 dead on Friday. All but one were from the enlisted ranks and two were women _ the first female sailors killed in hostile action aboard a U.S. combat ship. The Cole explosion came as anti-Western sentiment ran high in the Arab world, with protesters condemning the United States _ particularly during demonstrations against Israel's use of force in two weeks of deadly clashes in Jerusalem and the Palestinian territories. More than 200 miles from Aden in the capital, San`a, an explosion on Friday rocked the British Embassy. Windows shattered but nobody was hurt. Britain's foreign secretary said a bomb may have been flung into embassy grounds. Authorities were investigating. The Cole investigation was taking place under tight security in this city of 800,000 squeezed between the sea and a range of jagged hills. Yemeni soldiers were posted outside the hotel where most U.S. investigators and their Marine guards were staying. Inside, the Marines carried automatic rifles and closely monitored anyone coming in. The ship, a white cloth billowing over the gaping hole ripped into the hull by the blast, sat isolated in an inner area of the harbor on a hot, sunny Saturday morning. The survivors remained on board. Two other Navy ships _ the frigate USS Hawes and the destroyer USS Donald Cook _ were sent to help the Cole and its crew. ``Obviously, the crew left on the USS Cole is tired and distraught,'' Defense Department spokesman Kenneth Bacon told reporters in Washington Friday. ``And so the crews of the new ships can help do some of the work that's required to keep the ship afloat and to deal with the damage to the hull.'' Bacon said the Cole was stable, some power has been restored and Navy divers found the keel in good shape. The Cole is a $1 billion guided missile destroyer. It was heading with a crew of about 293 to the Gulf to support the U.N. embargo against Iraq. There have been no claims of responsibility for the blast that have gained widespread credibility. One U.S. official said this reflected a trend among militant groups not to claim responsibility for attacks in order to elude intelligence gathering. However, Omar Bakri Mohammed, a leader of Al-Muhajiroun, a London-based Arab militant group, said Friday he had received an international call claiming responsibility for the attack on the American ship. It was in the name of ``Muhammad's Army,'' an extremist group previously known to be active only in the Chechnya and Dagestan, in Russia. Bakri, who is known to have ties to terror suspect Osama bin Laden, said he was skeptical of the claim but some of his skepticism waned after Friday's bombing at the British Embassy because the group promised more attacks in its call Thursday. Meanwhile, a close associate of bin Laden urged Muslims worldwide to attack U.S. and Israeli targets to avenge the deaths of Palestinians killed in bloody and protracted clashes with Israel. Ayman el Zawahri, who was found guilty in absentia of the 1981 assassination of Egyptian President Anwar Sadat, faxed his call for ``jihad,'' or holy war, to the Islamabad bureau of the Abu Dhabi channel of the United Arab Emirates Television, bureau chief Jamal Ismael said. Islamic extremists have been active in Yemen. However, Yemen's Prime Minister Abdul-Karim al-Iryani said in March that bin Laden, at one time had ``colleagues'' in Yemen but now ``has no place in Yemen, no military camps.'' The United States accuses bin Laden of organizing a network with followers across the Mideast, including Yemen, and says he masterminded the 1998 bombings of U.S. embassies in Africa that killed 224 people.

Thirty-nine sailors wounded in the attack on a U.S. Navy ship in Yemen arrived Saturday in Germany for treatment at a military hospital, a midway station on their journey home. Hours later, another plane left Germany for the United States carrying the bodies of five sailors killed in the bombing. The caskets were headed for the Dover Air Force Base in Dover, Del. Services were planned for later in the day at Dover and at the Norfolk Naval Base in Virginia, home port of the stricken USS Cole. Of the first planeload of 28 sailors who arrived in Germany before dawn, seven were too badly wounded to walk and were carried from the plane on stretchers at Rhein-Main Air Base outside Frankfurt. Many of the 21 walking wounded were still wearing shorts and T-shirts, and wrapped themselves in blankets against the chilly fog as they descended from the plane that had carried them on a 15-hour trip from Aden, Yemen. Some had bandages around their heads; two had eye bandages and four or five with bandaged limbs hopped on one foot without the aid of crutches. They appeared stunned and exhausted as they filed past a small group of reporters on to a waiting bus. The seven stretchers were loaded gingerly on to a bus for the 1 1/2 hour drive to the U.S. military's Landstuhl Regional Medical Center. ``These guys were just exhausted,'' said Capt. Karin Petersen, one of five flight nurses from the 86th Medical Air Evacuation Wing based at Ramstein who, along with a surgeon and other medical personnel, accompanied the wounded. ``They just wanted us to take them home.'' A second group of 11 more seriously wounded sailors arrived later Saturday on a flight to Ramstein and were being brought to Landstuhl. That group had departed from the east African nation of Djibouti, their first point of evacuation after the attack. Military doctors at Landstuhl said the injuries among the first group appeared minor. Most had cuts and bruises, some had broken bones and a few had eye injuries, said deputy director Col. James Rundell. One sailor had a ruptured eardrum and another a dislocated shoulder, he said. Some were expected to need counseling to deal with the mental trauma of the attack, Rundell said. ``At this point, it's hard to tell the difference between being dazed and being tired,'' he told a news conference at Landstuhl, speaking of the first group who arrived. ``Our focus today is to get the patients in the hospital stabilized and their treatment begun.'' Landstuhl director Col. Elder Granger paid tribute to the 25 men and three women. ``My condolences go out to the families of these great Americans, America's sons and daughters, who are serving their country in the name of democracy and defense,'' Granger said. ``The most important thing is that we want to make sure they are safe.'' The C9 medical transport originally was headed for Ramstein Air Base, less than two miles from the Landstuhl military hospital, but had to divert to Rhein-Main because of fog. Before the weather changed, the bodies of five sailors killed in the attack on the Cole arrived Friday evening at Ramstein on their way back to the United States. Light rain fell as an Air Force honor guard silently transferred the caskets draped in U.S. flags from an Air Force jet into separate hearses. Sailors from the Sigonella air base in Sicily stood at attention on the tarmac alongside airmen in dress blues during the ceremony. Flags flew at half staff at the base in western Germany. As the caskets were driven away to the nearby Landstuhl, the clouds receded and the setting sun cast a red and yellow reflection across the wet tarmac. The United States says 17 sailors died and 33 were injured in the explosion on the USS Cole while it was refueling in the Yemeni port of Aden. Seven bodies have so far been recovered. The blast tore a hole 40 feet high and 40 feet wide at the ship's waterline. U.S. officials say suicide bombers blew up a small boat next to the destroyer.

President Clinton, encouraged by the breakthrough in efforts to bring Palestinians and Israelis together for peace talks, was awaiting word from Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak on convening a summit, White House officials said Saturday. ``It's obviously very promising and the president will be in touch with leaders in the region today as we travel to the West Coast,'' White House Press Secretary Jake Siewert told reporters. ``What we are going to do is reach out to President Mubarak who ... has been working to arrange the summit.'' Clinton, who planned a political trip to Denver and Seattle, has been working for the last eight days to end the crisis in the Middle East and find those responsible for the apparent terrorist attack Thursday on a U.S. warship in Yemen that killed 17 American sailors. He canceled a political trip to Missouri and Arkansas on Friday and stayed at the White House to conduct telephone diplomacy with Mideast leaders. Aides said Clinton could travel to the region as early as Monday for a proposed summit intended to end the violence and get peace negotiations back on track. ``The summit has been proposed by Mubarak. We're awaiting word from President Mubarak as to whether he feels the conditions are in place to convene a summit,'' an administration aide said, speaking on the condition of anonymity. Mubarak said he would host talks in the resort town of Sharm el-Sheikh ``as long as it serves the Palestinian interest,'' the Middle East News Agency reported. Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, who had been refusing to take part until Israel vowed to stop firing at Palestinian demonstrators at flashpoints in the West Bank and Gaza, agreed early Saturday to attend. U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan was in touch with Clinton and Secretary of State Madeline Albright during the night and said the peace talks could be convened Sunday or Monday without preconditions. ``We are encouraged by what Kofi Annan has said,'' the White House aide said. The president worked late Friday night to break the Mideast stalemate, but took a break shortly after 9 p.m. EDT to call those gathered in Little Rock, Ark., for a Democratic fund-raiser. He told them he remained hopeful for a breakthrough. Eds: Following 2 grafs embargoed for 10:06 a.m. EDT use ``Ending the violence and getting people of the Middle East back to dialogue will be hard after what has happened,'' Clinton said Saturday in his weekly radio address. ``But no matter how difficult that task may be, no matter how terrible the images of this week's violence, the effort must continue with America's strong support.'' On the explosion that ripped a gash in the USS Cole, he said: ``We will do whatever it takes, for as long as it takes, to find those who killed our sailors and hold them accountable. ... For only by defending our people, our interests and our values will we redeem the lives of our sailors and ruin the schemes of their killers.'' End embargoed material On Friday, the president spoke by telephone three times to Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Abdullah. He also called U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, King Mohammed VI of Morocco, British Prime Minister Tony Blair and Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak. Clinton also talked to Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh about Thursday's explosion that tore a hole in the side of the USS Cole. Additionally, he spoke with Adm. Vernon Clark, the chief of naval operations; Adm. Robert Natter, commander in chief of the US Atlantic Fleet; Vice Adm. Charles Moore, commander of the 5th Fleet; and Cmdr. Kirk Lippold, commanding officer of the Cole. Vice President Al Gore, meanwhile, interrupted his presidential campaign to attend a two-hour National Security Council meeting where Clinton was briefed on the volatile situation in the Middle East and the attack on the U.S. Navy destroyer. Attorney General Janet Reno and FBI Director Louis Freeh were also at the meeting. ``Even if the violence stops it will be very difficult to move on to the negotiating table immediately,'' Siewert said. ``Some sort of cooling-off period needs to occur before they can sit down and work through their differences.''

As the American military figures out how to repair the bomb-damaged warship USS Cole, it also will ponder whether security policies need to be fixed as well. The Navy was concentrating mainly on restoring power and communications aboard the guided missile destroyer, recovering the bodies of missing sailors in the flooded ship and helping the crew's relatives back home. At the explosion site in Yemen, repair crews surveyed damage caused by the apparent terrorist bombing that took 17 lives and investigators worked to determine those responsible for the attack. The White House said President Clinton plans to attend memorial services on Wednesday in Norfolk, Va., the ship's home port. ``He will pay tribute to the sailors who lost their lives serving their country,'' White House Press Secretary Jake Siewert said Saturday. At the Pentagon, officials said the explosion is certain to lead to a review of whether ships in foreign ports should tighten security procedures and whether Yemen's main port, Aden, should still be used as a ship refueling stop. ``Every tragedy like this provokes a period of reflection,'' Defense Department spokesman Kenneth Bacon told reporters Friday. ``And there will certainly be review and reflection after this one, and we will look at our security procedures.'' The Navy also will rethink the way in which it contracts with local harbor authorities for the kind of help it required in Aden, Bacon said. Harbor boats were assisting the Cole attach mooring lines at a fuel facility in the middle of the harbor Thursday when one of the boats pulled alongside the warship and apparently detonated a bomb. Bacon said the Navy already began its investigation of the incident. ``I'm sure there will be other reviews in the coming days, and I think we'll be able to announce something soon,'' he said. Following initial damage assessments, the rest of a team of several dozen divers, engineers and other experts was to arrive at Aden in the next few days to determine exactly what is wrong with the Cole _ its hull, main structures, drive shafts and so on, said Navy spokesman Cmdr. Greg Smith. The team will recommend to the Pentagon ways the ship might be repaired enough to move, and where it might be moved to, Smith said. ``I would expect in the next week or so they will be able to ... know what they have to do to fix it, and perhaps even have completed the repairs enough to move it to a more substantial facility,'' said Bacon. Officials did not estimate how long it might take to return the 4-year-old, $1 billion Cole to the fleet and how much it might cost. Its main damage is a 40-by-40-foot hole at its waterline and the destruction and flooding of one of its two engine rooms. Two other Navy ships _ the frigate USS Hawes and the destroyer USS Donald Cook _ were sent to help the Cole and its crew. ``Obviously, the crew left on the USS Cole is tired and distraught,'' Bacon said. ``And so the crews of the new ships can help do some of the work that's required to keep the ship afloat and to deal with the damage to the hull. So it's important that they have reinforcements there.'' In other developments Friday: _ Officials began bringing the casualties home, flying some to Germany for flights on to the United States. _ A memorial service was planned for Wednesday in the Cole's home port of Norfolk, Va. _ The Navy released the names of the dead and missing. All but one were from the enlisted ranks. Two were women, the first time a female sailor has been killed in hostile action aboard a U.S. combat ship. _ The State Department announced it was closing many of its embassies and consulates for the weekend as a security precaution. That included all posts in the Middle East, the Persian Gulf region and North Africa as well as some posts in other parts of Africa.

A team of FBI agents, U.S. Navy investigators and other anti-terrorist experts arrived in this port city on the southern tip of the Arabian peninsula on Saturday to reinforce the probe into the explosion aboard the destroyer Cole that killed 17 U.S. sailors and wounded more than 30 others, at least five of them critically, aboard one of the Navy's most sophisticated warships. The investigation into what Washington has tentatively described as a terrorist act was bolstered with the arrival of a 40-member squad from the federal emergency support team, a Washington-based unit that draws experts from different government agencies. They joined a score of other experts who flew in earlier from bases in Europe and elsewhere in the Middle East, including the headquarters of the Navy's Fifth Fleet in Bahrain in the Persian Gulf. Over the weekend, the U.S. investigation team is expected to grow to more than 100, including personnel from the CIA and defense intelligence agencies. The investigation is focusing on the theory that a team of suicide bombers, possibly belonging to an Islamic terrorist group, attacked the Navy destroyer in a well-planned operation that used the cover of a mooring operation in Aden harbor to dash in among a flotilla of support vessels. Witnesses have described two men in a motorized rubber dinghy racing to the port side of the Navy ship and standing erect at the moment the blast occurred. If confirmed as the work of terrorists, the attack would be one of the bloodiest single incidents in years, and the worst against Americans in the Middle East since a truck-bombing of a military barracks in Saudi Arabia that killed 19 U.S. servicemen in June 1996. Federal investigators said Saturday that an analysis had indicated that the attackers used at least 440 pounds of high explosives, about a fifth of a ton. They said the hole caused by the blast at the Cole's waterline was about 80 feet wide and almost as deep, far larger than initial reports suggested. As the destroyer sat listing in Aden's inner harbor on Saturday, in blazing 100-degree heat, the Pentagon announced new measures suggesting that it remained deeply concerned about conditions aboard the ship, and possibly about further terrorist attacks. The announcement said the Fifth Fleet had ordered two other Navy ships, the frigate Hawes and the destroyer Donald Cook, to join the Cole in Aden as soon as possible ``so the crews of the new ships can help do some of the work that's required to keep the ship afloat and to deal with the damage to the hull,'' according to Kenneth Bacon, a Pentagon spokesman. The reinforcements were approaching Aden at midafternoon, close enough for helicopters to begin shuttling Navy officials to the incoming ships, and they were expected to be in the port by nightfall to bolster the support and protection that were already in place around the Cole. Throughout the night and into the day, Yemeni patrol boats could be seen in the harbor, and a British frigate, the Marlborough, remained moored alongside the Cole in what British and U.S. officials said was a move by Britain's Royal Navy to assist the U.S. destroyer and the surviving members of its 293-strong crew. Reporters' requests to visit the Cole continued to be deferred. The Navy said it wanted no distractions from the probe, which included diving operations below the Cole's waterline and down to the harbor floor, to determine the extent of the damage to the ship, and to search for the remains, if any, of the 10 sailors of the 17 killed who were still listed as missing. The bodies of five of the seven crew members who were found after the blast were scheduled to arrive aboard a military transport plane in Dover, Del., on Saturday, after being flown from Aden to Ramstein Air Base in Germany. For the crew still aboard the Cole, conditions appeared to be highly uncomfortable. Many were sleeping under awnings stretched across the upper decks after the blast filled many of the vessel's compartments and its engine room with water, rendering the ship's engines unusable and stripping the vessel of air conditioning. Large shipments of bottled water flown from Bahrain, as well as emergency food supplies, were being shuttled to the ship by tenders. During the day, the Navy announced that in addition to the 33 crew members originally listed as wounded, another six were evacuated on Friday to a U.S. military hospital at Landstuhl, Germany, suffering from what Lt. Terrence Dudley, a Navy spokesman, described as ``post-traumatic stress.'' All of the wounded were out of the Aden hospital that gave them initial treatment by Friday, airlifted directly to Germany or to a French military hospital in neighboring Djibouti. By Friday night, the casualties in Djibouti had also been flown to Germany. Although Navy spokesmen have said that there is no danger of the Cole sinking, there seemed little doubt that the billion-dollar warship, one of the United States' newest and most sophisticated warships, was severely damaged. Dudley said that much of the recovery crew's effort had gone into pumping water out of the flooded compartments, and to investigating ways of patching the hole caused by the blast, part of which was below the waterline. This would enable sailors to get the ship to dockside, in Aden or elsewhere, where more elaborate repairs could be made that would allow the Cole to be towed back to its home port of Norfolk, Va. With officials in Washington having said on Friday that they had no firm leads on which group carried out the attack, U.S. officials in Aden stressed the thoroughness of the investigation. The team that arrived overnight from Washington will remain in Aden ``as long as it takes,'' Dudley said, adding, ``Nothing will be left untouched.'' Apart from the difficult conditions in the port, where the Cole is moored about three-quarters of a mile from the harborside, requiring all equipment and supplies to be ferried out by tenders, the investigators are working in a highly charged political atmosphere. Yemen's president, Ali Abdullah Saleh, a former army general who runs this nation of almost 18 million people largely as a personal fiefdom, has continued to imply that the U.S. version of the explosion is wrong, and that it resulted from an accident aboard the Cole, not a terrorist attack. Yemen's official SABA news agency, reporting Saturday on a telephone conversation on Friday night between Saleh and President Clinton, quoted Saleh as telling the U.S. leader that both countries must avoid ``a wrong analysis'' of the cause of the blast. Although SABA did not say what Saleh meant, the Yemeni leader has maintained since the explosion that it was ``not a deliberate act,'' and that reports reaching him from his own security agencies have indicated that the blast occurred inside the Cole. Navy spokesmen here have refuted this version, saying that all their evidence shows that the blast, which they say occurred at 9:30 a.m. local time on Thursday (2:30 a.m. EDT), happened when the unidentified rubber boat maneuvered between other support vessels assisting the Cole with mooring, refueling and garbage-removal operations, and raced to the Cole's port side. ``It was an unfortunate circumstance that was not foreseen,'' Dudley said on Friday, after outlining the ``high alert'' precautions _ including posting crewmen to watch for unidentified craft _ that he said were routine during navy refueling stops here. He added: ``We do know that there was a large explosion that was external to our vessel, and that it left our ship with fairly extensive damage.'' Saleh, the Yemeni leader, has remained at his presidential mansion in the lee of Cape Aden, a 2,000-foot volcanic mountain that overlooks the harbor, since visiting injured U.S. crewmen in an Aden hospital on Thursday. Despite his suggestion that the blast was an accident, he has been at pains to promise that Yemen will cooperate with the U.S. investigation and ``hunt down'' the perpetrators if terrorist involvement is proved. U.S. officials here say the Yemeni leader has abided by this undertaking, offering all the help requested, and waiving Yemeni laws and regulations to allow large numbers of U.S. military and intelligence officials to operate with few restrictions. This cooperation has extended to allowing a 40-man Marine anti-terrorist squad deployed from Bahrain to patrol inside a government-owned harborside hotel where most of the U.S. team members are staying, wearing desert-style camouflage uniforms and carrying automatic rifles. The Marines also act as bodyguards for investigators shuttling to the harborside. In a country that bans foreigners from using satellite telephones, the Americans have set up sophisticated communications transmitters on the hotel roof, and posted Marines to protect them.

federal investigators are trying to determine who is responsible for the attack on the "uss cole." carl rochelle has more. fbi investigators and other u.s. investigators are on the scene in yemen trying to determine who was responsible for the explosion that damaged the "uss cole," the guided missile destroyer. one of the things they are looking at is a fax that came from an organization to news organizations in beirut, the group calling itself, the "group of martyrs of the intifada of the al axam mosque" affiliated with the islamic deterrent forces. that group is claiming responsibility, but officials say they are not ruling out any other groups at this point, including the osama bin laden terrorist organization, that has pointed itself toward u.s. interests around the world. defense secretary william cohen says finding out who was responsible is a top priority. we are at least working on the assumption that this was a boat loaded with some high explosives, that approached the ship and caused extensive damage. again, we don't want to reach a final judgment yet, but it appears to be an act of terrorism. and that's what we're going to pursue with all of our intelligence community to see exactly what took place, identify individuals if it was a group or individual terrorists. we are going to identify them, and track them down and hold them fully accountable. while investigators try to determine who was responsible for the terrorist bomb against the "uss cole," navy divers continue to look at the ship. navy repair crews to try to determine what needs to be done to get it ready to go back to the united states. the divers discovered when they went in the water that the hole was larger than earlier believed, 40 feet by 40 feet. officials say it likely would have been 400 to 500 pounds of explosives that caused such an extensive damage to the ship. i'm carl rochelle, cnn, at the pentagon.

The New York Times said in an editorial for Sunday, Oct. 15: Two global flash points, the Middle East and the Balkans, have been in the spotlight in recent weeks for different reasons. Now comes a reminder from Oslo _ in the form of a Nobel Peace Prize _ of encouraging signs in another of the world's most enduring trouble spots. President Kim Dae-jung of South Korea has been awarded the prize for his efforts to secure peace and reconciliation on the Korean peninsula. The 76-year-old Kim, improbably elected president in 1997, is a worthy recipient. As a dissident during the years of Seoul's military dictatorship, Kim struggled courageously for human rights and democracy before assuming the presidency. It is only fitting that one of the heroes of democracy's triumph in South Korea is striving to bring lasting peace to the entire peninsula. The award came a day after the United States and North Korea pledged to ``fundamentally improve'' their relations. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright announced plans to visit President Kim Il Jong of North Korea in Pyongyang soon, and her visit may pave the way for a subsequent visit by the president. President Clinton will embark on a historic trip to Vietnam in November, and a stop in North Korea would give an added flourish to Clinton's last months in office. In its citation to Kim Dae-jung, the Nobel committee alluded to the contributions made by North Korea and other countries to advance reconciliation and possible reunification on the Korean peninsula. Clinton deserves some of the credit. His administration has adroitly made overtures to North Korea's communist regime while insisting that it give up efforts to develop nuclear weapons. At home, Kim Dae-jung's cultivation of Pyongyang has not always been popular. But this year it has paid impressive dividends. He held the first-ever summit with his North Korean counterpart in June. The two countries have since agreed to rebuild the rail link between them, arranged short family reunions for relatives separated for a half-century and marched together in the opening ceremonies of the Sydney Olympic Games. The thaw could not have been possible, to be sure, without a dramatic attitudinal shift on the part of North Korea, which not long ago seemed intent on dragging the peninsula into another war. But serious issues remain to be resolved, such as Pyongyang's program to develop intercontinental missiles. Washington and Seoul must now ascertain whether the thaw is merely an opportunistic gambit by Kim Il Jong to attract economic aid or a fundamental attempt to overcome the past.

With the wounded safe and the bodies of the 17 dead sailors headed home for burial, attention turned in full force Saturday to determining whether it was terrorists who attacked the USS Cole as it sat in a Yemeni harbor. Lt. Terrence Dudley, a U.S. Navy spokesman in Aden, said 40 FBI agents and Department of Defense specialists from Washington's Foreign Emergency Support Team arrived in the city Saturday, joining a few experts already in place. Their mission: ``advise, assist and assess'' a probe that began almost immediately after the explosion Thursday, Dudley said. So far, investigators have worked to secure what U.S. officials increasingly believe is a terrorist crime scene. Divers were examining the hull. More than 100 FBI evidence and explosives experts, including those in the group that arrived Saturday, were expected in Aden by the end of the weekend. Yemen almost immediately rejected U.S. claims that terrorism was behind Thursday's explosion, and the Foreign Ministry repeated Saturday that it ``does not accept the presence of terrorists on its territories.'' Nonetheless, U.S. officials believe it was suicide bombers who blew up a small boat next to the 8,600-ton destroyer, ripping a 40-by-40-foot hole at the water line. Western diplomats in Yemen said the explosion seemed to be the work of a well-organized group with good connections in the port of Aden. If terrorism is proven, it would be the deadliest such attack on the U.S. military since the bombing of an Air Force barracks in Saudi Arabia in 1996 that killed 19. Thirty-nine 39 Cole sailors were flown for treatment and evaluation to the U.S. military's Landstuhl Regional Medical Center in Germany. Some were taken to Germany after first stopping at a French military hospital in the east African nation of Djibouti. The Navy had earlier said 33 sailors were wounded. Dudley said Saturday that six additional sailors required treatment for post-traumatic stress. About 20 injured crew members now in Germany were scheduled to return to the Cole's home port of Norfolk, Va., this weekend, said Cmdr. Beci Brenton in Norfolk. The bodies of those killed aboard the Cole were also flown first to Germany. A plane carrying the bodies of the first five to be recovered left Germany for the United States on Saturday, a military spokesman said. Services were planned later in the day at Dover air base in Delaware and at the Norfolk Naval Base in Virginia. The Navy released the names of the 17 dead on Friday. All but one were from the enlisted ranks and two were women _ the first female sailors killed in hostile action aboard a U.S. combat ship. The Cole explosion came as anti-Western sentiment ran high in Yemen and elsewhere in the Arab world, with protesters condemning the United States, particularly during demonstrations against Israel's use of force in two weeks of deadly clashes in Jerusalem and the Palestinian territories. More than 200 miles from Aden in the capital, San`a, an explosion on Friday rocked the British Embassy. Windows shattered but nobody was hurt. Britain's foreign secretary said a bomb may have been flung into embassy grounds. Authorities were investigating. Saturday's statement from the Yemeni Foreign Ministry defended the country's record of combatting terrorism. The strongly worded statement also defended Yemenis and government officials who have protested the treatment of Palestinians in Israel, the West Bank and Gaza. The protests have ``nothing to do with American-Yemeni relations'' and express not only Yemeni sentiment but that of ``the world's conscience,'' the ministry said. There have been no credible claims of responsibility for the blast. One U.S. official said that reflects a trend among militant groups. To elude intelligence-gathering, many have not been claiming responsibility for their attacks. Among the names mentioned in the wake of the bombing has been Osama bin Laden: The United States accuses bin Laden of organizing a network with followers across the Mideast, including Yemen, and says he masterminded the 1998 bombings of U.S. embassies in Africa that killed 224 people. Islamic extremists have been active in Yemen. However, Yemeni Prime Minister Abdul-Karim al-Iryani said in March that bin Laden, who at one time had ``colleagues'' in Yemen, now ``has no place in Yemen, no military camps.'' The Cole had been heading with a crew of about 293 to the Gulf to support the U.N. embargo against Iraq when it was bombed. The Cole survivors remained aboard, and the Navy said the $1 billion guided missile destroyer would be repaired and stay in service. Two other Navy ships _ the frigate USS Hawes and the destroyer USS Donald Cook _ were sent to help the Cole and its crew. ``Obviously, the crew left on the USS Cole is tired and distraught,'' Defense Department spokesman Kenneth Bacon told reporters in Washington on Friday. ``And so the crews of the new ships can help do some of the work that's required to keep the ship afloat and to deal with the damage to the hull.'' Bacon said the Cole was stable, some power had been restored and Navy divers found the keel in good shape. Saturday was the 33rd anniversary of independence from Britain for what was once South Yemen, now part of United Yemen. The anniversary is usually festive, particularly in Aden, once the South Yemeni capital. But marches and gatherings were banned Saturday in a city under tight security. The ban on celebrations added to the frustrations of Aden fishermen, some of whom have been unable to take their boats out because of the security around the Cole.

The 39 U.S. sailors injured in the attack on a Navy ship in Yemen spent Saturday at a hospital in this idyllic corner of Germany _ some weeping, some taking to their beds in exhaustion, all remembering their 17 shipmates who didn't make it out. The sailors arrived earlier Saturday at the Landstuhl Regional Medical Center, the U.S. military hospital here, many for a one-day stay before heading back to the United States. They came to Germany in two planeloads _ an initial 28 with mostly minor injuries, followed by another 11 who were more seriously hurt. ``They were definitely in shock,'' said Navy Lt. James Glaspie, one of 11 military chaplains at the medical center to counsel the survivors. Several sailors broke into tears when they called their families back home after arriving at the hospital, chaplains said. Many just wanted to sleep. Two days earlier, the sailors were witness to the explosion that claimed their colleagues: The 17 men and women died when a blast tore a hole in the side of their ship, the USS Cole, while it refueled in the Yemeni port of Aden. U.S. officials believe the attack was the work of suicide bombers who blew up a small boat next to the destroyer. ``Some of them are still going through some emotional trauma from the death of their fellow sailors,'' hospital director Col. Elder Granger said of the wounded. One young sailor with severe leg injuries told chaplains he fought to survive, clambering up a ladder as water poured into the ship. His wife was pregnant and ``he wanted to see the baby,'' Glaspie said. He said a young woman officer _ the sole officer among the injured _ was tormented by having to leave those under her command behind. ``She was more concerned about her people than about herself,'' Glaspie said. Granger said 34 of the injured were cleared to return home Sunday, while five others would stay longer to be treated for serious injuries _ one with a punctured lung, another with burns to face and hands, and three with multiple broken bones. All were in stable condition, he said. Landstuhl is set amid rolling hills and fir forests near the French border. The hospital has often served as a way station for injured American military personnel on their way home. On Saturday, U.S. and German flags flew at half-staff at the entrance. Officials refused to identify the sailors and kept them isolated from the media, explaining that many had indicated they were still too distressed to talk in public. Before heading to the hospital, the wounded landed early Saturday at Rhein-Main Air Base outside Frankfurt. Many in the first group to arrive still wore shorts and T-shirts, wrapping themselves in blankets against the chilly fog as they descended from the C9 medical transport that had carried them on a 15-hour trip from Aden, Yemen. Some had bandages around their heads. Two had eye bandages, and four or five with bandaged limbs hopped on one foot without the aid of crutches. Not long after, another military transport left Ramstein to bring home the bodies of five of the sailors killed in the bombing. The caskets later arrived at the air force base in Dover, Del.

sailors injured in the bombing of the "uss cole" are on their way back to the united states for rest and medical treatment. as they recover, they are giving horrific accounts of the attack. chris burns reports. bandaged and sometimes limping, most managed to walk to the plane. some signaled they were in good spirits, as they boarded the c-141 for the final trip home. the injuries were more apparent on others. some were far too injured to walk at all. the c-141 lifted off, leaving behind six other sailors of the "uss cole," four men and two women at nearby landstuhl u.s. medical center. they were the worst hurt, some recovering from surgery a day earlier. all were out of intensive care, and one was taken off a ventilator. the other person who is still on the ventilator, and who is seriously injured, has multiple fractures of both lower legs, ankle, a foot, both wrists, and has also had some abdominal injuries. meanwhile, four of the sailors' families quietly arrived at landstuhl in the morning. the other two were expected on monday. officials here said the injured sailors still declined to be interviewed. a navy source said they were not pressured to remain silent, despite reported concerns that sailors' accounts could compromise the blast investigation. but chaplains who spoke with the sailors heard some dramatic stories, including one from a man who struggled to keep from drowning. the water started rise ing, and he started thinking about his wife, who is pregnant with a child, a daughter. and he just thought about how he wanted to see them again. chaplains also say they heard little anger or bitterness from the sailors about the blast, and no debate over whether the "uss cole" should have been off adden in the first place. but the chaplains acknowledge that could change, as the sailors begin to regain their strength. chris burns, cnn, at ramstein air base, germany. president clinton's national security adviser is defending the use of the yemeni port of aden for refueling u.s. ships. samuel berger says there are few places in the persian gulf where ships can refuel and calls the whole region "a high threat area." he says so far, investigators have not identified specific suspects in the attack. well, there's an inquiry that the defense department has undertaken to look at what happened in this circumstance, whether any further measures were required. i assume we will look at the larger question of whether we should continue to refuel there. but, you know, we've refueled there 25 times in the last 18 months. this is a high risk, high threat area, the middle east. and we do have to have refueling in ports. and in all of these countries, there is a degree of risk. we just have to make sure that we've taken every measure possible to diminish that risk. that blast went off as two men in a small boat pulled up alongside the 505 foot destroyer. the pentagon says preliminary evidence indicates the attackers used 400 to 500 pounds of explosives to blow a foot hole in the hull.

President Clinton's national security adviser on Sunday defended the Navy's decision to dock ships in Yemen, where a suspected terrorist blast killed 17 sailors aboard the USS Cole. Sandy Berger said limited fueling options in the Persian Gulf require such stops despite the high risk of terrorism. ``This entire area is a high threat area. The military has taken substantial steps in this area,'' he said on NBC's ``Meet the Press.'' He said 25 ships have refueled in the Arabian Peninsula port of Aden in the past 18 months ``without incident.'' ``Obviously we have to find out what if anything happened in this particular case,'' Berger said. U.S. officials believe the ship was the target of a suicide attack from a small vessel packed with powerful explosives. If terrorism is proved, it would be the deadliest such attack on the U.S. military since the bombing of an Air Force barracks in Saudi Arabia in 1996 that killed 19. ``I think it's quite clear that it was a terrorist act but we at this point have no clues as to who's responsible,'' Berger said. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said on ABC's ``This Week'' that she thinks the inquiry is ``moving'' and the United States is ``getting a lot of people in there.'' Among the names mentioned in the wake of the bombing has been Osama bin Laden. The United States accuses bin Laden of organizing a network with followers across the Mideast, including Yemen, and says he masterminded the 1998 bombings of U.S. embassies in east Africa that killed 224 people. President Clinton, in a letter Saturday to Republican congressional leaders, said more than 100 military personnel, plus two Navy warships, were sent to Yemen to help with security, communications and medical needs. Berger said the Defense Department is investigating whether future ships will continue to refuel in the area. ``We need to wait for a very thorough review and determine if anything more could have been done and should have been done,'' he said. Aden's convenient deep-water port had been used as a refueling point for U.S. warships for about two years. Discussions also had been started on a possible permanent U.S. facility around Aden _ near the southwestern tip of the Arabian Peninsula and near the important straits at the southern end of the Red Sea.

The Pentagon on Sunday suspended all naval refueling operations in Yemen until officials determine whether lax security in the port at Aden left the U.S. destroyer Cole vulnerable to a presumed bombing attack that killed 17 sailors and wounded more than three dozen others. The security at the port _ and with the private contractor that oversaw the refueling _ has become a focus of the widening investigation into what officials have called a suicide attack. Since the attack is believed to have involved a harbor boat helping the Cole moor at a refueling site in Aden's port, officials say they believe that those involved skillfully infiltrated the port's operations or the contractor itself. In addition to a criminal inquiry led by the FBI, the Navy and the Department of Defense have begun separate investigations into how a small harbor boat packed with explosives could have managed to blow a gaping hole in one of the Navy's most sophisticated warships, senior officials said Sunday. ``We will find out through this inquiry as to whether there was any laxity, any failure to measure up to the very highest standards that we insist upon for force protection,'' Secretary of Defense William Cohen said in an interview on the CBS-News program ``Face the Nation.'' The Pentagon on Sunday identified the company hired to provide fuel to visiting U.S. warships as Arab Investment Manufacturing and Trading Co. Ltd., which is based in Aden. The company's role, along with that of Aden's government-run port agency, is one subject of the FBI's investigation, officials said. A Pentagon spokesman, Lt. Col. Paul S. Phillips, said the contract for refueling _ negotiated between the company and a division of the Defense Logistics Agency _ did not specify the company's responsibilities for security of operations at the port. It did, however, detail responsibilities for the company's own facilities, like requiring a fence around its pipelines to the harbor, Phillips said. Pentagon officials also revised some of the details about the refueling visits. On Sunday they said two dozen U.S. warships had stopped to refuel in Aden since the Navy began using the facilities there in early 1999 _ double the 12 visits that officials had originally cited. The extent to which the company had been vetted was not clear. And U.S. officials in Washington and in Yemen continued to provide conflicting accounts of which U.S. agency, if any, oversaw the company's security, as well as that of the port itself. ``We'll have to see whether or not anything more could have been done _ should have been done _ to prevent this,'' President Clinton's national security adviser, Sandy Berger, said on the NBC-News program ``Meet the Press.'' In Aden, U.S. investigators and forensic experts scoured the Cole for evidence that could be used to find those involved in an attack. Officials said investigators had found small fiberglass fragments on the Cole believed to be from the harbor boat that is thought to have exploded as it sidled up to the destroyer's port side. The officials said they now believed that the boat was 21 to 26 feet long and packed with several hundred pounds of high explosives. Investigators also found fragments of what seemed to be human flesh on the Cole's deck, perhaps the remains of two men who were seen standing on the boat in the moments before it apparently exploded. Berger, Cohen and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright defended the decision to use Aden as a refueling point despite concerns about security in a country that the State Department itself called ``a safe haven for terrorists'' earlier this year. ``For well over a decade, we've had a strong military presence in this region,'' Berger said. ``Now, if you're going to have a strong military presence, that means you're going to have to be dealing with some countries with whom we don't agree in all respects.'' For U.S. warships passing through the Suez Canal and the Red Sea on their way to operations in the Persian Gulf, the port in Aden is strategically situated, Berger and other officials said. They also said there were few alternatives. The architect of the plan to use the port, Gen. Anthony C. Zinni, who recently retired as the commander of U.S. forces in the region, said in an interview Sunday that Aden actually provided greater security than the alternatives. The reason, he said, was that Aden's port has a new refueling site in the middle of the harbor, which means that ships do not have to dock at a pier, where security is even harder to police. ``This was one of the best ports in the region security-wise,'' Zinni said. But others raised questions about the wisdom of using Aden, a dilapidated, bustling port with only a limited sense of law and order. ``Well, I think we should look at that very carefully,'' Sen. Trent Lott, the Republican majority leader, said on ``Meet the Press.'' ``I've been asking some questions about that,'' Lott said. ``Obviously it's a dangerous area. We should have reason to suspect that terrorism exists there and could affect our ships, but you know, I don't want to second-guess it at this point.''

The last time a top Chinese leader came to Japan, he lectured at every stop over the nation's past war crimes, demanding an apology. The visit quickly degenerated into a fuming, finger-pointing session that damaged relations between the two countries, Asia's most powerful. So there was a palpable sense of relief here this weekend when Prime Minister Zhu Rongji of China soft-pedaled the bitter question of Japan's conquest of his country in the 1930s as he made the rounds of official banquets and meetings with business groups and other Japanese. Zhu focused instead on economic and security issues whose resolution both countries say could bring them closer together. In a statement on his arrival on Thursday, Zhu said that cooperation between China and Japan was vital for the ``peace, stability and prosperity of the Asia-Pacific region,'' adding that he sought to ``promote mutual understanding and trust'' between them. There had been a nervous drumroll of speculation here for weeks about how Zhu would handle the subject of Japan's brutal colonial occupation. Many officials openly expressed hope that after the last bitter experience _ President Jiang Zemin's visit two years ago is still vividly recalled here _ the perennial sore point would not come up. Since Jiang's visit, a senior Japanese diplomat said, there had been a growing perception in Tokyo that China was using the war issue as a diplomatic weapon to cow Japan. ``They want us to do something to put this matter definitively behind us,'' the diplomat said. ``But we cannot put the issue to rest as long as it is being wielded against us.'' In the end, though, if Zhu let his hosts down by discussing the past, he did it so delicately as to all but remove the sting. In a long meeting with Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori, Zhu told him that China did not hold the Japanese people responsible for the war: ``Japanese people were also victims of Japanese militarism,'' he said. Later, at a town-hall type meeting with about 100 carefully chosen Japanese citizens, a relaxed and confident looking Zhu said that China still felt that Japan had never properly apologized for its war atrocities. But instead of scolding the audience, he said it was ``Japan's problem'' to decide how _ or indeed whether _ to atone for its past. ``But I hope you will consider it,'' he said. (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) The Chinese prime minister further disarmed his audience by saying that he had already faced questions at home for not raising the wartime issue with his hosts, or for not being sufficiently forthright about it ``Am I weak?'' he asked. After the meeting, many of the Japanese participants said that they had been deeply impressed. ``I imagined that he was really stern before I met him,'' said Kyosuke Kutrita, 27, an economics major at Hitotsubashi University in Tokyo. ``But talking with him, that image has gone away. He is so friendly and flexible, and he answered questions directly.'' (END OPTIONAL TRIM) If it is true that China feels genuine pain over Japan's wartime brutality, it is also true that the question has become a major feature of the diplomatic code language used during friction between two countries. One sure motive for China's friendlier face during the visit is the country's continuing need for economic aid and investment from Japan. Tokyo has provided about $24 billion in aid to China over the last two decades, according to the Japanese government. Japan, however, has grown increasingly uneasy over the rising power of China's armed forces, which consume a large and growing part of China's national budget, as China continues to seek aid from richer countries. Japan's anxiety about China's military ambitions has only been heightened in recent months by repeated incursions by Chinese surveillance ships into Japanese waters, and by the reluctance of China to engage in negotiations to delineate the territorial waters between the two countries clearly. ``If China becomes a major military power, the meaning of Japan's development assistance to China will surely come into question,'' the Yomiuri Shimbun, Japan's largest daily newspaper, said in an editorial about Zhu's visit. Japanese legislators, meanwhile, have cited the incursions and the specter of an increasingly menacing neighbor while threatening to block a pending $158 million aid package. Zhu sought to calm these concerns on his visit, saying that his country's ships had no hostile intent, and agreeing to set up a ``hot line'' between the two governments and a system of prior notification of ship movements into sensitive areas. Japanese diplomats say China's military assertiveness is not the only threat to economic aid. China has been unusually stingy, they say, in publicizing the details of Japan's aid to the Chinese people, raising suspicions that public opinion was being manipulated to sustain long-held Chinese suspicions toward Japan. On this score, too, Zhu promised to do better.

Thirty-three US sailors injured in the apparent terrorist attack that crippled the US navy destroyer Cole have returned to the United States after receiving medical treatment in Germany. They received an emotional greeting from family members who were brought to the Norfolk Navel Facility from all over the United States. Meanwhile, US officials vowed Sunday to be relentless in pursuing the perpetrators of Thursday's attack in the Yemeni port of Aden. Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral Vern Clark told the CBS broadcast 'Face the Nation' that US naval forces in the Middle East have now been reinforced. Security has been strengthened. We have additional security forces that have come to the ground. We have Admiral Mark Fitcher who is the task force Commander in there. We are bringing two or three additional ships into the region and they will be here within a next day or so. And so that on scene we are making great progress. But Defense Secretary William Cohen said investigators do not yet know who the culprits are.

Thirty-three US sailors injured in a deadly blast that left the USS Cole crippled in Yemen seaport Aden have come home. The sailors returned to the United States after receiving medical treatment in Germany. A military transport plane brought the injured sailors to their home base of Norfolk Virginia on Sunday where they received an emotional greeting from family members who were brought to the navy facility from all over the United States. Six more seriously injured shipmates stayed behind at Ramstein air force base in Germany for further treatment. Meanwhile, in Yemen scores of US forensic investigators have descended on Aden to begin probing Thursday's blast which killed 17 sailors aboard the guided missile destroyer as it docked to refuel. In a press briefing, the American Ambassador to Yemen Barbara Bodien commented on the explosion. All the evidence does point very clearly that the explosion came outside the ship. Now exactly who was behind it, what their motivation was and how they were able to arrange it that we can't speculate on, but certainly the explosion did come from outside the ship.

I'm Ray Kugell. This is VOA News now at one thirty six Universal time broadcasting from Washington. International reaction continues to be positive towards the democratic revolution in Yugoslavia led by Vojislav Kostunica while the democratic opposition of Serbia his 18 party coalition price to consolidate its power. The Serbian people toppled Slobodan Milosevic's government ten days ago when they took to the streets to protest an attempt to nullify the results of the September 24th presidential election. In Kosovo, the majority Albanian population who seek independence from Serbia refuse to participate in the election and they have voiced mixed reactions to the events of the past three weeks. Today's Dateline examines the subject of Kosovo in Yugoslavia's new government. Here is Judith Latham. Balkan analysts say the question of the future relationship between Kosovo and the new government in Belgrade is exceedingly complex. Although Kosovo's Serbs participated in the Yugoslav presidential elections, the majority Albanian population of Kosovo boycotted them and there are even reports that many Kosovo-Albanians secretly hoped Mr. Milosevic would win. Because, so long as an indited war criminal was President of Yugoslavia, they thought the international community might be more favorably disposed to an independent Kosovo some day. Despite Mr. Kostunica's reputation as a strong Serb nationalist, he is generally regarded as a democrat and is far more reasonable than his predecessor. Greg Sholty is Senior Director for Southeast European affairs at the National Security Council in Washington. He says Mr. Kostunica's public statements thus far have been encouraging. With respect to Kosovo, he made a statement where he recognized the commitments that Yugoslavia has taken with respect to Kosovo and . I think our conclusion is that in the long run having democratic reform in Belgrade is to the benefit of the people of Kosovo. And we're going to work with the people of Kosovo to build up democracy there to help them recover from the terrible campaign of ethnic cleansing that took place there and to help them build up institutions for a democratic self government. Greg Sholty, staff member of the National Security Council. Jim Hooper is Director of the Washington office of the International Crises Group, which is headquartered in Brussels. I talked with Mr. Hooper about the new Yugoslav President's views on Kosovo. On October the 9th Mr. Kostunica spoke with two reporters from The Washington Post and he expressed a fatalistic view about the future status of Kosovo and said, "We can imagine even Kosovo not being part of Serbia and we can imagine Kosovo being part of Serbia although not right now because of NATO's occupation." And what kind of accommodation might be possible? He is very eager, for example, for Serbs to be able to go back to Kosovo and live there in safety. Well, I think it's a legitimate concern to be worried about Kosovo Serbs and in The Washington Post interview, I believe Mr. Kostunica referred to his thinking about releasing some of the Kosovo-Albanians, there are almost a thousand of them held in Serbian jails, who were taken there at the end of the NATO bombing to get them out of Kosovo and that they have been political prisoners since then. I think this would be a very welcome gesture by the Kosovo-Albanians, if he did that. What he is asking, however, is that the authorities in Kosovo do provide information on missing Serbs. The reality of course is that the Kosovo-Albanians cannot imagine Kosovo being anyway a part of Serbia or a part of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. You know, there were a number of reports that quite a few Kosovo-Albanians were not entirely thrilled with the defeat of Mr. Milosevic because that seemed in some ways to weaken their case for independence, particularly with the international community. How do you see the response of the international community and particularly the United States to the Kosovor quest for independence given a more democratic government in Belgrade? I think the Kosovo Albanians are very concerned about the international community response to the unfolding events in Serbia. As long as Mr. Milosevic was there, no one in the West would even consider it that Kosovo might return to Serbia or the FRY, whether it was ruled by Milosevic, would be gone. With the Democrats in power their concern is that the support for their independence among the West is going to diminish and the international community will begin urging that they take a fresh look at the idea of possibly linking up to Serbia or the FRY. The departure of Milosevic was good news for everyone in the region except the Kosovars, at least that's how many Kosovo Albanians feel. Jim Hooper, Director of the Washington office of the International Crises Group. Louis Cell, Head of ICG's office in Pristina, says it's far better for Kosovo, the Balkans and the world as a whole that Slobodan Milosevic is no longer in power in Serbian. It's obviously going to be easier over the long run to achieve a peaceful and a stable solution in Kosovo and the Balkans without Milosevic there. Kostunica, a democratically elected leader of Serbia, is quite properly being included in international deliberation. The Kosovo Albanians, on the other hand, don't have their own government as they are under a UN protectorate, but there is no one with any legitimacy now in the eyes of the Kosovo Albanians who can represent their interest at least on matters of their future. On Kosovo, Kostunica has clearly expressed strong views. He believes that Kosovo, it is part of Serbia, that Serbian authority should return and at the most the Kosovo can expect for its future is the substantial economy. All of those things are utterly anathema and completely unacceptable to Kosovo Albanians. Mr. Cell says Mr. Kostunica's victory has forced the Kosovo Albanians to come to grips with their own lack of political power. That is, none of their leaders neither Ibrahim Rugova, nor Hashim Thaci has legitimacy in the eyes of the world. So it is essential that the Albanians create interim governmental institutions in Kosovo before discussing their future status with Belgrade. He says the Albanian community would be well advised to get its act together in terms of a leadership council after local elections scheduled for October 28th. On the other hand, he says the Serbs of Kosovo have been heartened by Mr. Kostunica's victory because they think there is a real chance what they regard as international occupation by the United Nations will end and Serb forces will then return to Kosovo. Louis Cell spoke with us by mobile phone from Pristina, where he has been monitoring recent events. Elier Jarcob, President of the National Albanian-American Council, says he is concerned that recent developments in Yugoslavia will shift international attention and development aid to the new government in Belgrade. I think for Albanians in Kosovo, the changes in Serbia will make things much more complicated. Eventually there will need to be some sort of discussion between Albanians in Kosovo and Serbs in Belgrade about a range of issues including the fate of political prisoners in Serbia, restitution to Kosovo for crimes committed there, what happens with war criminals who are roaming freely in Serbia itself, and then ultimately relationship between the two countries. I think that in the long term the changes in Serbia are beneficial to Albanians in Kosovo and to the Balkans in general. Elier Jarcob, President of the National Albanian-American Council, speaking with us from his office in Washington. Blair Michella, Editor of Pristina's daily newspaper, Zery, says Albanian political leaders in Kosovo have an important role to play in shaping any future relationship with the new government in Belgrade. The Albanian political leaders must support changes in Serbia. They should not fear democratization in Serbia, but on the other hand, they must resolutely and unanimously declare that self-determination for Kosovo will not be questioned, independently of who sits in the Serbian government. The issue of self-determination for Kosovo has not been, and cannot be a hostage of changes in Serbia. This is a necessary process for the long-term stabilization in the Balkans. Blair Michella, Editor of the Albanian language daily, Zery, speaking with VOA from Pristina. Kosovo and Yugoslavia's new government was the subject of today's Dateline. I'm Judith Latham.

A blast more powerful ``than just TNT'' buckled the USS Cole's deck and turned the attack boat into ``confetti size'' pieces that rained down on the crippled destroyer, officials said Sunday in accounts that shed light on the enormous devastation of the bombing. The details, provided by senior U.S. officials who spoke on condition of anonymity, also raised questions about the level of security in a port selected last year as a key refueling point for U.S. warships traveling between the Mediterranean and the Persian Gulf. There has been no credible claim of responsibility from Thursday's apparent suicide attack, which killed 17 sailors, wounded 39 others and punched a 40-by-40-foot chasm in the hull. Yemeni security forces have detained more than a dozen people for further questioning, but no arrests have been announced. It ranks as the deadliest terrorist attack on the U.S. military since the bombing of an Air Force barracks in Saudi Arabia in 1996 that killed 19. ``Now exactly who was behind it, what their motivation was and how they were able to arrange it, that we can't speculate on,'' said Barbara Bodine, the U.S. ambassador to Yemen. ``The ship has suffered a tremendous blow,'' said Rear Adm. Mark Fitzgerald, the military commander of the U.S. task force sent to the ship. On the listing deck of the Cole, crew members gathered for religious services and offered prayers for their dead shipmates _ some still wedged behind contorted metal below. A planned formal memorial was delayed because the crew worked through the night to control flooding after another bulk head collapsed, officials said. Also Sunday, the plane carrying 33 injured crew members landed at the Norfolk Naval Station in Norfolk, Va., while the other six injured remained hospitalized in Germany. The bodies of five of the sailors killed arrived back on United States soil on Saturday. Meanwhile, experts began scouring the ravaged ship in search of clues and the bodies of sailors still missing. Divers began searching water-filled compartments. Crews with powerful metal cutters will try to slice through the wreckage to reach bodies: two visible and 10 still missing and perhaps trapped behind floors and walls bent wildly by the blast. Terrorism and explosive experts combed through scenes described by a U.S. official as ``utter devastation.'' On the deck, ``confetti size'' pieces from the wooden attack boat were collected, the official said. Among the tasks for the investigators: looking for residue that could indicate the type of explosives. One of the officials said the power of the blast suggested ``more than just TNT'' _ which could suggest a well-organized and supplied group. The officials said the blast occurred shortly after the ship was secured to two buoys to begin refueling in the harbor, which was full of pleasure boats, fishing vessels and merchant ships. About two to three support vessels were around the Cole, including pilot craft and a garbage barge. There was no cry of alarm from the Cole's crew. Two people on the attack boat reportedly stood at attention briefly before the explosion. The blast at the waterline was close to the dining area for senior enlisted officers. Most hands were busy finishing the docking. A few minutes later, however, and the mess area would have started to fill. Immediately after the explosion, the ship began to fill with oily water from the 40-foot deep harbor. The ship listed under the weight of the flood. The impact wrenched open hatches and buckled parts of the deck on the 4-year-old destroyer, whose modern construction may have helped it say afloat. Power was lost and generators were used to pump out water and keep the Cole afloat. ``Heroic efforts were undertaken by the crew ... they saved the ship,'' said Fitzgerald. The U.S. Navy has ``blanket clearance'' to dock at Aden, where it keeps its own stockpile of fuel in cooperation with a private Yemeni company. Normally, a 48-hour advance notice is given of a ship's arrival. The information is passed on to Yemeni port authorities and the fuel agent, officials said. U.S. diplomats have insisted the Yemeni government is not suspected of any terrorists links. But security has been a key issue regarding Aden, the home base for an Islamic militant group founded by the brother of terrorist mastermind Osama bin Laden _ accused of links to the 1998 bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania that killed 224 people. The United States keeps a small port-based security contingent in Aden, but relies mostly on Yemeni authorities. At the same time, Washington is eager to strengthen relations with Yemen as another foothold in the Arab world. The U.S. ambassador, however, dismissed questions that security risks were overshadowed by political objectives when U.S. warships began refueling in Aden in June 1999. About 25 Navy vessels have used the port. ``We obviously ... determined it was safe to come into this port ... if we had specific and credible information to the contrary, the ship would not have come in,'' said Bodine. U.S. officials have placed a moratorium on naval stops in Aden for the moment. A final decision will be made once the $1 billion guided missile destroyer is towed away or taken aboard a special carrier vessel. The ship could leave Aden as early as this week.

The family of Seaman Recruit Cherone Gunn spent Sunday morning in church, grieving the loss of the 22-year-old who was among 17 killed in Thursday's attack on the USS Cole. At the same time, 33 of Gunn's injured comrades were being flown back to the Cole's home port to be reunited with their loved ones. The injuries to the 31 men and two women ranged from broken ribs and collapsed lungs to multiple fractures and burns, said Lt. Cmdr. Jim Mensching, an emergency medicine physician at Portsmouth Naval Hospital. He said all 33 would be hospitalized at least overnight. Relatives of the crew had been converging on the Norfolk Naval Station, the Atlantic Fleet headquarters, since Thursday when an explosion blew a 40-by-40 foot hole in the side of the destroyer during a refueling stop in Yemen's port of Aden. They were given regular briefings by Navy officials, plus assistance from chaplains and counselors, said Cmdr. Denny Moynihan, a Navy spokesman. ``It's an entire Cole family,'' Moynihan said. Fellow sailors and officers in dress whites lined up along the tarmac along with family members of the injured as the transport plane arrived early Sunday evening. Children waved small U.S. flags and flowers as the injured sailors began leaving the plane. Some of the injured were helped down the ramp to the arms of waiting family members. Some walked, others used canes and crutches. The most seriously injured were carried off the plane on stretchers. Relatives of six remaining injured crew members, still hospitalized in Germany, have flown to the U.S. military's Landstuhl Regional Medical Center to see them. The most seriously injured, a man in his 20s, was suffering from multiple fractures in his legs, ankles, feet and wrists, as well as abdominal injuries, doctors said. ``We hope he will recover from his wounds, but he has been extremely injured and anything can happen with this type of extensive injuries,'' said Thomas Burkhard, a senior Navy doctor at Landstuhl. Sunday morning, Gunn was remembered during a memorial service at the Basilica of Saint Mary of the Immaculate Conception in Norfolk, the same place where he was christened 22 years earlier. Gunn's parents, fiancee and three brothers were joined by members of the congregation, who provided hugs and offers of assistance. ``When you're in pain like that you think you need a shot of cognac, but what I really needed was a shot of the church,'' said Gunn's father, Louge Gunn. Since Gunn's mother, Mona, heard the news of her son's death on Thursday, friends from the church, colleagues and relatives had flooded the family's home with messages of support. ``There's been a steady flow of people in our house from 8 or 9 a.m. until the evening,'' Mona Gunn said. ``I went up (to bed) at about 9 p.m. yesterday and there must have been 30 or 40 people downstairs.'' Louge Gunn, a retired chief with the Navy, stressed the pride he felt for his son, who enlisted in the Navy in January. ``He was a hero,'' Louge Gunn said. ``He gave his life for his country, for something that he loved _ the Navy. He was a sailor, a true sailor. His life was fulfilled.'' ___ On the Net: Navy: http://www.navy.mil/

Yemen is a failed state on the mend just around the corner from Somalia, in a truly wild neighborhood. It has been a haven for international terrorists and radical Islamic groups and there is little evidence that the government has any control over them. Given these facts, some critics are already blaming policy-makers for placing U.S. forces in such a dangerous place _ and by extension, in all such places. Using a refueling stop to build stronger ties with a volatile and struggling Arab nation not only backfired, such critics say, it shouldn't have been tried. ``It's not worth the risk,'' said Richard N. Haass, director of foreign policy studies at the Brookings Institution who served on the National Security Council under President George Bush. ``Yemen has a bad record, and it's still a place where the government is unable or unwilling to take certain steps against certain terrorist groups. We must become more selective and more wary of who we do normal operations with.'' Others at least as numerous insist that the United States must not let terrorists dictate how and where it projects its presence on the globe. And to be sure, the United States is staying put in the Middle East. ``We have very large interests in the region that aren't just important, they are vital,'' said former Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Ind., who headed the House International Relations Committee. Hamilton's list of interests is a long one: unfettered access to affordable oil; protecting Israel's security; limiting the spread of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons and the missiles to launch them; checking the influence of Islamic fundamentalists; advancing economic development in the region. ``It would be an absolute victory for terrorists, if they're behind this attack, if we pulled back and stopped doing our job in the Middle East or elsewhere in the world, and we're not going to give them that victory,'' said the Pentagon spokesman, Kenneth H. Bacon. Indeed, say critics of withdrawal, wouldn't abandoning the field in places like Yemen just leave them open to getting worse? Everyone points to Somalia as the example to avoid. But it wasn't the worst case by any means. Consider, for example, the experts in the Reagan administration who put U.S. troops in a barracks at the airport in Lebanon in 1983. After the killing of 241 U.S. servicemen by a Shiite Muslim driving a suicide truck bomb in October 1983, U.S. resolve was badly shaken and there was a furious domestic debate over whether the United State should have brought in troops in the first place, or whether it should have done so in a different way. The alternative, which came to pass when the U.S. troops left, was Syrian control, for which everyone in the region is still paying the price. The thing that the Saudis, Egyptians and others in the region remember most about the marines in Beirut was not their arrival, but their departure. In Arab eyes, the marines simply cut and ran from Lebanon when the Syrians and their Lebanese allies made the cost of staying too high. Both sides of the leave-or-stay debate, however, ignore a simple point: that there are common-sense rules of engagement for doing business in dodgy places that could reduce the risks of operating in them. First of all, the diplomatic and military services should invest heavily in intelligence, preferably the kind using real eyes and ears, which can infiltrate terrorist groups and snitch. ``We're constantly reading the tea leaves very carefully,'' said one four-star officer with experience in the Middle East. ``You continually assess the intelligence, bounce those observations off others and gauge the host nation's level of security cooperation. These things don't stay on a flat line, they ebb and flow.'' Second, avoid stationing forces where they can become targets of opportunity and resentment. After the 1996 bombing of a housing complex in Saudi Arabia, in which 19 airmen were killed, U.S. troops in Dhahran were moved out of urban compounds into more defensible desert bases. Third, when traveling around the region, go well armed and avoid falling into predictable patterns that are vulnerable to preplanned attack. Fourth, to the extent possible, limit dependence on host-nation support for security, supplies and other services that would allow terrorists to carry out an inside job, as the bombing of the destroyer Cole seems to have been. Fifth, work closely with the host country's intelligence and police forces to limit vulnerabilities. These are pretty straightforward operating principles, but they may be ignored, either because of overconfidence in U.S. armed might (forgetting that the whole point of terrorism is to puncture that very image), or because U.S. forces overseas often want to be seen as benevolent and helpful. ``It's very, very complicated,'' said Adm. Stanley R. Arthur, who commanded allied naval forces in the 1991 Persian gulf war. ``The basic nature of Americans is that we're much more comfortable reaching out than being in a bunker mentality.'' In Lebanon, the United States trusted all factions to accept that it would be an even-handed guardian of order. In Yemen, it trusted the port authority not to be infiltrated by Islamic kamikazes, a doubtful proposition at best. ``They executed the plan as it was specified,'' Adm. Vern Clark, the chief of naval operations said of the U.S. commanders' security precautions. Today, it is clear that the plan was inadequate. What happened in Yemen is a reminder that the world abounds in dangerous places, that U.S. forces are vulnerable whenever they venture into them and that they must take precautions equal to that knowledge.

The Nobel prize in physics is usually bestowed for an abstract theoretical insight or esoteric experimental technique that deepens science's comprehension of the world. And physics being physics, it is often a challenge to explain to anyone but specialists just what the laureates are being honored for. Last year two Dutch physicists were recognized, in the Nobel committee's words, ``for elucidating the quantum structure of electroweak interactions.'' The year before two Americans and a German bagged the prize ``for their discovery of a new form of quantum fluid with fractionally charged excitations.'' In contrast, this year's award, announced last week in Stockholm, seemed surprisingly down to earth. The three winners will share the prize for the invention of microelectronic chips and other components that lie at the heart of laptop computers, CD players, cell phones, fiber-optic transmission lines and other wonders of the digital age. But the honor, especially when considered alongside the other big science prizes _ for medicine or physiology and for chemistry _ was striking in another way. There is no Nobel Prize for computer science. But obliquely and perhaps unconsciously, the judges were using the tools at their disposal to recognize how formidable the notion of information has become, pervading not just the technologies we devise but the way we think about ourselves. While the physics prize went to three architects of the computer revolution, the chemistry prize went to the inventors of a technique for making plastic conduct electricity _ a technology that might one day be used to design cheap, low-energy video displays that can be folded like sheets of stationery. And the physiology prize went to a trio of researchers who helped develop the modern view of the brain as a kind of computer, its neurons trading data as though they were biological chips. The timing of the awards, each worth about $913,000, was probably coincidental, but the message was hard to miss: The notion of information has become indispensable for both manipulating and understanding nature. Half the physics prize will go to Jack S. Kilby, a 76-year-old retired engineer for Texas Instruments, for his major role in inventing integrated circuits, in which millions of tiny transistors, trading streams of digital data, are now etched onto a single silicon computer chip. The other half of the money will be split by a Russian and an American physicist _ Dr. Zhores I. Alferov and Dr. Herbert Kroemer _ for devising tiny devices called semiconductor heterostructures, used in the high-speed processing of electronic and optical signals, blips of electricity and light. The research that won the chemistry prize, given to two Americans and a Japanese, Dr. Alan J. Heeger, Dr. Alan G. MacDiarmid and Dr. Hideki Shirakawa, opens up numerous possibilities for data processing, including not just flexible video screens but powerful chips in which single molecules process bits of information. All these inventions grew from the now commonplace realization that numbers, words, sounds and images _ anything that can be described precisely _ can be translated into a simple binary code of ones and zeroes and manipulated rapidly and almost flawlessly by machine. But new technologies are just the beginning of the information revolution. The most intellectually fruitful development has been the cross-fertilization between computer science and neuroscience. Thinking of computers anthropomorphically has become second nature: A programming code is a language; an array of silicon chips is a memory. The prize for medicine or physiology, given to Dr. Arvid Carlsson, Dr. Paul Greengard and Dr. Eric Kandel, is a reminder that the commerce in ideas flows both ways. The researchers, each in his own manner, have clarified how data circulate inside the brain. Molecules called neurotransmitters ferry signals from neuron to neuron, the information processors of the nervous system. There are obvious differences between electronic and biological circuitry. Computer chips communicate through simple metal wires. Neurons send their molecular data streams across complex junctions called synapses. And the language of the brain seems to be more complex than the simple binary chattering of computerese. But viewed at the most abstract level, both brains and computers operate the same way, by translating phenomena _ sounds, images and so forth _ into a code that can be stored and manipulated, giving both creature and their creations a firmer grip on the world. Kandel has drawn an especially vivid link between the nervous system and electronic circuitry. In classic experiments he showed how learning causes changes in the neurological wiring of a sea slug called Aplysia, whose nervous system is so simple that experimenting with it is like tinkering with an old radio. Training the creature to react vigorously to a stimulus, like an annoying squirt of water, causes an increase in the flow of neurotransmitters _ biochemical information _ across certain synapses, a tweaking of the neurological volume controls. The implication is that more complex brain functions are built from millions of these kinds of processes, what Kandel has called ``letters in the cellular alphabet of learning.'' Next to the brain, the most obvious biological information processor is the genetic machinery of the cell. The design of an organism is encoded into the chemical alphabet of DNA and manipulated to direct the assembly of proteins. Again the trade in ideas flows in both directions: scientists have recently made DNA computers that carry out simple computations inside test tubes. And in the physics labs, experimenters are playing with simple quantum computers in which individual atoms manipulate bits of data. True to form, some theorists argue that it's not only in captivity that matter behaves this way: All the quarks and electrons in the cosmic wilds are exchanging information each time they interact. Alfred Nobel's prizes, paid for by the fortune he made from dynamite, began in an age when matter and energy seemed to explain nearly everything. (The first physics prize, in 1901, went to Wilhelm Conrad Roentgen for discovering X-rays.) Last week's prizes finally commemorated science's move into a new era, the information age.

Divers searched water-filled compartments of the USS Cole on Monday and crews with powerful metal cutters tried to slice through the wreckage to reach more victims as sailors worked to stabilize their crippled warship. Conditions improved slightly for those aboard, with damaged electricity facilities restored to the point where the air conditioning could be turned on for the crew, said Lt. Terrence Dudley, spokesman for the U.S. 5th Fleet. Temperatures have been in the 90s in Aden, and the crew has been without air conditioning since the explosion Thursday that killed 17 sailors in a suspected act of terrorism. Other officials said exhausted Cole sailors were spending some time resting aboard two other Navy ships after working until dawn Sunday to keep the ship afloat when a bulkhead collapsed. Pressure variations had blasted open the bulkhead while sailors were draining areas of the ship, sending more water flooding in. Electrical shorts kept crews from using the regular pumps, so they jury-rigged a system using firefighting equipment. The crew was to receive a visit Monday from Gen. Tommy Franks, Tampa, Fla.-based commander of the U.S. Central Command. Franks was also scheduled to meet with Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh, officials said. There has been no credible claim of responsibility for the apparent suicide attack, which killed 17 sailors, wounded 39 others and punched a 40-by-40-foot hole in the hull. Yemeni security forces have detained more than a dozen people for questioning, but no arrests have been announced. It ranks as the deadliest terrorist attack on the U.S. military since the bombing of an Air Force barracks in Saudi Arabia in 1996 that killed 19. U.S. officials have suspended naval stops in Aden. The bodies of 10 victims remained missing. Crews were trying to reach the two visible and the 10 missing, perhaps trapped behind floors and walls bent wildly by the blast. In Virginia, doctors said some the injured would soon be released to go home. On Sunday, 33 of the injured were flown from a U.S. military hospital in Germany where they received initial care to the Cole's home port, Virginia's Norfolk Naval Station. Six injured sailors remained hospitalized in Germany. Four will likely return to the United States on Tuesday or Wednesday, while the two others will stay for at least another week, Col. James Rundell, deputy director of the Landstuhl Regional Medical Center in western Germany, said Monday. Meanwhile, terrorism and explosive experts combed through scenes described by a U.S. official as ``utter devastation.'' On the deck, ``confetti size'' pieces from the wooden attack boat were collected, the official said. Among the tasks for the investigators: looking for residue that could indicate the type of explosives. One of the officials said the power of the blast suggested ``more than just TNT'' _ which could suggest a well-organized and supplied group. The officials said the blast occurred shortly after the ship was secured to two buoys to begin refueling in the harbor, which was full of pleasure boats, fishing vessels and merchant ships. Two people on the attack boat reportedly stood at attention briefly before the explosion. The blast at the waterline was close to the dining area for senior enlisted officers. Most hands were busy finishing the docking. A few minutes later, however, and the mess area would have started to fill. Immediately after the explosion, the ship began to fill with oily water from the 40-foot deep harbor. The impact wrenched open hatches and buckled parts of the deck on the 4-year-old destroyer, whose modern construction may have helped it say afloat. Power was lost and generators were used to pump out water and keep the Cole afloat. The Cole will have to be moved from Aden for major repairs. A U.S. defense official said Monday the trip could begin in as soon as a few days, and would be made on the back of a vessel known as a heavy lift ship, like a floating dry dock capable of carrying ships of up to 30,000 tons. The unloaded Cole is 8,300 tons. U.S. diplomats have insisted the Yemeni government is not suspected of any terrorists links. But security has been a key issue regarding Aden, the home base for an Islamic militant group founded by the brother of Afghan-based terrorist mastermind Osama bin Laden _ accused of links to the 1998 bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania that killed 224 people. Afghanistan's Taliban rulers denied bin Laden was involved, according to a Taliban statement published Monday in Pakistan's Urdu-language newspaper Jang. The Taliban said ``Osama cannot carry out such activities from Afghan territory.'' Bin Laden has been living in Afghanistan since 1996 when he fled Sudan. The Taliban have refused to hand him over to the United States. Bin Laden has criticized Yemen for allowing U.S. ships to refuel at Aden. The United States keeps a small port-based security contingent in Aden, but relies mostly on Yemeni authorities. Washington is eager to strengthen relations with Yemen as another foothold in the Arab world. U.S. officials dismissed questions that security risks were overshadowed by political objectives when warships began refueling in Aden in June 1999. About 25 Navy vessels have used the port.

Yugoslavia's crown prince has launched an ambitious tour of the land of his ancestors, returning home now that the communist era is over and President Slobodan Milosevic has been ousted. Crown Prince Aleksandar Karadjordjevic arrived in Belgrade on Sunday a beaming, optimistic royal, shaking hands with well-wishers and politicians. ``I came to a new, liberated Serbia,'' said the heir to the defunct throne who has lived in exile because his father, King Peter II, the last ruling monarch, fled the country in 1941. Serbia is the larger of Yugoslavia's two remaining republics and the ancestral land of the Karadjordjevic dynasty. Still, the crown prince remained evasive about what role, if any, he would like to play in a post-Milosevic Yugoslavia. Asked Sunday if he will try to reclaim the throne, Karadjordjevic said only: ``What I suggest is that we go on with democracy.'' In the past, he has said the royal family should return to Yugoslavia without specifying if members of the dynasty were planning to reclaim the throne. So far, however, he has made no statement as to what role he would like to play in the country. On Monday, the prince planned to head into central Serbia to tour major cities. This visit was the most extensive planned by Karadjordjevic to date. Some 250 people came to the airport Sunday to greet him, chanting: ``Long live the King,'' and ``Stay with us.'' The prince, who resides in London, warned that Milosevic, who now lives under virtual house arrest after recent street riots swept him from power, may not be totally defeated. ``Reactionary forces are still giving resistance, but not for long,'' Karadjordjevic said. Founded originally as a monarchy, Yugoslavia became a communist-run federation after World War II. Members of the dynasty were banned from returning and their property was confiscated. Karadjordjevic was first allowed to return in 1992, but only briefly, and he soon began to openly criticize Milosevic for destructive policies. When the 18 opposition parties joined forces earlier this year to oust Milosevic, Karadjordjevic openly endorsed them and their presidential candidate, Vojislav Kostunica. With their win, he again praised them for ``leading the country to true democracy.'' Kostunica became president Oct. 7, after massive riots against Milosevic who tried to rig results of the Sept. 24 elections to stay in power. On Sunday Karadjordjevic met with Kostunica and also with the head of Serb Orthodox Church, Patriarch Pavle. ``Today, the important thing to do is to bring aid to the people and that the EU nations as well as the United States keep their word and help,'' he said. There have been no reliable opinion polls recently on whether the monarchy should be restored. But polls in the mid-1990s showed a solid one-third support for the idea and more than two-thirds overall saying they wouldn't object if it would bring stability. ``I lived for this day. Thank God that he is here again,'' said florist Leposava Mihajlovic, 62, among those who turned up to greet the prince. ``There should be a plebiscite so people can decide'' on possible restoration, she said. Kostunica has suggested the issue could be decided by the people but has placed priority on economic recovery after decades of communist rule followed by the Milosevic years, which led to widespread poverty. In neighboring Bulgaria and Romania, monarchies were also abolished after World War II, but have not been restored despite the collapse of communism.

and in that same part of the world, on the attack on the american destroyer "uss cole", still no claims of responsible tonight. no hard evidence pointing to one terrorist group or one country. as jim miklaszewski reports now from the pentagon with 12 sailors still missing, the agony of the "cole" goes on. jim? tom the u.s. is stepping up efforts to find the attackers. the pentagon calls it operation determined response. the "uss cole," severely damaged, but stable today, the crew exhausted after battling to save the ship from flooding. the crew is focused, disciplined and well-trained. and more help is on the way. three amphibious ships with 2,000 heavily armed u.s. marines steaming toward "the cole" to provide additional security and support. meanwhile, new details emerging about that terrorist sneak attack. investigators report two suicide bombers pull alongside "the cole" in a 21-foot fiberglass boat that disintegrates into thousands of confetti-like pieces in the blast. with the force of one ton of tnt, the explosion tears through the half-inch steel hull, so powerful, it pushes the entire mess deck upward, almost flush with the deck above it, crushing everything in between. that's where two of the dead and the ten missing remain trapped, making recovery difficult. we have a very good idea of where they are. at the same time, the president of yemen pledges full cooperation in tracking down those responsible for the attack. yemen police detain and question more than 150 people connected to harbor operations, but no firm leads. fbi and counterterrorism officials are focusing instead on osama bin laden, seen here in a video released only three weeks ago, threatening action against united states troops in the middle east, including yemen. now, that should have sounded alarm bells here at the pentagon because the u.s. has no regular troops in yemen. the only ones even scheduled to visit were aboard the "uss cole". tom? thanks very much. jim miklaszewski tonight. as the survivors of the blast in yemen begin to make their way home, we are getting a first-hand and frightening look at those terrifying moments on board the ship. 19-year-old andrew nemeth, a fireman's apprentice, has been in the navy for almost a year and a half. tonight, andrew nemeth "in his own words." a couple minutes before the blast, i just walked out of my engine room -- i just got done cleaning up, and i walked out and went and got in the chow line, started talking with a couple of my buddies like normal. i went to grab my tray and get my food, and then the blast happened. i didn't hear really anything. i remember being up in the air and falling to the ground and having fuel sprayed all over me. that's why i, initially, thought one of the fuel lines busted. first instinct was to look around for any of my friends i could find, which i didn't see any because it was real smokey. we lost some people. they were my shipmates. they were pretty much like brothers and sisters to me. the term shipmate means more than it ever will again. andrew nemeth, one of the sailors who survived the blast on the "uss cole," "in his own words."

This is The World, a co-production of the BBC World Service, PRI, and WGBH in Boston. I am Lisa Mullins. In Yemen today security forces interrogated people who service US warships in the port of Aden. The authorities were investigating the case of last week's bombing of the USS Cole, which killed 17 American sailors. Yemen said today that it considers the blast a premeditated criminal act. That's an important reversal from the government's earlier position. It clears the way for US terrorism experts to work closely with Yemeni authorities. Mohammed al-Qadhi, the editor of the Yemen Observer in the capital Sana, says Yemeni investigators have already come up with evidence but have not yet disclosed it. This evidence has not been revealed yet because of the process of investigation, because they want to reach the criminals. One of the things they are saying they have as evidence are video pictures of the port. What sort of pictures are they talking about and have those pictures been passed on to American investigators? The photos talked about were camera, which is belonging to the Aden Free Zone port and they said that it had taken photos for the whole incident while it was happening. So they actually have an image of the bombs going off at the time? They haven't said what are they exactly because as I told you, they do not want these criminals who committed this incident to know what has been revealed yet. They are continuing the investigation and are following up the criminals in cooperation with the American side. In terms of that follow up it's been said that the government has made several arrests already. Do we know if they are connected to the bombing and do we know who was arrested? They arrested some suspected people and some people who were around the place of incident to find out some more information. Is the information, whatever they are gathering, being shared with US investigators? In other words do we know what kind of cooperation the US is getting from Yemeni authorities? They are having full cooperation with the American side, technical things and investigations themselves, and what is reached by both sides they inform each other to know how to follow up the incident. Do you know what it is that the United States is asking for from the Yemeni government in terms of cooperation in the investigation? I think this was clarified by President Salah and he said that they will cooperate with the Americans in all aspects, and today President Salah has met with the Commander of the American Navy and submitted evidence to him and they discussed cooperation in military side and the bilateral relations. I wonder if you can speak as the editor of this newspaper, I am not sure if you have the kind of tradition that American newspapers do and that's the 'Letter to the Editor' segment where you have some of your readers who write in. But I am curious to find out what people are saying about this incident and the kind of cooperation that the United States is looking for. What are you hearing from your readers? This incident should be committed by a foreign country and it's aimed to destroy the Yemeni-American relations, which until now is very good. Yemeni people do respect all western countries and they do not have anything to do against these countries. Yemenis want to develop their relations because we are a developing country and this is what all Yemenis are talking about. Mohammed al-Qadhi is the editor of the Yemen Observer in the capital of Yemen, Sana. Thank you very much. We appreciate it. Thank you very much.

Missouri Gov. Mel Carnahan was killed in a plane crash Monday night, along with one of his sons and a campaign adviser, according to relatives of the adviser. Carnahan, Roger Carnahan and the governor's campaign adviser, Chris Sifford, all died in the crash, said Frank Sifford a nephew of Chris Sifford's father. Earlier, Jefferson County Sheriff's Department said the plane had crashed in a hilly wooded area south of St. Louis. Missouri Highway Patrol Sgt. Tim McDonald said debris from the crash was scattered, making identification of the plane difficult. He said the governor's security staff was at the crash site because they had not heard from Carnahan and ``tensions were high.'' The governor had been expected at a campaign rally at 8 p.m. in New Madrid, about 150 miles south of St. Louis. McDonald said the governor's security staff was at the crash site because they had not heard from Carnahan and ``tensions were high.'' The governor had been expected at a campaign rally at 8 p.m. in New Madrid, about 150 miles south of St. Louis. Carnahan, 66, a popular Democratic governor finishing his second term, was running for the U.S. Senate seat held by Republican John Ashcroft. Their race has been one of the closest and most bitterly contested in the nation this year. Jerry Nachtigal, the governor's spokesman in Jefferson City, told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch that Carnahan, one of his sons and a staff member were scheduled to be on board the plane. He did not confirm the governor's plane was the one that crashed. At 11 p.m., the governor's office called Lt. Gov. Roger Wilson and the state treasurer to return to the Statehouse in Jefferson City immediately for an emergency, the newspaper reported. Both Carnahan and his son Randy were licensed pilots. Randy Carnahan normally flew the campaign plane on political events. Police said Lambert Airport in St. Louis was tracking the plane, which took off about 7 p.m. from a small airport across the Mississippi River in Illinois. The plane disappeared from the radar screen at 7:33 p.m. Officials said the plane went down about 25 miles from St. Louis. The area is thick with trees, scattered farm houses and fields and there was a light rain and heavy fog. ``We found wreckage in very small pieces spread over a large area. We have found some remains we cannot identify at this point,'' said Capt. Ed Kemp of the Jefferson County Sheriff's Department. He said it was unclear if the remains were those of one or more people. Tom Hunter, who lives near the crash site, told St. Louis television station KMOV he heard the plane flying over. ``I thought, 'What a crazy person in this kind of weather.' Next thing, sounded like it was in a very steep dive, the engine was just screaming,'' Hunter said. He said he heard a loud explosion and the sky turned red. ``That was it,'' Hunter said. ``It was total silence. I told my wife to call 911.'' Vice President Al Gore, in St. Louis for Tuesday's third and final presidential debate, telephoned Carnahan's wife, Jean, after the news broke, Gore aides said. Carnahan won his first public election at age 26 as a municipal judge in his hometown of Rolla. He was elected to the Missouri House of Representatives two years later and served two terms, and later served as state treasurer. In 1988, Carnahan was elected lieutenant governor. In 1992, he won the governor's office in a landslide. He won a second term in 1996. The lieutenant governor would serve out the remainder of the governor's term. The candidates for governor on the November ballot are Democratic State Treasurer Bob Holden and Republican Rep. Jim Talent. In 1976, another Senate challenger in Missouri, state Rep. Jerry Litton, died in a plane crash as he and his family were flying to a victory celebration the night he won the Democratic nomination. ___ On the Net: Carnahan's site: http://www.gov.state.mo.us/bio.htm

As Republican George W. Bush and Democrat Al Gore prepared to perch on stools and take voters' questions in a crucial third debate, the sudden death of Missouri Gov. Mel Carnahan cast a pall over their final meeting. After talk of cancellation or a postponement for mourning, plans were made early Tuesday to continue the 9 p.m. EDT event on schedule, officials of both campaigns said. ``In the end, there was general agreement that Mel Carnahan would have wanted us to go forward,'' a senior Bush campaign official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. Bush's wife, Laura, canceled plans for a morning rally. Bush campaign officials also decided to tone down a post-debate rally, and were even considering canceling it. Gore hadn't planned any events before the debate. Carnahan, a Democrat who was running for the Senate, campaigned with Gore whenever the vice president was in Missouri and would have accompanied Gore aboard Air Force II to a Kansas City rally on Wednesday. Gore called Mrs. Carnahan with his condolences after the news broke Monday night, aides said. ``We're all waking up, honestly, to the tragedy and the pain of it and the shock of it,'' Democratic vice presidential candidate Joseph Lieberman said Tuesday morning on CNN. The Bush and Gore campaigns did not talk to each other directly about the possibility of postponement, but went through the debate commission's director, Janet Brown, in a series of pre-dawn phone calls. Eventually, Brown recommended that the debate should go on, and neither side objected, according to campaign officials. The commission was to announce the plans later Tuesday, with each candidate given time at the debate's start to say a few words about Carnahan, who died Monday night in the crash of a small plane. With the larger bloc of uncommitted voters across the nation apparently holding the key to the election, both candidates were clearly mindful of the high stakes if the encounter goes forward as planned. The informal question-and-answer format is one Gore is comfortable with, and he promised on Monday to ``just have an open meeting,'' as he had done many times before. Bush, who has less formal debate experience than the vice president but whose standing in public opinion polls rose after the first two face-offs, vowed to ``just tell it like it is.'' The debate, just three weeks before the Nov. 7 election, will be held on the campus of Washington University. While the moderator will be the same as in the Boston and Winston-Salem, N.C., debates _ Jim Lehrer of PBS _ questions this time will come from the audience. The Gallup polling organization, assigned by the Commission on Presidential Debates to recruit questioners, started with a random sample of all registered voters in St. Louis and its suburbs, and then screened out all but ``uncommitted voters,'' said Frank Newport, Gallup's executive editor. The result was a group of area voters who say they could support either Gore or Bush _ though they might be leaning one way or the other. The theater-in-the-round stage will be informally set with two stools and surrounded by 100 questioners and an additional 500 onlookers. Tuesday night's debate marks the beginning of the final stretch. And, with polls continuing to show the race to be neck-and-neck, any stumble could have major impact on a contest in which both candidates are fiercely wooing a dwindling band of undecided voters. Gore held a mock debate on Monday, inviting 23 voters to the Innsbrook resort outside St. Louis to help him practice. ``I'm going to do what I've done a lot of times in Tennessee, and that is, just have an open meeting,'' Gore said. In 16 years in Congress, Gore held some 1,000 town meetings with Tennessee constituents, and they've become a regular feature of his presidential campaign. After an uncharacteristically muted demeanor in last week's debate, Gore, was looking to do better this time. ``I don't think you play it safe,'' said Gore's campaign chairman, William Daley, previewing the Tuesday night encounter. ``I think you try to be very natural and lay out in a forward way the compelling reasons for the election to go your way.'' Bush had long resisted the town-hall-style session, but in recent weeks on the campaign trail has been doing them almost daily. ``I've felt comfortable about it,'' the Republican said Monday.

Gov. Mel Carnahan, the Democratic candidate in one of the most hotly contested U.S. Senate races in the country, was killed when the plane shuttling him to a campaign rally crashed in rainy, foggy weather. The Cessna 335 also carrying Carnahan's son Roger and campaign adviser Chris Sifford, 37, went down Monday night 25 miles south of St. Louis. They had been en route to a rally for Carnahan, 66, who was running against Republican Sen. John Ashcroft. There were no survivors, said Jerry Nachtigal, the governor's spokesman. Five investigators from the National Transportation Safety Board were expected to arrive Tuesday in St. Louis. ``We found wreckage in very small pieces spread over a large area. We have found some remains we cannot identify at this point,'' Jefferson County Sheriff's Capt. Ed Kemp said. Ashcroft's campaign immediately suspended all advertising ``out of respect for Governor Carnahan and his family,'' Ashcroft campaign manager David Ayres said. The race had been a dead heat for months. A Zogby poll taken for the St. Louis Post-Dispatch the first week of September gave Ashcroft 45 percent and Carnahan 43 percent, within the 4-point margin of error. Carnahan's name will stay on the Nov. 7 ballot because the deadline for changing it was Oct. 13, Secretary of State Bekki Cook said. Lt. Gov. Roger Wilson will serve out the remainder of Carnahan's term, until Jan. 8. Under the state Constitution, his title is acting governor. If more voters cast ballots for Carnahan than Ashcroft on Nov. 7, the seat would become vacant when Ashcroft's current term ends Jan. 3, Cook said. Wilson, a Democrat, would have constitutional authority to appoint a senator to fill the vacancy through the November 2002 general election, when the seat would be up for election, Cook said. The deaths prompted discussion of whether Tuesday night's presidential debate in St. Louis should be postponed. Tuesday morning, though, a Republican souce speaking on condition of anonymity said the debate would go forward. The NTSB said the twin-engine plane, a six-seater, was registered to a law firm where Roger Carnahan, 44, was a partner. The younger Carnahan was piloting the plane. The governor had been expected at the rally at 8 p.m. in New Madrid, about 125 miles south of the crash site, which was thick with trees, scattered farm houses and fields. State Sen. Jerry Howard, who was at the rally, said Roy Temple, executive director of the Missouri Democratic Party, got a page around 8 p.m. from Sifford. Sifford told Temple the governor's plane had encountered lightning and was going to return to St. Louis or Jefferson City, Howard said. Tom Hunter, who lives near the crash site, said he heard the plane flying overhead. ``I thought, 'What a crazy person in this kind of weather.' Next thing, sounded like it was in a very steep dive, the engine was just screaming,'' Hunter told St. Louis TV station KMOV. He said he heard a loud explosion and the sky turned red. ``That was it,'' Hunter said. ``It was total silence. I told my wife to call 911.'' In Jefferson City at dawn Tuesday, Susie Shultz, a state employee, brought red mums to the governor's mansion. ``I thought he was wonderful,'' she said. ``He did so much for our state. Mel Carnahan was the education man. He was for the right things.'' Carnahan won his first public election at age 26 as a municipal judge in his hometown of Rolla. He was elected to the Missouri House of Representatives two years later and served two terms before becoming state treasurer. In 1988, Carnahan was elected lieutenant governor. Four years later, he won the governor's office in a landslide and was re-elected in 1996. He was barred by state law from seeking a third consecutive term as governor. ``Governor Carnahan always believed public service was a noble calling,'' Nachtigal said. ``We will miss him dearly.'' President Clinton called Carnahan's wife, Jean, to express condolences while he was at the Mideast summit in Egypt. The couple had four children. ``He's known him for a long time. They've worked together on a lot of issues,'' Clinton spokesman Jake Siewert said. In 1976, another Senate challenger in Missouri, U.S. Rep. Jerry Litton, died in a plane crash as he and his family were flying to a victory celebration the night he won the Democratic nomination. The last governor to die in office was Florida Gov. Lawton Chiles on Dec. 12, 1998. The 68-year-old collapsed while exercising in the governor's mansion gymnasium. South Dakota Gov. George Mickelson died in 1993 when the state's airplane slammed into a silo in eastern Iowa. ___ On the Net: Missouri State Government: http://www.gov.state.mo.us National Governors' Association: http://www.nga.org/subtocnga.htm John Ashcroft: www.johnashcroft.com Mel Carnahan: www.carnahan2000.com

Yemeni investigators found bomb-making equipment in a house near the port of Aden and believe two men who spent several days there are linked to the bombing of the USS Cole, security officials said Tuesday. The officials identified the men, who have disappeared, only as non-Yemeni Arabs. Other Yemeni officials said they were Saudi. The disclosure comes a day after Yemen reversed its earlier position and called the blast that killed 17 Americans ``a premeditated criminal act.'' The new stance gave a crucial boost to the investigation. The country's security forces interrogated dozens of port workers and others on Monday, including the head of the company that services U.S. warships. The security officials said the house was searched Monday and bomb-making materials were found. The officials did not elaborate on what the materials were. The officials said the men were believed to have entered Yemen four days before Thursday's bombing. They did not say which country the men had traveled from. There has been no credible claim of responsibility for the deadliest terrorist attack on the U.S. military since the 1996 bombing of an Air Force barracks in Saudi Arabia that killed 19. But immediate suspicion fell on terrorist mastermind Osama bin Laden _ accused in the 1998 bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania that killed 224 people. That August, the United States fired dozens of Tomahawk cruise missiles on eastern Afghanistan in an attempt to kill bin Laden. In his first statement since December 1998, bin Laden warned against another attack. He said Tuesday that an attack would not kill him and vowed to continue his battle against the ``enemies of Islam.'' He made no direct reference to the Yemen attack, but Afghanistan's Taliban rulers on Monday denied bin Laden was involved. U.S. officials believe the attackers brought an explosives-laden small boat near the Cole and detonated it in a suicide attack. Two men were seen standing up in the small boat before the explosion, official have said. Many Yemenis have said they do not believe the attack was the result of a homegrown plot, and Tuesday's disclosures put the spotlight on neighboring Saudi Arabia. Decades of border disputes have marred relations between Yemen and Saudi Arabia. The two countries signed an agreement in June to settle the disputes. Yemen has long contested Saudi Arabia's claim to three Red Sea islands and parts of the Empty Quarter, a vast desert region with potentially lucrative oil deposits. Meanwhile, four of the U.S. sailors seriously injured in the apparent suicide bombing of the Cole were flown home Tuesday from Germany, leaving behind two critically ill shipmates. The three men and a woman arrived on an army bus and were carried on stretchers onto a C-141 transport plane bound for a Norfolk, Va., naval base. One gave a thumbs-up to watching reporters. The sailors had been treated at the U.S. military's Landstuhl Regional Medical Center in western Germany since their arrival Saturday. Thirty-three other injured sailors returned to the United States over the weekend, and 13 were released from a Virginia hospital by Monday afternoon.

an investigation is under way to determine the cause of the plane crash that killed missouri governor mel carnahan, his son roger and a campaign aide. carnahan was en route to new madrid when the cessna 335 went down last night 25 miles south of st. louis. the weather at the time was rainy and foggy, with zero visibility. witnesses told investigators the plane sounded like it was in a dive, then an explosion could be heard and the sky lit up. the popular democrat had served as governor since 1993 and was locked in a close race for the u.s. senate with republican john ashcroft. president clinton telephoned carnahan's wife, jean, today to express his condolences. carnahan was 66, his son roger, 44. campaign adviser chris sifford was 37. mourners are leaving behind notes, candles and flowers at the gate of the governor's mansion in jefferson city. one note honored carnahan as "a governor that believed in state employees." missouri's secretary of state says carnahan's name will remain on the ballot for the u.s. senate because it is too late to change it. in washington, senate minority leader tom daschle paid tribute. mel carnahan was a man of plain speech and enormous political courage. i believe he would have been a great united states senator, just as he was a great governor. his death is a loss to the people of missouri and to all americans. under missouri's constitution, lieutenant governor roger wilson becomes acting governor.

we'll begin with the "uss cole." there has been the first break in the case. morton dean reports in yemen. the investigation into the attack which crippled the ship took a positive turn when yemenis investigators discovered bombmaking equipment in a house said to be close to the port where the ship is anchored. the two men who briefly lived in the house are reportedly missing. yemenis authorities say the men, not believed to be yemenis, are linked to the attack. eyewitnesses say the attack was caused by two men on a suicide mission. u.s. sources confirm key details of the report tonight, but ambassador barbara bodine would only say the investigation is progressing. throughout this investigation we're going to be making significant progress day to day and certainly from yesterday to today, it has been a quantum leap. how destructive the bomb was became even more painfully apparent today. six more bodies have been recovered. they had been trapped in a tangled mass of steel above and below the water line. six sailors are still missing. the horror and the heroics on the "uss cole," when the massive bomb ripped through the ship, were relived this evening by one of the crew, lieutenant ann chamberlain. i just felt a large -- not so much a bang, but it seemed, to me, from where i was, it seemed like something had rammed the ship. now that vestigators have had their first major break, the confidence level here has risen, but u.s. officials still warn a long investigation lies ahead. morton dean, abc news, yemen. we will have live coverage of tomorrow's memorial service for the sailors who died on the "uss cole," eastern time.

good evening. as presidential candidates george w. bush and al gore prepare to meet in their final debate, a town hall format at washington university in st. louis, they'll be appearing in a state shocked by the loss of its governor in an overnight plane crash. and no doubt they'll be asked about today's developments in the middle east, including the biggest break yet in the terrorist attack on the "uss cole." more bodies were recovered from the wrecked area of the ship today. we begin with the "uss cole" story tonight, nbc's jim miklaszewski at the pentagon. jim? u.s. officials report significant process tonight in the "cole" destination, even as they continue to recover the dead. the bodies of six sailors, killed in the terrorist blast, are recovered from the "cole" today. the grim search continues for six more victims, still trapped in the twisted hull. back on shore, the investigation is building steam. yemen authorities discover bombmaking materials in an apartment in this neighborhood near the port, the apparent safe house for the suicide bombers. they also recover a car and boat trailer at dockside and find a witness, a 12-year-old boy, who says he watched the terrorists launch the boat loaded with explosives. two suspects are detained and questioned in aden. evidence from the "cole" are already back at fbi headquarters tonight for analysis. nothing conclusive yet, but encouraging to u.s. ambassador, barbara bodine. certainly from yesterday to today, it has been a quantum leap. terrorist usama bin laden is a prime suspect in the "cole" bombing. today he warns the u.s. not to launch retaliatory strikes against him. two years ago, the u.s. launched air strikes against bin laden targets in sudan and afghanistan, after he was linked to the bombings of two u.s. embassies in africa. meanwhile, more injured sailors arrived back home in norfolk tonight. a memorial service for their ship mates killed on the "cole" set for tomorrow. washington officials want to extradite any suspects arrested in yemen to stand trial here in the u.s. and while the pentagon says it's still way too early to talk about military retaliation, one official says, "we've got our finger on the trigger." tom? thank you very much, nbc's jim miklaszewski.

nbc news "in depth" tonight -- presidential politics, the third and final debate between vice president al gore and governor george w. bush at washington university in st. louis -- an event with very high stakes and with both candidates rattled by the sudden death of missouri's governor. nbc's claire shipman and david gregory are in st. louis. let's begin with claire shipman with the gore campaign -- what can we expect tonight? well, tom, gore has done very little in the way of formal preparations today in keeping with his desire to focus on relaxing more than studying. his campaign was hit hard by governor carnahan's death. gore has campaigned with carnahan and he made an unscheduled stop by carnahan campaign headquarters to offer condolences. we've been told there will be a moment of silence at the start of the debate and that gore will probably say something about the governor. despite the tragedy, don't look for gore to be overly somber tonight. aides say they are looking for and counting on an energetic performance. gore has participated in more than 1,000 town hall meetings. none more important than tonight. he knows he has to connect. and his record running state of texas. tom? let's go to david gregory who's covering the bush campaign. what can we expect on that side of the aisle? as you can expect, governor bush's mood has darkened as well. he said today along with the democrats, he and the campaign will put all campaign ads in the state of missouri out of respect. and he will skip a post debate rally that was scheduled tonight and he echoed the view of some of his advisers who wonder whether the mood will soften what might have otherwise been a hard-edged debate tonight. but bush's advisers are confident they say the pressure's on gore to perform. bush, they say, has to keep up what he's doing in the past two debates, keep up that strong showing and he will do well. one word about format -- not bush's favorite. he's not used to unscripted questions during town hall meetings and sometimes can be flustered by them the off-the-cuff questions that come up. tom? thank you very much, david gregory.

Investigators found bomb-making equipment in an apartment near the port of Aden and believe two former occupants may have carried out the suicide bombing that killed 17 sailors aboard the USS Cole, security officials said Tuesday. U.S. authorities would not comment directly on the disclosure. But the ambassador, Barbara Bodine, described the investigation as advancing ``a quantum leap.'' ``We are very hopeful we are going to get to the bottom of this,'' she said. Yemeni officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, identified the missing men only as non-Yemeni Arabs. Other Yemeni officials said they were from neighboring Saudi Arabia. Moments before the huge blast Thursday, two men were seen standing on the deck of a small vessel alongside the destroyer, U.S. authorities said. A 40-by-40-foot hole was blown into the Cole's hull and the attack ship disintegrated into ``confetti size'' pieces. On Tuesday, divers and other crew members using metal-slicing torches and crowbars pulled six more bodies from the tangled bowels of the Cole. Officials initially said seven bodies were recovered Tuesday, but later corrected the figure. Six victims remain trapped near the blast site. In Virginia, four of the more seriously wounded Cole sailors arrived at Norfolk Naval Station after a flight from Germany. Most of the 39 injured sailors had arrived in Virginia over the weekend, while two critically injured shipmates remain at the military's Landstuhl Regional Medical Center in western Germany. Speaking about the two suspects, the Yemeni officials said the apartment was searched Monday, when Yemen reversed an earlier position and called the blast ``a premeditated criminal act.'' A senior Saudi intelligence official visited Aden on Monday, but no details of the meeting were made public. The Yemeni officials would give no further information on the material found, but said the missing men arrived in Yemen four days before Thursday's attack. Bodine declined to comment on details of the case or speculate on possible links to larger terrorist groups, including that of Afghan-based Saudi dissident Osama bin Laden. She stressed that the investigation would continue. ``We want this investigation to go further ... to see how far back we can walk this. And those kinds of investigations can sometimes take some time,'' she said. The Yemeni find could be a key break on the first day of work for a joint FBI-Yemeni task force. The hunt, however, is already well under way. So far, Yemeni security forces have interrogated hundreds of port workers and others, including the head of the company that services U.S. warships. Some fragments from the blast were shipped to the United States for analysis by the first FBI agents to arrive after the attack. That initial evidence arrived on U.S. shores Monday night. There has been no credible claim of responsibility for the deadliest terrorist attack on the U.S. military since the 1996 bombing of an Air Force barracks in Saudi Arabia that killed 19. Immediate suspicion fell on bin Laden, accused in the 1998 bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania that killed 224 people. In retaliation, the United States fired dozens of Tomahawk cruise missiles at his suspected stronghold in eastern Afghanistan. In his first statement since December 1998, bin Laden said Tuesday that another such attack would not kill him or deter his battle against the ``enemies of Islam.'' He made no direct reference to the Aden attack. Afghanistan's Taliban rulers on Monday denied bin Laden was involved, but also said Tuesday that he could not have issued a statement because all means of communications have been denied him. FBI Director Louis Freeh transferred the investigation from Washington to the command of John O'Neill in the New York field office, which handled the East African embassy bombing cases. But U.S. officials denied this meant they could link the blast to bin Laden at this point. The full FBI team is expected to swell to 100 agents. Seventy are already in Aden, and 30 others are waiting in Germany for accommodations to be arranged. Many Yemenis have said they do not believe the attack was the result of a homegrown plot, and Tuesday's disclosures put the spotlight on Saudi Arabia. Bin Laden is a Saudi national of Yemeni heritage. Border disputes have marred relations between Yemen and Saudi Arabia, but an agreement was signed in June to seek a solution. Yemen has long contested the Saudi claim to three Red Sea islands and parts of the Empty Quarter, a vast desert region with potentially lucrative oil deposits. Aboard the stricken Cole, wreckage specialists fought their way through collapsed bulkheads and a maze of twisted metal to reach bodies. Above the oily harbor water, blowtorches cut slowly through the reinforced steel. Beneath them, in the cavern created by the blast, divers poked slowly through murky passages and fissures. The divers _ some of whom plucked victims from the doomed TWA 800 flight near Long Island in 1996 _ carried tools to try to pry apart the metal trapping the bodies. The bodies recovered Tuesday were found above and below the water line, said Rear Adm. Mark Fitzgerald, who is leading naval operations in the area. The cause of death: ``trauma from the blast,'' he said. Five bodies were recovered last week and were flown back to the United States. A memorial service for victims of the bombing is scheduled Wednesday at Norfolk Naval Station, the Cole's home port in Virginia. President Clinton and Defense Secretary William Cohen plan to attend. Security worries in Aden have mounted as more American investigators arrive in a nation the State Department described as a ``haven'' for terrorists. Efforts are made to keep most personnel either on other U.S. warships just offshore or in a hotel guarded by Yemeni soldiers and U.S. Marines. U.S. Navy officials say it could be weeks before the Cole can be raised onto a heavy lift ship and transported back to the United States for repairs. Nearly a week after the blast, one Cole sailor said she still has difficulty absorbing the aftermath. ``The first time I got a chance to sleep for an hour or so ... I woke up and I forgot,'' said Lt. Ann Chamberlain, of Washington, D.C.. ``It's weird.''

As rescue workers and federal officials searched a remote wooded area Tuesday for wreckage of a twin-engine plane that carried Gov. Mel Carnahan, his son and a campaign adviser, an investigator said the pilot had reported an instrument problem moments before the plane crashed on Monday night. The governor's son, Roger Carnahan, 44, who was flying the plane, reported experiencing trouble with the ``gyro,'' said an official close to the investigation who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Pilots rely on several gyroscopes and gyrocompasses to read a plane's direction and orientation, and it was unclear which gyro the pilot was referring to, the official said. The instruments become even more important in rain and clouds, the conditions on Monday night. Under those conditions, pilots can become disoriented and think a gyroscope's warning of danger is inaccurate. It could take months, though, for the cause of the crash to become clearer. But Robert Bartlett, manager of St. Louis Downtown Parks Airport, in Cahokia, Ill., where the plane took off at 7 p.m., said, ``There was no unusually unsafe weather or even unusual weather'' for flying on Monday night. In fact, he said that several planes arrived and departed within 10 minutes of the governor's plane taking off. ``They had no problems,'' Bartlett said, referring to other planes. ``We had arrivals and departures until we closed at 9 p.m.'' The National Weather Service in St. Louis said that visibility at the time of the crash was 3 miles and that the area was having ``moderate to heavy rain,'' although apparently there was no lightning. Many mourners and well-wishers gathered outside the Governor's Mansion in Jefferson City, where they placed hundreds of flowers, small presents and cards. Many state employees had begun wearing black lapel pins to remember the three men who died. Jerry Nachtigal, the governor's press secretary, said Tuesday afternoon that the 45 to 50 employees who worked with Carnahan, 66, were ``devastated.'' ``It didn't matter if it was a cabinet oficial or a courier, in this office Governor Carnahan always had a kind word,'' Nachtigal said. ``He knew that person's first name and probably knew all his or her children as well. We were all very fond of Governor Carnahan.'' The governor had been expected at a campaign rally at 8 p.m. Monday in New Madrid, about 150 miles south of St. Louis. The twin-engine plane, a 1980 Cessna 335, disappeared from radar at 7:33 p.m., said Elizabeth Isham Cory, a spokeswoman for the Federal Aviation Administration. It crashed about 5 miles north of Hillsboro, the Jefferson County seat. Capt. Ed Kemp, of the Jefferson County sheriff's department, said witnesses reported hearing ``what sounded like an engine revving up in a dive, then they heard an explosion and saw a ball of fire.'' Also killed in the crash was Chris Sifford, 37, an adviser to Carnahan in his race to unseat Sen. John Ashcroft, a Republican. The plane was registered to Roger Carnahan's law firm, Carnahan Hickle &AMP; Calvert in Rolla, officials said. Cory said Roger Carnahan was an instrument-rated pilot who was licensed on July 31, 1988. Records show that neither he nor the plane had been involved in any prior accidents. Tuesday's search was made more difficult by what officials described as ``hilly, rough terrain.'' Carol Carmody, a spokeswoman for the National Transportation Safety Board, which is investigating the crash, said the agency's ``first priority is to identify the remains.'' Carnahan's plane crash revived memories of a similar plane crash involving another popular Missouri Democrat 24 years ago. It was an August election night in 1976. Jerry Litton, a two-term congressman from Chillicothe, was winning the Democratic primary for U.S. Senate. Shortly after taking off from Chillicothe for a short flight to Kansas City, the plane crashed into a field and burned. Litton, his wife, Sharon, their two children, the pilot and the pilot's son died. Pilot error and a problem with the plane's left engine were blamed. John C. Danforth, a Republican who at the time was Missouri's attorney general, won the election and remained in the Senate for 18 years. Across the state Tuesday night, residents expressed shock over Carnahan's death. Hardest hit by the news of the crash were the governor's supporters and staff. ``We're just stunned and saddened almost beyond belief. These were just two very fine men, both father and son,'' said William Hickle, Roger Carnahan's law partner. ``And it's just hard to lose them in such a tragic manner. We love them both very much.''

Almost forgotten in the euphoria of Yugoslavia's new democratic era are the losers _ the estimated 2 million people who voted for Slobodan Milosevic in the conviction that only he could save the nation. Now, as the majority who voted against Milosevic celebrates its victory, many of those who supported him are shutting out life rather than trying to make sense of a world turned upside down. Some stare blankly into space after turning from television or newspapers that used to lionize Milosevic but now vilify him. Others retreat into isolation, rebuffing attempts by family members to coax them into facing a new world with new leaders and values. ``Can you imagine, how the masses feel?'' said psychologist Zarko Trebjesanin. ``These are the people who were told the Milosevic can do nothing wrong for 13 years. Now, almost overnight, black is white and day is night.'' ``These people need help,'' Trebjesanin said. ``There are great mental breakdowns taking place across Serbia.'' Worst affected are the elderly, who embraced Milosevic and his message of Serbian superiority in the late 1980s with the death of another figure of authority, Communist leader Josip Broz Tito and the demise of another world they believed in _ his Yugoslavia of multinational tolerance. Milosevic's formula was simple. During his 13 years in power, his loyal state media pounded home one message; Slobo is Serbia, the dominant Yugoslav republic and Milosevic's past power base. Political opponents were labeled traitors and NATO spies. Kosovo Albanians were terrorists supported by the United States. As Serbia's isolation grew, so did the paranoiac conviction among millions of Milosevic supporters only he could save the nation. Now after losing Sept. 24 elections and being swept out of power by street protests, Milosevic is under virtual house arrest. His aides are being ousted. Milosevic's successor, President Vojislav Kostunica, hobnobs with yesterday's villains: representatives of the United States and other NATO nations that bombed Yugoslavia last year. And yesterday's ``rats, hyenas and lapdogs'' _ the shorthand used by the strongman's spin-doctors for opposition leaders _ now dominate television broadcasts with daily revelations of how the past regime duped the people for its own gain. Katarina, who spoke on condition her family name not be used, says her 72-year-old father-in-law devoured pro-Milosevic election programs in the weeks leading up to the elections. ``He hasn't watched since,'' she said. When Milosevic acknowledged losing Oct. 6, her father-in-law turned off the set, she said, and walked downstairs into his basement workshop, where he spends much of each day. He refuses to talk to his family after being laughed at for insisting Milosevic lost only because the CIA funneled billions of dollars to the opposition. ``He's in his own world,'' says Katarina. ``He is afraid to admit that Milosevic was wrong, because then he'd have to face the fact that his life was worth nothing.'' For the father-in-law of the psychologist Trebjesanin, the world fell apart while he was counting ballots as a helper at a Belgrade polling station. Kostunica won 800 ballots there to Milosevic's 320. ``He really didn't think Milosevic could lose,'' says Trebjesanin. ``It was a huge shock, but he couldn't escape it _ he saw it with his own eyes.'' Now, his wife's father is slowly coming around, as he starts to accept that past truths were lies. ``It's touching, really,'' Trebjesanin says. ``This man, several decades older than me, is like a child, telling us things that we adults had known for such a long time.'' Others, too, are grappling with the new realities. Soaking up the autumn sun on a bench in Belgrade's Kalemegdan park with fellow pensioners, Djuro says many cried when they learned of Milosevic's defeat, ``We never believed Slobo would lose,'' says Obrad, another retiree, who, like Djuro, asked that his last name not be used. ``Now we have to deal with a new world. ``If it's true what they say about Slobo, then maybe it's time for me to repent.''

Gov. Mel Carnahan's death in the crash of a small plane piloted by his son sent Missouri into mourning for the beloved politician Tuesday and cut short one of the hardest-fought Senate races in the nation. The twin-engine plane went down Monday night in rain and fog south of St. Louis en route to a campaign rally, killing the 66-year-old Carnahan, his 44-year-old son Roger Carnahan and an aide, Chris Sifford, 37. No one else was aboard. The Jefferson County Medical Examiner's Office identified the bodies of the governor and Sifford early Wednesday. The cause of the crash was not immediately known, but Federal Aviation Administration spokeswoman Elizabeth Isham Cory said the pilot reported a ``gyro problem'' shortly before the plane vanished from radar. A gyroscope is a dashboard instrument that helps the pilot with basic orientation and sense of horizon _ distinguishing level flight from banking, turning from straight and climbing from descent. Members of the National Transportation Safety Board said a report would take months to complete. Mourners gathered at the governor's mansion in Jefferson City shortly after daybreak as the news spread. ``He did so much for our state,'' said Susie Shultz, a state employee who brought red chrysanthemums. ``Mel Carnahan was the education man. He was for the right things.'' The two-term Democrat was locked in a tight and sometimes bitter Senate race with Republican Sen. John Ashcroft, who suspended campaign advertising and other operations after the crash. ``Obviously this is not a time for politics. This is a time for the state to come together,'' Ashcroft said. ``Gov. Carnahan served the people of Missouri with dignity and honor for more than four decades. I will remember him and all of Missouri will remember him for that exemplary public service and for his dedication to his family, as a husband, as a father and as a grandfather.'' There was talk of postponing the third presidential debate between Vice President Al Gore and Texas Gov. George W. Bush in St. Louis on Tuesday night. But Carnahan's wife, Jean, insisted it go on. She said her husband would have wanted it that way. In a statement, Bush praised Carnahan as ``a thoughtful, distinguished man who was dedicated to quality education and excellence in public service.'' Gore, who wore a black ribbon on his lapel, said he was ``deeply saddened'' and hailed Carnahan's work on education and other issues. The Cessna 335 took off from an airport in Cahokia, Ill., across the Mississippi River from St. Louis, for a 145-mile flight to New Madrid, where the governor was to attend a Monday night rally. Visibility at the time was three-fourths of a mile to two miles. The plane _ registered to a law firm where Roger Carnahan was a partner _ crashed 25 miles south of St. Louis in hilly, wooded country. Sifford had paged the state Democratic Party director and told him the plane had encountered lightning and would return to St. Louis or Jefferson City, state Sen. Jerry Howard said. Tom Hunter, who lives near the crash site, said he heard the plane flying overhead and thought it sounded like it was in a steep dive. ``I thought, `What a crazy person in this kind of weather,''' Hunter told St. Louis TV station KMOV. He said he heard an explosion and the sky turned red. ``That was it,'' he said. ``It was total silence. I told my wife to call 911.'' FAA spokesman Roland Herwig said there were no previous accidents, incidents or service difficulty reports on the 1980 Cessna. Roger Carnahan received his pilot's license in 1988 and was authorized to fly aircraft both by sight and using only instruments. ``He was as close as it comes to the top when it comes to training,'' Cory said. President Clinton called Carnahan's wife to express condolences while he was at the Mideast summit in Egypt. ``He's known him for a long time. They've worked together on a lot of issues,'' Clinton spokesman Jake Siewert said. Lt. Gov. Roger Wilson will serve out the remainder of Carnahan's term, until Jan. 8. The campaign, one of the key races in the Democrats' effort to retake control of the Senate, had been a dead heat for months. The most recent poll, taken for the St. Louis Post-Dispatch last month, gave Ashcroft 45 percent and Carnahan 43 percent, within the 4-point margin of error. Carnahan's name will stay on the Nov. 7 ballot because the deadline to change it has passed. If Carnahan receives the most votes, Wilson, a Democrat, can appoint a replacement to serve until the next general election, in November 2002. Carnahan, the son of a seven-term congressman, won his first public election at 26 as a municipal judge in his hometown of Rolla. He was elected to the Missouri House two years later and served two terms. He served as state treasurer, and was elected lieutenant governor in 1988. Four years later, he won the governor's office in a landslide and was re-elected in 1996. He was barred by state law from seeking a third consecutive term. The last governor to die in office was Florida's Lawton Chiles in 1998. The 68-year-old collapsed while exercising in the governor's mansion gymnasium. South Dakota Gov. George Mickelson died in 1993 when his state airplane slammed into a silo in Iowa. ___ On the Net: State government: http://www.gov.state.mo.us National Governors' Association: http://www.nga.org/subtocnga.htm Campaigns: http://www.johnashcroft.com and http://www.carnahan2000.com

Fidel Castro headed a march of nearly half the Cuban capital's population Wednesday to protest proposed U.S. legislation that it says will beef up rather than ease the nearly four-decade embargo against the communist island. After a military band played Cuba's national anthem, Castro began walking down Havana's Malecon coastal highway, flanked by other Cuban leaders. He wore white athletic shoes with his traditional olive green uniform. ``Down with the blockade!'' a series of young speakers chanted over a public address system set up outside the U.S. Interests Section, the American mission here. ``Long live the revolution!'' Castro, along with many of the other marchers, waved small red, white and blue Cuban flags as the mass of people snaked slowly past towering historic coastal buildings undergoing renovation, then on to a plaza outside the American mission. Bobbing above the crowd were placards bearing portraits of Cuban independence hero Jose Marti and Abraham Lincoln _ the latter a revered figure here for his liberation of American slaves. The Lincoln portraits were a reminder of Cuba's respect for certain American figures and its insistence that the proposed U.S. legislation would violate the rights of American farmers as well as all Americans who want to travel to the island. The Communist Party daily Granma on Wednesday called the mobilization of 800,000 people in this city of 2 million a response ``to the extreme U.S. right and the terrorist Cuban-American mafia'' for the ``sinister modifications'' in the proposed law that would allow Cuba to buy American food but severely restrict its ability to finance such purchases. Hundreds of thousands of citizens began mobilizing in the early morning hours after being exhorted at their schools, workplaces and neighborhoods to gather at specific sites detailed in the nation's newspapers. Cuban TV showed images of tens of thousands of people crammed into the streets around organization sites near Havana's coastal highways. The capital's banks and government offices were closed. While schools were not officially shut down, government media announced that children could accompany their parents to the march, which effectively meant that classes would be short on Wednesday if they were held at all. Already approved by the U.S. House, the bill set to go before the Senate this week would allow Cuba to buy food from American farmers for the first time in nearly 40 years. But Havana says that because of tight restrictions on financing and travel by Americans to the island, it will not spend a single cent on American food or medicine under the proposed law. Among Havana's biggest complaints are the tightened restrictions on U.S. travel to the island. Most U.S. citizens already are effectively barred from visiting Cuba because of spending restrictions under the trade embargo. Granma said it hoped the march would demonstrate to Americans the ``gross lie that the genocidal blockade has been softened.'' Cuban officials were pleased earlier this year about growing American support for an easing of the U.S. trade embargo that was imposed in 1962 in an attempt to squeeze Castro's government. But they see the current congressional legislation as a step back. ``Our country will not buy a single cent of food or medicine from the United States,'' read an editorial published Monday in state newspapers. ``In practice, it will be totally impossible to buy food and medicine from the United States'' under the financing restrictions, it added. The House approved the measure as part of a $78 billion spending bill. The legislation needs Senate approval before it goes to President Clinton, who has said he will sign it. Neither the federal government nor U.S. banks can finance the food sales, so Cuba would have to pay cash or get credit from a third country. Havana was pleased by the growing support among the American people to lift the trade embargo that surfaced during the seven-month battle to repatriate Elian Gonzalez, the 7-year-old boy who was returned to Cuba from the United States in June.

Hardly had the bomb debris settled on the USS Cole when the questions arose: Will the United States retaliate for an apparent terrorist attack that killed 17 Americans? If so, when and how? Before that can be known, another question must be answered: Who did it? At this point, no one seems to know. At a memorial service Wednesday at Norfolk Naval Station, Va., President Clinton said of the perpetrators: ``You will not find a safe harbor. We will find you and justice will prevail.'' There has been no credible claim of responsibility for the ship attack. The government of Yemen, whose port of Aden was the scene of the attack, said Tuesday its investigators found bomb-making equipment in a house near the port and believe two men who spent several days there are linked to the bombing. Security officials said the men, who disappeared, were non-Yemeni Arabs, possibly Saudis. The Clinton administration has not concluded definitively that the bombing was the work of terrorists, nor has it said explicitly that it will retaliate militarily. Defense Secretary William Cohen said the perpetrators would be found. ``To those who organized and orchestrated this barbarous act, you are on notice that our search for you will be relentless, that America will not rest until we find you and the long arm of justice reaches out, however long, however far, and makes you pay for this crime,'' Cohen said at the memorial service. Although many people expect U.S. military retaliation, the record shows that in many cases of international terrorism the Clinton administration has sought legal prosecution, not military retaliation. ``Military retaliation is very difficult to do, especially if you can't retaliate against a state,'' said Vincent Cannistraro, a retired CIA officer and counterterrorism expert. ``It is not necessarily a good counterterrorism tool.'' In the aftermath of the 1988 terrorist bombing of Pan Am flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, the United Nations, and the United States independently, imposed economic sanctions. Three years of investigative work led to the indictment of two Libyan intelligence agents, who are now on trial in the Netherlands. But there was no U.S. military response. A notable exception was Clinton's decision in August 1998 to launch cruise missiles at a suspected chemical weapons factory in Sudan and against terrorist training camps in Afghanistan affiliated with Osama bin Laden, the well-financed Saudi exile whose organization, al Qaida, the United States calls a global terrorist network. Washington accused bin Laden of masterminding the Aug. 7 bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania which killed 224 people, including 12 Americans. The August 1998 retaliation failed to hit bin Laden and created a lot of headaches for the White House. For example, the owner of the Sudan pharmaceutical plant destroyed in the attack is suing the U.S. government for $50 million on grounds that his factory was targeted on false charges of having terrorist links. In a statement published Tuesday in a Pakistani newspaper, bin Laden cautioned the United States not to attack him in Afghanistan. ``The dream to kill me will never be completed,'' bin Laden was quoted as saying. ``I am not afraid of the American threats against me. As long as I am alive there will be no rest for the enemies of Islam. I will continue my mission against them.'' Cannistraro said the attack on the USS Cole has the earmarks of an operation by bin Laden's organization, but he questions whether investigators will find enough evidence. The boat believed to have detonated the bomb is said to have been shredded into confetti-sized pieces, and other physical evidence may be hard to find. The attack on the Cole was the deadliest against a U.S. military target since a truck bomb ripped through a U.S. Air Force housing complex in Saudi Arabia, killing 19 troops. After that attack, Clinton said, ``I'll do everything in my power to discover who's responsible, to pursue them and to punish them.'' There has been no U.S. military retaliation for that attack, but Cohen says there has been accountability. He said Saudi Arabia convicted five people in the case and they are awaiting sentencing. ``So there has been accountability for those five,'' Cohen said. ``We will continue to search for others.''

From NPR news in Washington, I am Frank Stasio. President Clinton today offered comfort to the sailors and the families of the USS Cole. He praised the 17 sailors who were killed in an attack on the Cole that was docked in a port in Yemen. The President addressed a memorial ceremony at Norfolk Naval Air Station. Today we honor our finest young people, fallen soldiers who rose to freedoms challenge. We mourn their loss, celebrate their lives, and offer the love and prayers of a grateful nation to their families. Campaigning today in Wisconsin, George W bush also praised the fallen sailors. These young American's lived for a cause and died with a purpose. They were patriots and we're deeply in their debt. This tragedy is a reminder that peace is always fragile, the risk is always real, and hate in this world does not sleep. The Navy says the bodies of two more American sailors have been recovered from the Cole, the search continues for 4 others believed to be still aboard the destroyer. The 2 additional remains will be flown to Dover air base in Delaware along with the six bodies recovered yesterday.

A memorial service was held, Wednesday at the Norfolk, Virginia naval station for the 17 sailors who died in the apparent suicide attack on the US Navy destroyer 'Cole'. President Clinton spoke of his grief at the loss of the sailors. Today we honor our finest young people, fallen soldiers who rose to freedom's challenge. We moan their loss, celebrate their lives, offer the love and prayers of a grateful nation to their families. Mr. Clinton also promised that those who carried out the attack on the USS Cole will be found. The Republican presidential challenger, George W.

The US Senate has passed the bill allowing food and medicine sales to Cuba potentially easing 40-year-old trade sanctions against the communist ruled island. The measure now goes on to President Clinton who said he will sign it. It allows Cuba to buy food and medicine from the United States for the first time since 1962, but the bill restricts US financing of such sales and also continues a US travel ban to Cuba. The bill is meant to ease the trade sanctions, but Cuba says, the financial conditions will make it impossible to buy US food. Cuba's communist party officials have vowed not to spend one cent on US goods. President Fidel Castro Wednesday led a massive protest rally in Havana against the bill's restrictions. We have more on that story on our Dateline segment later in this hour.

On the campaign trail, Republican presidential nominee George W. Bush is pledging to take a tough line against terrorists like the ones who bombed the USS Cole last week. VOA's David Swan reports. Mr. Bush joined President Clinton in paying tribute to 17 sailors who died when a terrorist bomb ripped open their ship. Speaking at a campaign stop at Wisconsin, the Governor said those responsible must be punished and he vowed to strike back if anything like this happens on his watch. Best way to stop terrorism is to send a chilling message. Yeah. Somebody would say what's that message going to be? And I'd say well, should I be the President, those who committed the act of terrorism we are going to find out and they are not going to like it. Mr. Bush also promised to bring a new tone to Washington in other ways to end what he calls a cynicism in name calling of the Clinton years. As he did on Tuesday night's televised debate, the Governor labeled his Democratic rival Al Gore, an agent of a bloated Federal government. The Bush campaign is quoting undecided and independent voters here in Wisconsin, one of several usually Democratic states where Republicans now believe they can win. David Swan, VOA News, Oklia, Wisconsin. Meanwhile, Mr. Gore promoted his program of more responsive government in Iowa and Michigan. The latest opinion polls indicate the two candidates are virtually tied.

Thank you Dave. I'm Tom Crosby with David Chadwick. This is VOA News now. Forty-years ago today, the US reacted to the seizure of US owned assets by the Cuban government of Fidel Castro by applying a trade embargo on Cuba. Over time Washington has made changes to the sanctions sometimes making them more stringent, other times easing them to allow increased personal and business contacts. Wednesday, Congress passed and sent to President Clinton a new legislation that again modifies the sanctions. Mr. Clinton has said he will sign the legislation, but the basic restrictions remain in place, a symbol of US opposition to the Castro regime. Today on Dateline, we look at the US embargo on Cuba forty years after it was first put in place. Here is Dave Arlington. On the surface, the new legislation allows US businesses to sell food and medicine to Cuba. Lawmakers from farming states have been pushing for such a change. However, the embargo may remain as tight as ever. Following months of negotiations on Capitol Hill, Republican leaders agree to tack on restrictions that Cuban officials say would make it totally impossible to buy food and medicine from the United States. In protest, Fidel Castro led hundreds of thousands of Cubans on a march through the streets of Havana on Wednesday. VOA correspondent, Paula Wolfson followed the bill's progress through Congress. Florida Republican Lincoln Dias Ballard represents the Cuban-American community in Miami, where support for the sanctions is strong. When the House and Senate voted separately earlier this year to lift the ban on sales of food and medicine, Mr. Dias Ballard went into action. Along with like-minded colleagues in the legislature, he convinced House Republican leaders to change the bill in negotiations with the Senate. The result is a very different measure. The compromise authorizes sales of United States agricultural commodities to the Cuban regime, but without American financing. Technically, the bill ends all US food and medicine embargoes now in effect against Cuba, Libya, North Korea, Sudan and Iran, but Cuba is singled out. The cash-strapped Cubans have permission to buy the goods, but they can't obtain credit in the United States. The bill also puts into US law current restrictions on travel to Cuba, depriving the Castro government of American tourist revenues. Come between James McGovern, a Massachusetts's Democrat, says the Republican leadership is going against the expressed will of the House and the Senate. The Cuba provision in this bill hurts American farmers, it hurts American bankers and it is an insult to the American people. The bill put farm-state Republicans in a tough position. They originally fought to lift the sanctions without conditions, but when the final version of the legislation came up for debate, South Carolina's Mark Sanford spoke out against his party's leadership. I think that this Cuba deal is fatally flawed in that it perpetuates basically the dark ages when it comes to Cuba. But the first Republican in the House to call for an end to the food and medicine embargo was philosophical. Washington State Congressman, George Nethercut said the bill is a classic compromise. It gives us a chance to lift sanctions on food and medicine for countries that we've previously sanctioned for all these years. Is it perfect? No, it's not perfect. I wish I had it a different way in some respects for my purposes, but that's not the nature of this system. Paula Wolfman, VOA News, Capitol Hill. Kenneth Rhodman, of Maine's Kolby College is an expert on the impact of economic sanctions. According to Professor Rhodman, US policy toward Cuba is only changing at the margins despite greater support today among the American people for easing or ending the Cuban embargo. Public opinion has been more supportive of easing the embargo, but congressional policy on Cuban sanctions does not have to do with diffused public attitude. It has to do with interest group politics and the groups that have ultimately mattered the most and have cared the most about this issue are the Cuban American National Foundation and their allies within Congress. So this is, I think, one of those cases of American public policy where concentrated interests that are intensely committed to a particular issue tend to override more diffused public attitude. Has there been a drop in the influence of the Cuban American lobbies following the Elian Gonzalez controversy? I would say over the last two years there has been a drop in the influence of the Cuban American National Foundation. They are overplaying their hands in the Elian Gonzalez case as one part of this. A few other factors that have played into this were the Pope's visits to Cuba, the fact that business has more aggressively mobilized against unilateral sanctions like the Cuban embargo. And agricultural groups and their allies within Congress have really been in the forefront of trying to ease the Cuban embargo, to make it more difficult for the executive branch to use food as an instrument of foreign policy. Well, here Cuba is a socialist dictatorship in the midst of the largely Democratic states of the Americas, right on the doorstep of the United States. Doesn't it deserve special US attention? Well, but special US attention in what way? The question is whether you're more likely to implement change through a more flexible policy of encouraging trade or perhaps establishing codes of conduct for foreign investors going into Cuba, rather than just rationing up the economic pressure. A strong argument could be made that the embargo gives Castro a foreign scapegoat for the economic problems that he is responsible for. At the same time, many would argue that increasing trade with Cuba and repressive regimes in general will encourage forces within Cuba that will weaken Cuban control. I mean, that's the logic we use in our policy with respect to China. The counter argument is that totalitarian regimes have the ability to control the access of outsiders, so that business opportunities work to strengthen the regime rather than weaken the regime and you know, I think that's true as well. Professor Rhodman says he believes the arguments made on both sides for sanctions and for engagement have been largely overstated. But meanwhile the rest of the world has come down solidly on one side of the question. In a non-binding vote, last November for example, the United Nations opposed the US embargo 155 to 2 with eight abstentions. Professor Rhodman says, since the mid 1970s, Washington has been alone in trying to isolate Cuba. He says this lack of support helped bring about a controversial change to the sanctions at a time in 1996 when the issue was especially emotional. Cuban fighter jets had shot down two private planes over the Florida Straits killing four members of Americas Cuban exiled community. In response, President Clinton signed the Helms Burton law, which would penalize foreign companies investing in Cuba if any of the assets involved had belonged to US interest before they were nationalized by the Cuban government. In Professor Rhodman's words, the law tried to coerce third parties into supporting US unilateral sanctions. He says it also made another significant change. The embargo is now a matter of legislative statute. It's not simply dependent upon an executive order and that means the President can't lift in the embargo when he sees it in his interest. To use an analogy, the initial sanctions against China after the communist revolution and the Korean war were enacted by executive order. If they were a congressional statute, that would have meant that when Nixon was exploring the opening to China in the late 60s- early 70s, he would not have been able to flexibly ease some sanctions as a way of signaling the Chinese that we are interested in some kind of opening. Helms Burton basically makes the Cuban embargo the law of the land and it limits the discretion of any President, Clinton or Gore or Bush, to flexibly fine-tune those sanctions to events that are taking place within Cuba. So it will forever be a problem within Congress? Congress may make some revisions of the embargo on, like we're seeing right now, but in my view given the changes created by Helms Burton, the embargo will not disappear until you have fundamental political change within Cuba. That, Professor Rhodman says, could be delayed until the death of 74-year-old Fidel Castro. Kenneth Rhodman of Kolby College is the author of 'Sanctions Beyond Borders,' a book about the effectiveness of US sanctions around the world which will be published in early 2001. He helped us examine the US embargo against Cuba, first implemented 40 years ago today. For Dateline, I'm Dave Arlington.

Crew members of the USS Cole worked to restore their damaged warship and searched for the bodies of those still missing Wednesday, even as Americans back home paid tribute at a memorial service to 17 sailors who died in the explosion. U.S. and Yemeni authorities are investigating the apparent suicide bombing. A 12-year-old Yemeni boy provided a lead in the investigation, Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh said Wednesday in a television interview. At the tearful service in Norfolk, Va., President Clinton mourned the dead and sternly warned those who organized the Oct. 12 attack. ``You will not find a safe harbor, for we will find you and justice will prevail,'' he said. Aboard the Cole, sailors who held a small memorial on Sunday continued bailing water from the crippled vessel and searching for the bodies of four crew members still missing. ``They are trying to finish their job, trying to find the remains,'' said Lt. Terrence Dudley, a spokesman for the U.S. 5th Fleet. Eight bodies pulled from the wreckage on Tuesday were flown to the United States, Navy officials said. Five recovered earlier have already been returned for burial. Most of the 39 sailors injured in the blast have returned to the United States, though two were being treated at a U.S. military hospital in Germany. The investigation is focused on an Aden neighborhood surrounding an apartment where police found bomb-making equipment on Monday. Neighbors said police had questioned the landlord and a real estate agent who found the apartment for two men who have been missing since the attack. Yemeni officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, identified the possible suspects only as non-Yemeni Arabs. A Yemeni boy told authorities that a bearded man wearing glasses gave him small change and told him to watch his car near the port on the day of the bombing, Saleh said Wednesday, on the popular Arab satellite news station Al-Jazeera. According to the child, the man then took to the sea in a rubber boat he had carried atop the car, and did not return, Saleh said. Yemeni police were apparently able to trace the man back to the apartment. Officials believe a small rubber boat packed with explosives was maneuvered next to the Cole by two suicide bombers and then detonated. Moments before the blast, two men were seen standing on the deck of a small vessel alongside the destroyer, U.S. authorities said. A 40-by-40-foot hole was blown into the Cole's hull and the small boat disintegrated into ``confetti size'' pieces. The independent Yemeni newspaper Al Ayyam reported Wednesday that the landlord said he rented the apartment for a month to at least one non-Yemeni Arab with an unspecified Gulf accent. Al Ayyam said police determined one tenant gave the landlord forged identification. The paper said the tenants parked a fiberglass boat near the apartment yard. The boat was now missing. Yemeni officials would give no further information on the explosives material found in the apartment. They said the missing men arrived in Yemen four days before the attack. Saleh defended Yemen's role in the investigation, bristling at an interviewer's suggestion that it was dominated by Americans. He also said Yemen would not allow any of its citizens to be interrogated by U.S. investigators, as a matter of ``sovereignty.'' A senior U.S. administration official said U.S. FBI director Louis Freeh believes the government of Yemen ``is now cooperating fully and genuinely'' in the investigation. Freeh told the White House he was heading for Yemen as part of the investigation. The bombing, for which no one has claimed responsibility, may be the deadliest terrorist attack on the U.S. military since the 1996 bombing of an Air Force barracks in Saudi Arabia that killed 19.

The son of Gov. Mel Carnahan, piloting his father's ill-fated plane, told air traffic controllers the craft was malfunctioning minutes before it crashed, investigators said Wednesday. Carnahan, 66, died when the Cessna 335 crashed Monday night in a hilly area south of St. Louis. Also killed were his son Roger, 44, and his chief aide, Chris Sifford, 37. The cause has not been determined. Details of communication between Roger Carnahan and the control tower at Lambert Airport in St. Louis were released Wednesday by the National Transportation Safety Board. The twin-engine six-seater took off just before 7 p.m. from Parks Airport in Cahokia, Ill., near St. Louis, heading for a fund-raiser in New Madrid through rainy, foggy conditions. At 7:20 p.m., Roger Carnahan said he was having trouble with the artificial horizon, which is used to judge whether the plane is tilting. Two minutes later, he sought permission to turn to the west toward an airport in Jefferson City. Six minutes later, at 7:28 p.m., Roger Carnahan told controllers he was still having trouble and was trying to switch to visual flight rules, which means he was trying to find a path clear enough to fly by sight. Air traffic control told him ``to just keep heading west'' to avoid fog and rain. The pilot said he was heading west, and then the tower lost radar contact with the plane at 7:33. NTSB investigators have found a football-sized piece of the plane's engine more than a quarter-mile away from most of the plane's wreckage, something agency spokeswoman Carol Carmody called unusual. The investigation could take months. The aircraft had a clean track record, as did Roger Carnahan, an amateur pilot with more than 1,600 hours of flying experience. Earlier Wednesday, Lt. Gov. Roger Wilson officially took over leadership of the state after a medical examiner identified the remains of Mel Carnahan and Sifford. Wilson, like Carnahan, is a Democrat. He was sworn in as Missouri's 52nd governor at a brief ceremony after midnight attended by his family, Carnahan's staff and state lawmakers. He will serve out the rest of Carnahan's term, which ends Jan. 8. ``The people of Missouri have my pledge that I will do everything I can ... to make Missouri as productive as possible and a great place to live,'' said Wilson, who became lieutenant governor in 1992 and was re-elected in 1996. Mel Carnahan had been battling Republican Sen. John Ashcroft in one of the nation's tightest Senate races. Carnahan's name will stay on the Nov. 7 ballot because the deadline to change it has passed. If Carnahan receives the most votes, Wilson can appoint a replacement to serve until the next general election, in November 2002. Carnahan's casket will lie in state at the Governor's Mansion on Thursday for public visitation. President Clinton is expected to attend a memorial service Friday outside the Capitol in Jefferson City. ___ On the Net: State government: http://www.gov.state.mo.us National Governors' Association: http://www.nga.org/subtocnga.htm Campaigns: http://www.johnashcroft.com and http://www.carnahan2000.com

thanks for looking in. here's the top story -- all the bodies of the 17 crew members killed in the attack on the "uss cole" have been recovered as congress joins in the investigation into the blast. eight of the bodies should arrive tomorrow at dover air force base in delaware. pentagon officials say the last four sets of remains were recovered today and will follow in a second plane. the victims were found over the last three days by search teams cutting through the damaged interior of the ship. the first five bodies recovered were flown home last weekend. investigators in yemen say they're making progress in the hunt for whoever was behind the attack on the "cole." walter rodgers updates the developments in the case. forensic efforts paddle a rubber dinghy through the blast hole and float inside the crippled destroyer "uss cole." officials say the investigation is making good progress, though it will take time to develop significant evidence to say who launched the attack on the u.s. warship. those on board say the scene inside is nothing short of catastrophic. the american fbi directer louis freeh described the blast scene. moved decks literally around. so it is a tangled mass of metal and wire. yemeni officials and the fbi director say there's been considerable progress in developing evidence. a senior u.s. official confirmed several locations have been found where the bombers operated from and they say several people were involved. yemen's president is pointing a finger in the direction of afghanistan. they are elements from al-jihad returning from afghanistan. president saleh says he thinks they are part of a group returning from afghanistan and he said yemen has identified a number of eyewitnesss. the americans have used the name osama bin laden. do you believe he's involved? "maybe," he replayed. it is much too early in the case to come to that conclusion. we have some theories as you almost have to have when you begin an investigation of this kind. off the coast of yemen, a marine carrier stands by, providing support and protection during the salvage operation. the attack on the destroyer testifies to afundamental change in the nature of terrorism. officials here say perpetrators are far less likely to claim responsibility. rather, they say, the motivation of the case may simply have been to kill large numbers of americans. walter rodgers, cnn, aden, yemen. u.s. senators are asking why the "cole" was being refueled at the port in yemen in the first place. retired general anthony zinni added yemen to the list of refueling spots when he served as the u.s. regional commander for the middle east. he told the senate armed services committee today it was a strategic decision. he says it had nothing to do with improving relations with yemen.

The Yemeni coastline, where the USS Cole met disaster in an apparent terrorist bombing last week, is a ``sieve'' for terrorists but was the best option available for refueling Navy ships in the volatile region, the former U.S. military commander in the region said Thursday. Gen. Anthony Zinni, who was commander in chief of U.S. Central Command at the time the Pentagon contracted for refueling services in the Yemeni port of Aden in December 1998, took responsibility for the decision. ``I pass that buck on to nobody,'' Zinni told a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing. Zinni, who retired earlier this year, said he and the rest of the American government were well aware that terrorists use Yemen as a transit route into Saudi Arabia. ``Their coast is a sieve,'' he said. Yet there were no better alternatives and Navy ships must refuel in that area while moving to and from the Persian Gulf, Zinni said. The port of Djibouti, on the Horn of Africa and just across the Gulf of Aden from Yemen, had been used but the refueling contract there was terminated in about 1997 because the facilities were unsatisfactory and ``the threat conditions were far worse.'' That left him with ``options that were not very good,'' Zinni said.

Investigators widened their probe into the bombing of the USS Cole to Saudi Arabia and to a far eastern Yemeni province known for its outlaw tribes, Yemeni officials said Thursday as the FBI director arrived and toured the warship. FBI director Louis Freeh held talks with Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh and later told a news conference that his agency is supporting Yemen's investigation in a ``junior'' role and is in the country by invitation. He complimented Yemeni authorities' police work in the case. The devastation has slowed recovery of the dead. A 14th body was pulled from the wreckage Thursday, U.S. officials said. The search for the last three missing and presumed dead continued. Freeh said he toured the U.S. warship, which was attacked as it arrived to refuel Oct. 12, and described the crime scene as a ``tangled mess of metal and wire.'' The FBI director said it was far too early to speculate who may have sponsored or be responsible for the bombing, which killed 17 sailors and injured 39. ``We are looking at this with an open mind,'' he said. Saleh, in an interview with CNN, said ``it could be'' when asked if Osama Bin-Laden was behind the attack on the USS Cole. He also said it was possible that ``elements from Afghanistan'' were involved. Freeh would not commit to that possibility. He said determining exactly who carried out the attack ``will be governed by facts and forensics,'' adding that ``we are far from making even preliminary judgments on this.'' Yemeni security officials said Thursday that a search earlier this week of an Aden apartment where bomb-making equipment was found also yielded documents they believe originated in Hadhramaut, an eastern Yemeni province. A vehicle believed used by the attackers also contained documents traced to Hadhramaut, the officials said on condition of anonymity. They said investigators were dispatched Thursday to Hadhramaut, seeking more information to try to identify two men who used the Aden apartment and who have not been seen since the bombing. Hadhramaut, a conservative region along the eastern border with Oman, is home to lawless tribes that have kidnapped foreigners for ransom. Yemeni officials said another team of investigators was going to neighboring Saudi Arabia on Thursday. The officials provided no information on the leads that took them there. Many Yemenis from Hadhramaut have settled in Saudi Arabia. Investigators also were questioning the owner of a welding shop who had done welding for the suspects, security officials said without elaborating. The landlord of the Aden apartment and a real estate agent who found the apartment for the two men also have been questioned. Yemeni officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, identified the possible suspects only as non-Yemeni Arabs. A 12-year-old Yemeni boy told authorities that a bearded man wearing glasses gave him small change and told him to watch his car near the port on the day of the bombing, Saleh said Wednesday on the popular Arab satellite news station Al-Jazeera. According to the child, the man then took to the sea in a rubber boat he had carried atop the car, and did not return, Saleh said. Yemeni police were apparently able to trace the man back to the apartment. Officials believe a small rubber boat packed with explosives was maneuvered next to the Cole by two suicide bombers and then detonated. At a tearful service in Norfolk, Va., President Clinton mourned the dead and sternly warned those who organized the attack. ``You will not find a safe harbor, for we will find you and justice will prevail,'' he said Wednesday. Sailors aboard the Cole had held a small memorial on Sunday. On Wednesday, they continued bailing water from the crippled vessel and searching for the bodies of four crew members still missing. The apparent death toll of 17 in the bombing, for which no one has claimed responsibility, makes it the deadliest terrorist attack on the U.S. military since the 1996 bombing of an Air Force barracks in Saudi Arabia that killed 19. In Washington, Gen. Anthony Zinni, who was commander in chief of U.S. Central Command at the time the Pentagon contracted for refueling services in Aden in December 1998, took responsibility for the decision to send the ship there. ``I pass that buck on to nobody,'' Zinni told a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing. He said the Yemeni coastline is a ``sieve'' for terrorists but was the best option available for refueling Navy ships in the volatile region. There has been no claim of responsibility for the Cole bombing that is considered credible. Thursday, the London-based newspaper Al Hayat published a statement by Egyptian militant leader Rifai Ahmed Taha citing the Cole explosion and calling for more attacks on U.S. interests. ``Our soldiers, officers and sons in Egypt should learn a lesson from the American destroyer in Aden, since they have the Suez Canal before their eyes where dozens of American Jewish ships cross,'' said the statement attributed to Taha. Taha's al-Gamaa al-Islamiya, or Islamic Group, is held responsible for the 1997 massacre of Western tourists in Luxor, Egypt. Taha now is believed in hiding in Afghanistan with Osama bin Laden, a Saudi dissident of Yemeni descent. Bin Laden is accused in the 1998 bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania that killed 224 people. Bin Laden recruited Yemenis, along with other Arabs, to fight alongside Afghans against Soviet invaders. After the 1989 Soviet withdrawal, many radicalized, battle-hardened Yemeni veterans returned home. Yemeni official say they are questioning Afghan veterans in the Cole bombing.

in yemen today, navy divers cut through the deck of the "uss cole" to remove the last four sailors who died in the attack. their bodies will head home tomorrow. on capitol hill today, senators were asking the general who sent the "uss cole" into the port of aden in yemen, why he made that decision. here's abc's john m wethy. the man who opened the door for american warships to use the port of aden made no apologies today. the refueling of that ship in aden was my decision. i want to be clear. i pass that buck on to nobody. the one question all of us keep hearing, why yemen? the threat conditions in aden the specific threat conditions, were actually better than we had elsewhere. general zinni said all her ports, from the suez canal to the persian gulf, had their own problems, either credible terrorists threats, unstable governments, or harbors jaed with small boats. plus, the government of yemen wanted better relations with the u.s. and had begun taking steps to control local terrorist activity. but improved relations, zinni gued, did not blind the u. to the risks. i don't want anyone to think we ever in any instance, anywhere, ever took a risk for the purpose of a better relationship with a country and put a soldier, sailor, airman or marine at risk for that reason, absolutely not. some republican senators wondered why the "cole" and other ships were not routinely taking the far safer approach of refueling at sea? i think i'm hearing you say, "we don't have enough tankers to be sure that we could do that." that's my sense, senator. the general had one more troubling message. terrorists are getting smarter, using nastier wep yauns, and as long as they are willing to die in their attacks, it will be virtually impossible to stop them all. john m wethy, abc news, the pentagon.

tom, u.s. officials tonight are assessing new threats made against american warships in the middle east. this latest threat calls for more terrorist bombings like that against the "uss cole," but steskically on the "cole," but specifically targets american and israeli ships in the suez canal. it comes from egyptian militant rifai ahmed taha, seen here with terrorist osama bin laden in a video tape that threatens attacks on americans in yemen released only three weeks before the "cole" is hit. why yemen? meanwhile, on capitol hill, lawmakers want to know why u.s. warships refuel in yemen at all, since it's known as a hotbed of terrorism. retired marine corps general anthony zinni said he made the decision to improve military ties with yemen and because -- the threat conditions in aden the specific threat conditions were actually better than anywhere else. but a state department report says in the last two years, there have been 35 significant terrorist incidents in yemen. and yemen is one of only four countries in the world where terrorist attacks against americans have increased -- 52%. it's sort of like the wild, wild west. there is no central authority. at the same time, the pentagon launches its own investigation to determine what, if anything, went wrong with security for the "cole." we will never have a perfect defense against terrorism. but we need to make our defenses as good as they can be. but too late for the "cole." tonight, the navy has finished recovering all remains of the 17 sailors killed in the sneak attack. officials here new about the bin laden warning before the "cole" was attacked. the threat was considered so nonspecific, u.s. warships were not put on a higher state of alert. tom? thanks very much, nbc's jim miklaszewski tonight.

terrorism is such a threat to the united states, and it knows no boundaries, so the role of the fbi has expanded worldwide. the director of the fbi, louis freeh, has gone to yemen to personally supervise the investigation. and nbc's pete williams has the latest. the fbi director arrives in yemen to find an investigation surprisingly well advanced, thanks in lar part, he says, to aggressive work by local police. i complimented the president and the yemeni authorities for the very good investigative work they have done, particularly in finding those locations which we feel may be relevant to the case. in fact , fbi agents are checking out a chain of discoveries that begin shortly after an explosion. a 12-year-old boy reports seeing a man launch a rubber boat from a car parked at the harbor. fbi officials find what they believe may be explosives in the car. yemeni police trace the car to a nearby house. the fbi finds traces of explosives on clothes found neighbors say they saw two men who they describe as "arab-looking" living there for several weeks. police also find a second house where authorities believe two others may have assembled the bomb, possibly doing some welding. passports found in one of the houses identify the men as from a privilege convenience province noted for lawless tribes. but the documents turn out to be fakes. meantime, analysts at the fbi crime lab try to discover what the bomb was made from. no conclusions yet, u.s. officials say. but a working theory, plastic explosive. but yemen's president says the fbi has told him the explosive material could only have come from the u.s., israel or two arab countries. and to a former federal bomb investigator, that description suggests a powerful military-style plastic explosive c-4 that can be cut or molded into different shapes. it is a very powerful explosive, one of the most powerful explosives found in bulk, demolition bulks, for example. as but with no clear evidence of who ordered the bombing -- one that yemen's president calls, "an octopus of an operation, planned for a long time." pete williams, nbc news, washington.

Arab foreign ministers said Thursday that they want peace with Israel but need to review whether the current negotiations process is the best way to achieve it. ``It is obvious that peace means the return of all occupied Arab lands,'' Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa said, opening a two-day meeting to prepare for a weekend conference of heads of state. He said he and his counterparts must emerge from their meeting with a suggested plan ``to achieve this main goal'' and pass it along to their leaders for the summit. There were calls for an end to relations with Israel in the wake of three weeks of deadly Israeli-Palestinian fighting, but the emphasis seemed to be on finding a more constructive approach. ``It is natural that here we are to speak about peace and not about something else,'' Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa said. But he stressed that Israel could not dictate the terms of peace, and accused Israel of derailing the peace process. Nabil Shaath, Palestinian minister of planning and international cooperation, expressed his thanks for the support the Palestinian people have received. He also called on Arabs to use their economic might, suggesting that oil industry contracts be granted to companies that support the Arabs in their conflict with Israel. ``We need to say that we can use all our political and economic tools to achieve this goal. ... We need to use our pressure cards to keep the Palestinian people alive,'' Shaath said. In Syria, President Bashar Assad urged the international community to ``intervene to force Israel to recognize the rights of the Palestinian people,'' the official Syrian Arab News Agency said. Assad made the comments in a telephone conversation with Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien, it said. Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak called the summit after the outbreak of clashes between Palestinians and Israeli security forces that have killed more than 100 people, mostly Palestinians. It follows another summit hosted by Mubarak, an Israeli-Palestinian meeting in the Egyptian resort of Sharm el-Sheik that yielded a fragile truce agreement Tuesday.

A 12-year-old Yemeni boy who says a man paid him to watch his car, then took to sea in a small boat and never returned has provided investigators with a key early lead in their search for clues about what happened to the USS Cole. Authorities have been focusing on two men who rented an Aden apartment where bomb-making material was later found. The two have not been seen since the U.S. warship was bombed Oct. 12 as it arrived in Aden to refuel, killing 17 sailors and injuring 39. The Navy announced Thursday that it recovered the last four bodies of sailors killed in the blast. Thirteen bodies already had been flown to the United States, and the final four will be returned home soon. FBI director Louis Freeh, in Yemen for talks with President Ali Abdullah Saleh, said determining exactly who carried out the attack would be a challenge. The crime scene he toured Thursday was a ``tangled mess of metal and wire,'' he said. Officials believe two suicide bombers maneuvered a small boat packed with explosives next to the Cole and then detonated it. The witnesses being questioned include the owner of a welding shop who did work for the suspects, Yemeni security officials said, speaking on condition of anonymity. The landlord of the apartment and a real estate agent who found it for the men also have been questioned. The 12-year-old boy told authorities a bearded man wearing glasses gave him small change and told him to watch his car near the port on the day of the bombing, Saleh said Wednesday on the Arab satellite news station Al-Jazeera. According to the boy, the man then went to sea in a small boat he carried atop the car and did not return, Saleh said. Yemeni police apparently were able to trace the man to the Aden apartment. Yemeni security officials said Thursday the apartment yielded documents they believe originated in Hadhramaut, a region along the eastern border with Oman that is home to lawless tribes that have kidnapped foreigners for ransom. A vehicle believed to have been used by the attackers also contained documents traced to Hadhramaut, the Yemeni officials said. They said investigators were sent to the region Thursday. Yemeni officials said another team of investigators was going to neighboring Saudi Arabia on Thursday. Many Yemenis from Hadhramaut have settled there. There has been no claim of responsibility for the Cole bombing that is considered credible. Saleh, in an interview with CNN Thursday, said ``it could be'' when asked if Saudi dissident Osama bin Laden _ whom the United States accuses of masterminding the 1998 bombings of its embassies in Kenya and Tanzania that killed 224 people _ was behind the attack on the USS Cole. Freeh said it was far too early to speculate. A Taliban official in Afghanistan said Arab militants who met with bin Laden in late September left the country just four days before the attack on the Cole. The official, who is close to the security apparatus of the Taliban religious militia that controls nearly all of Afghanistan, asked not to be identified for his own safety. He said bin Laden _ who lives in exile in Afghanistan _ met with members of the Palestinian Hamas movement and the Egyptian Jihad. He gave military code names for the participants, but it wasn't possible to determine their identities. A second meeting involving 10 Arabs who arrived via Moscow, held just after the bombing, discussed the possibility of organizing attacks on U.S. embassies around the world, particularly in the Middle East, the official said. It was impossible to independently confirm the meetings took place or who might have participated. On Thursday, the London-based newspaper Al Hayat published a statement by Egyptian militant leader Rifai Ahmed Taha citing the Cole explosion and calling for more attacks on U.S. interests. Taha's al-Gamaa al-Islamiya, or Islamic Group, is blamed for a 1997 massacre of Western tourists in Luxor, Egypt. Taha now is believed to be in hiding in Afghanistan with bin Laden. Bin Laden recruited Yemenis and other Arabs to fight Soviet troops in Afghanistan in the 1980s. After the 1989 Soviet withdrawal, many battle-hardened Yemenis returned home. Yemeni officials say they are questioning Afghan veterans. Retired U.S. Gen. Anthony Zinni, the military commander in the region when the Pentagon contracted for refueling services at Aden in 1998, told a Senate committee hearing Thursday that he knew terrorists used Yemen as a transit route into Saudi Arabia but that there were no better alternatives. Navy ships had to refuel in the area while moving to and from the Persian Gulf, he said. The Aden neighborhood that is home to the apartment at the center of the investigation is known as Buraika and overlooks a beautiful bay. Senior Yemeni government officials and military officers live there. One neighbor pointed out the apartment, on the first floor of a small white house with an unfinished second story. Five police officers stood outside, behind a low wall around the front yard. Seif Salim al Murousi, who lives nearby, said he remembered only that one tenant was bearded and he had occasionally seen them wearing traditional Yemeni dress, a brightly colored wrap similar to a sarong.

Britain's going to establish diplomatic relations with North Korea. Foreign Secretary Robin Cook made the announcement on his arrival in the South Korean capital, Seoul. But Cook says establishing ties with North Korea doesn't mean London will turn a blind eye to human rights abuses in the country. We have diplomatic relations around the world, we are going to find out who is a human rights breaker, we have very deep and very real concerns. The advantage of having diplomatic relations is that we can have a direct dialogue in which we can raise these concerns and express our deep anxiety for the need of improvement in them. Cook says the South Korean leadership is keen on international help in bringing its northern neighbor in from the cold.

As their foreign ministers gathered here Thursday in advance of a weekend summit meeting, Arab leaders sought to formulate a unified position that could appease popular demands to punish Israel but also keep the door open to future Arab-Israeli peacemaking. The Arab League meeting, which opens on Saturday, is expected to affirm Arab support for the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, with the richer oil-producing nations putting aside their active distaste for Arafat and pledging an infusion of money for his administration. But the presidents, princes and kings who lead the 22 member nations of the Arab League are also under exceptional public pressure to produce more at their meeting than their customary words of support for Palestinian self-determination and statehood. Heavy Palestinian casualties during clashes in the West Bank and Gaza Strip this month have inflamed public passions against both Israel and the United States, which is accused of abandoning all pretense of even-handedness in the now-paralyzed peace effort. The tide of anger _ more open and more defiant than any display of grass-roots political activity in at least a decade _ has left many of the Arab leaders in a state of near panic that the demonstrations could turn into more generalized protest against their own governments. One clear outcome of the summit meeting will be an embracing of Arafat, who could direct the outcome through the demands he makes of his fellow Arab leaders on behalf of Palestinians. Faced with his own widespread public impatience with seven years of peace talks, which have produced paltry results in the view of many Palestinians, he will be looking for regional backing for his next moves. ``Arafat going to the summit is like Barak going to Clinton,'' said Tahseen Bashir, a former Egyptian diplomat and aide to Anwar Sadat, the late president. ``When they are cornered, they go to a bigger authority, either to redistribute blame for a failure or to get support and extra money. It means the problem is bigger than they are.'' More extreme elements in the Arab world have already issued calls for a reactivation of an Arab boycott, a freeze on the already sparse Arab diplomatic and economic exchanges with Israel, the use of oil and oil-related contracts as a weapon against Israel's Western allies, and the wholesale transfer of arms to Palestinians to attack Israelis. Yet there are also signs of deep ambivalence toward steps that would erase the tenuous Arab-Israeli thaw of the last decade and push relations back to the days of total nonrecognition. In a television interview on Wednesday, Yemen's president, Ali Abdullah Saleh, urged that nations surrounding Israel open their borders to the flow of weapons and Arab fighters to join in a Palestinian uprising. But when pressed on details, Saleh toned down his demand. ``Yemen wants to help Palestinians defend themselves, not to start a war,'' he said. Similarly, Syria's foreign minister, Farouk al-Sharaa, was quoted by Syrian state radio Thursday as calling for an end to all forms of Arab normalization with Israel. Syria, however, has already declared peace, on its own terms, as its national goal. In the Arab ministers' meeting in Cairo, Sharaa softened the impact of his words, which would in any case affect only a handful of Arab states. ``It is natural, that here we are to speak about peace and not about something else,'' he said. President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt also said the summit meeting was not intended to give up on negotiating a final peace between Arab nations and Israel. In an interview on state television, he responded forcefully when asked if the Arab League would carry out harsh measures against Israel. ``What hard measures?'' he said. ``The logic of war is outdated. Matters can only be solved by negotiation and international pressure.'' But less moderate leaders could still push the summit meeting to a more extreme response, especially if the situation in the Palestinian territories deteriorates in the days leading up to the meeting. One unpredictable factor will be Iraq, which will be represented at a meeting of Arab leaders for the first time in 10 years. Since its invasion of fellow Arab League member Kuwait in 1990, Iraq has not been invited to the group's top-level meetings. It officially condemned Palestinian-Israeli peace talks, and has urged Arab nations to back a full-scale Palestinian war against Israel. But another maverick state, Libya, may not show up at all. The Libyan leader, Col. Muammar Gadhafi, has said he already has seen a draft statement presented to Arab League members in advance of the meeting and found it so feeble that he may not bother to come to Cairo. ``They will make fools of themselves in front of the people because they are so weak,'' he said, referring to his fellow Arab leaders. ``It's as if they are standing naked without a fig leaf. We declare. We condemn. We call for. It's the same old communique.'' If the other Arab leaders on their way to Cairo now find themselves caught in a political vise between public anger and temperate diplomacy, it is partly one of their own making. Many governments have been playing with fire lately, stoking popular rage against Israel by by constantly broadcasting scenes of past Arab-Israeli wars and war songs. State-owned newspapers have excoriated Jews and Judaism, as well as the United States, and have selectively edited the news about Palestinian clashes with Israelis. Anti-American and anti-Israeli protests throughout the region have recently been reinforced by open calls for boycotts of American products and denunciation of European and American companies as Israeli fronts. The drumbeat of hatred and suspicion has gotten so loud in Egypt, for instance, that the British grocery chain Sainsbury's has posted signs in its windows proclaiming that it will do nothing to help Israel ``financially or politically.'' Arab leaders, without exception, also lionized the Hezbollah guerrillas in Lebanon, lauding them as a liberation movement that, through force of arms, drove Israel to abandon its occupation of southern Lebanon in May. Turning off public anger toward Israel, and calling for negotiations over war, may now prove difficult for moderate Arab leaders. ``Nobody will have the courage to stand against the lowest common denominator of public opinion,'' said a former American diplomat to the Middle East, speaking on condition of anonymity. The summit meeting, he added, will provide a road map to future relations between the Arab nations and the United States. ``It will reveal if Arab states like Egypt, Jordan and Saudi Arabia can be a moderating force,'' the former diplomat said. ``In the past they were willing to take the risk of protecting the United States from the more obnoxious elements in Arab politics and to be associated with the United States.''

The inquiry into the attack on the destroyer Cole has led investigators to a mountainous region on the eastern border with Saudi Arabia that has been a stronghold of Islamic groups returning from the war against Soviet forces in Afghanistan, American and Yemeni officials said on Thursday. As the investigation gathered pace on Thursday, the Navy announced it had recovered the bodies of the last four sailors listed as missing after the suicide bombing attack, which occurred last Thursday and killed 17 sailors and wounded 39 others. Divers with metal-cutters found the bodies deep inside the ship, an area so devastated that Louis J. Freeh, the director of the FBI, described the scene after a visit as ``absolutely catastrophic damage.'' Yemeni officials also said they had searched a house near the harbor that they have tentatively identified as the place where the bomb was assembled. The search yielded at least one document that originated in Hadhramaut, a region about 500 miles northeast of Aden along the border with Saudi Arabia. The area is the ancestral home of the family of Osama bin Laden, the exiled Saudi financier who is the FBI's most-wanted terrorist suspect because, the bureau says, he directed the bombing of the American embassies in East Africa in 1998. Although the document, a driver's license, was made out to a false name, the Yemeni officials said, they had begun intensive inquiries in the region. But they did not say the evidence had led them to conclude that bin Laden, who is in hiding in Afghanistan, is a suspect. Freeh and other American officials said it was still too early to speculate about who might have ordered or carried out the attack, or on possible motives. Freeh's one-day visit here, to consult with investigators and with President Ali Abdullah Saleh, reflected the importance attached by Washington to leads developed by the Yemenis. Yemeni officials have said a 12-year-old boy provided a crucial lead when he told the police that he had been approached by a bearded Arab man with glasses who approached him as he played beside the bay last Thursday morning, about the time the Cole entered the harbor. The boy's account, the Yemenis said, was that the stranger gave him a few coins to watch a car and boat trailer. Then the man unloaded the boat, launched it and disappeared, the boy said. Yemeni officials said the car was registered to a woman from Somalia, across the Gulf of Aden from Yemen. At a news conference, Freeh praised the ``fine investigative work'' by the Yemenis in identifying two safe houses a few miles across the bay from where the Cole was attacked, as well as the car, the trailer and the documents linking two men who lived at one house to Hadhramaut. The Yemenis displayed ``very, very good police work,'' he added. Saleh said in a television interview Wednesday that one of the houses had been used to prepare what he and Freeh, separately, described as ``the explosive device.'' American officials said the phrase would cover a large bomb of about a third of a ton of TNT, the kind American investigators originally believed to have been used in the attack, as well as something more sophisticated, like a ``shaped charge'' _ a torpedo or a missile. In the week since the attack, more detailed accounts have described much greater damage to the destroyer than earlier Navy reports suggested. Freeh appeared shocked by the damage he saw when a Navy launch took him up to the gaping hole on the Cole, which Navy officials describe as being wide enough for two city buses to pass through abreast. Witnesses _ Yemenis on the waterfront and sailors abroad the Cole _ have said a small boat moving among other craft servicing the Cole rammed the ship's port side and exploded in a ball of flame. Freeh said photographs did not adequately convey the destruction. The decks separating mess halls and engineering spaces, where most of the sailors died, collapsed in the blast, leaving ``a tangled mess of metal and wire,'' he said. Saleh gave a similar account. The Yemeni leader, a former army general, said his initial insistence that the explosion must have resulted from an accident aboard the Cole was based on having gone out to look closely at the Cole and wondering ``how a small boat that is about the size of a desk could possibly cause this much damage.'' The president said he had been told by ``American technicians'' that the damage from the explosion had reached within seven feet of the ship's arsenal, where cruise missiles were stored.

A fire ripped through a nightclub in central Mexico City on Friday, killing several people and snarling morning traffic. The government's Notimex news agency reported that at least seven people had died at the Lobohombo nightclub. The Televisa television network said police reported 17 dead. Notimex said most of those killed were believed to be workers at the club. Notimex said the fire broke out shortly after 5 a.m. The cause was not immediately known. The blaze was apparently extinguished before dawn. Police and firefighters blocked off traffic on the busy Insurgentes avenue in both directions in front of the nightclub, which is located near the intersection with another major thoroughfare, the Paseo de la Reforma.

For decades, North Korea seemed to relish confrontation with the United States at the negotiating table, a strategy that U.S. officials viewed as brinkmanship: ratchet up the tension to win concessions. These days, threats, insults and walkouts have faded as North Korean negotiating tools. So Washington's Cold War-era foe is sure to lavish pomp and protocol on Secretary of State Madeleine Albright on a visit to North Korea next week. Albright, who leaves for Pyongyang on Sunday, will likely be treated to orderly crowds of well-wishers, theater performances and toasts and handshakes with North Korean leader Kim Jong Il. These images of rapprochement could lead to a visit by President Clinton next month. But there will also be blunt talk of the communist North's missile program and its desire to get off a U.S. list of terrorism-sponsoring nations _ issues that have stalled hopes for permanent peace on the Korean peninsula since it was devastated by war 50 years ago. Both sides declared their intent to ``formally end the Korean War'' by resolving these quandaries in a joint statement that was released in Washington during a trip this month by Gen. Jo Myong Rok, a top aide to Kim Jong Il. The two sides might wait before tackling other complex topics such as troop reductions and weapons withdrawals from the Demilitarized Zone, a buffer zone separating the two Koreas. ``These are very tough. It's going to take a while to work out. Now the North is saying it's time to start,'' said Leon Sigal, author of the book ``Disarming Strangers: Nuclear Diplomacy with North Korea.'' The Albright visit is part of a coordinated strategy involving Washington and its allies, South Korea and Japan, to end the North's isolation and remove the threat of war in one of the world's most volatile regions. South Korean President Kim Dae-jung and Kim Jong Il set the stage for reconciliation by pledging at a summit in June to pursue reunification. Kim Dae-jung won the Nobel Peace Prize last week for his peace efforts. Meanwhile, Japan plans talks with North Korea in Beijing on Oct. 30 and 31 following two rounds held earlier this year. Europe is also responding to North Korea's attempts to shed its image as a pariah state and attract international aid to revive its economy and stave off food shortages. Britain and Germany plan to open diplomatic relations soon. Albright's meetings next Monday and Tuesday in Pyongyang may serve as an opportunity for the North to publicly clarify its stand on the 37,000 U.S. soldiers based in South Korea. Kim Dae-jung has said that Kim Jong Il acknowledged at their summit that the U.S. military could play a role in Korea as guarantors of regional security even after reunification. There are fears in South Korea that the removal of U.S. forces could destabilize the balance of power in Northeast Asia by emboldening Japan and China. A deal appears close on removing North Korea from Washington's terrorism list, which bars all but humanitarian aid to the Pyongyang government and forbids other economic benefits. This month, Pyongyang met a U.S. condition for getting off the list by issuing a joint statement with Washington renouncing all forms of terrorism. North Korea was put on the list because of involvement in the bombing of a South Korean airliner near Burma, now Myanmar, in 1987, that killed all 115 people on board. North Korea, which rattled the region by test-firing a rocket over Japan in 1998, has offered to drop its long-range missile program in return for billions of dollars in compensation. U.S. officials have refused the offer, but some experts speculate that Pyongyang might settle for aid and investment rather than a cash payoff. The fruits of the hard bargaining might only be announced during a possible Clinton trip to Pyongyang. ``Albright may try to draw attention to Clinton's visit by announcing one or two small agreements such as opening liaison offices,'' said Seo Joo-seok, an analyst at the state-run Korea Institute for Defense Analysis.

the attack on the "uss cole" in yemen is being reassessed tonight. abc's barry serafin is in our washington bureau. i gather the thing that the navy is looking at is the actual timing. we were led to believe that the attack occurred just as the "uss cole" was tying up. not true, apparently? not true, according to new information now released by the navy, peter. the navy now says the ship was actually moored nearly two hours before the explosion took place. it was, in fact, in the process of being refueled at the time of the blast. the original scenario was the theory was that rtj c world news/peter jennings abc % rtj ! had slipped in as part of the moorin operation. that was not true. the ship was tied up, it was in a very vulnerable position as it was being refueled. however, the navy now says that hands-on deck who were manning machine guns, as part of an alert, still believed they had seen this small boat as part of the mooring operation, and that is apparently why they were not suspicious. let me understand the last point again. if it was not part of the mooring operation, does it mean it was lost in a cluster of boats or operating clear to sea? this was a small boat that at that point, peter, should not have been approaching this ship, but apparently the hands on deck who were supposed to be maintaining security, believed this was a small boat they had seen earlier as part of the mooring operation, and therefore did not view it as a suspicious boat. thanks very much. it often happens in a case like this, as time goes on, the assessment changes. today, the bodies of the last four sailors recovered from the "cole" were sent home to the united states. 17 sailors were killed in the blast. at arlington national cemetery, the first of the funerals. cheron gunn from rex, georgia was buried next to his ship mate richard costello of morrisville, pennsylvania.

At least 20 people died on Friday when a fire destroyed a huge nightclub in the heart of Mexico City that had been repeatedly cited for safety violations, officials said. The deaths set off an outcry against the ingrained public corruption that may have contributed to the deaths. A city official, Dolores Padierna, who represents the downtown district where the two-story, 32,000-square-foot Lobohombo nightclub stood, said 20 people were killed and at least 39 injured after a fire broke out in the club about 5 a.m. She and other officials said the club was owned by businessmen suspected of ties to organized crime. They said the Lobohombo had been ordered closed by the authorities because of a tangle of safety and security issues. But it stayed open after the owners blocked the orders with 11 appeals and injunctions against the city. Questions about the owners, including whether they had paid off judges to hand down those injunctions, arose quickly after the flames died down at dawn. Padierna called the deaths ``the result of the impunity by which underworld and mafia leaders ignore the safety standards set by the city and live under protection in exchange for money.'' Mayor Rosario Robles said the club's principal owner, whom she identified as Alejandro Iglesias Rebollo, would be charged with negligent homicide. And she said judges had placed ``a straitjacket on officials looking for ways to close down criminal enterprises.'' The Lobohombo, on its mirrored face, was a glittery club for live music and dancing, popular among young middle-class patrons, with salsa and merengue bands and a $25 cover charge. But behind the facade, officials said, were gas and electric systems that could not meet codes. They said the Lobohombo had no posted emergency exits and violated many other safety standards. The director of Mexico City's civil protection agency, Luis Wintergerts, said the safety violations were ``ignored by the judge that granted the disco an operating license.'' Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who will succeed Robles as mayor on Dec. 1, said he would ask Mexico's Supreme Court to investigate and publicly denounce judges who collude with businessmen over the granting of business licenses.

I'm Dave Deforest, VOA News. A cease-fire between Israelis and Palestinians failed on Friday as at least nine more Palestinians were killed in clashes between Palestinian stone throwers and Israeli troops. Prime Minister Ehud Barak said, Friday, Israel will take a time out to reassess the peace process if the violence continues. President Clinton spoke by telephone with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and the White House says, Mr. Arafat promised to do everything possible to restore calm. United Nation's Secretary General Kofi Annan appealed Friday for calming words as the UN General assembly began a second emergency session on the violence in the Middle East. VOA correspondent Breck Ardery reports from the United Nations. Mr. Annan delivered a formal report on his visit to the Mid East and the agreement to end the violence that was reached at Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt. He said it is only natural that the events of the last few weeks should arouse strong feelings. However, he cautioned members of the General Assembly not to further inflame passions. Words can inflame or soothe and everyone needs a restoration of calm and quiet so as to create the best possible atmosphere for the resumption of peace talks. The General Assembly is expected to vote on a strongly worded resolution sponsored by Arab nations that would condemn Israel for the use of excessive force against Palestinian civilians. The United States says such a resolution is one-sided and inflammatory and plans to oppose it. Breck Ardery, VOA News at the United Nations. Arab leaders opened an emergency summit on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict today. The Cairo meeting is the first Arab League summit meeting in four years. At least 15 heads of state are have called for all ties to be severed between Arab countries and Israel, while others have urged a freeze or reduction of cooperation and an economic boycott of Israel. Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat will attend the meeting.

From his distant view in downtown Norfolk, Va., Dave Rosenfield, the general manager of the Norfolk Tides, said the Subway Series seemed like a page out of some subterranean nightmare. He has been following the drama, reading the dueling headlines laden with talk of ``Civil War'' and ``battles.'' He has watched with the mixed feeling of someone with one foot in the baseball world of metaphors and similes, and the other foot in the world of the U.S. Navy, where real people sometimes die defending the right of a country to enjoy the national pastime. From Rosenfield's baseball standpoint, the Series is satisfying. Bobby Valentine managed at Norfolk in 1994 and 1996. Benny Agbayani played at Norfolk from 1996 to 1999. Agbayani and his wife were married at home plate at the Tides' Harbor Park before the International League's 1998 All-Star Game. ``Benny was a guy who was passed over and played hard enough that he forced somebody to look at him,'' Rosenfield said. Jay Payton played at Norfolk in 1995, 1996, 1998 and 1999. ``Here's a guy who spent his whole career injured until this year,'' Rosenfield said. ``This is the first year that he's ever remained healthy.'' Bobby J. Jones pitched the first game in the Tides' new stadium in 1993. This year, the Tides' brief, shining star was Timo Perez, who came out of nowhere. ``When they sent him up to us in June,'' Rosenfield said, ``they took Jason Tyner to the majors and said, `We're going to send you Perez.' I said, `You're going to do what? Who?' Nobody knew him at all.'' But on other fronts, the impending Subway Series has been a thorn in Rosenfield's side and a disappointment. The ticket crush has been disheartening. Rosenfield was allotted 20 tickets for each of the three games at Shea Stadium. He has no tickets for Yankee Stadium. ``If I had 100 tickets, I couldn't take care of what I've got,'' he said. ``We have our major sponsors, our owners, our investors, our major advertisers. I've had a list going since July. ``It's been terrible. It's taken some of the fun out of the anticipation of the Series for me.'' But what really took the joy out of the Series was the recent bombing attack against the Navy destroyer Cole, which took the lives of 17 crew members. The Tides' office is only 20 minutes south of the Norfolk Naval Station, where the Cole is based. The Tides' organization has developed a close relationship with the Navy. ``Over the course of each season, we have a number of sailors who want to re-enlist on the field,'' Rosenfield said. Two years ago, the Tides were the hosts of the International League All-Star Game and tossed a pregame party on the USS Enterprise. The team has special prices for active members of the military and does a number of group nights linked to the naval base. On May 15, the Cole had such a night at Harbor Park. Rosenfield said he was devastated by news of the attack. ``I'm terribly disturbed,'' he said. ``It's kind of an eerie feeling when you read about any sort of a naval disaster, but particularly with a ship that's home-ported here _ the feeling that you probably met some of those guys. ``It brings the world situation closer than you want it to be. You'd rather have things detached, but when something like that happens, it really just brings it home.'' Rosenfield, who turned 69 last spring, can remember when the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor. ``I don't think any of us in the United States felt the same thing about war that the people, say, in Britain did,'' Rosenfield said. ``I think it was brought home to us if we had relatives that were killed or injured or captured, but the fact is that the war really never came to our street. I think when you become involved in a situation like we were in here, with the Cole and the Navy, you feel like it's on your block.'' He wondered if Major League Baseball would do something to honor the sailors who lost their lives and the sailors who survived. Perhaps Major League Baseball could invite the sailors to New York to attend a game. ``I think that would give a marvelous feeling to the whole Series,'' Rosenfield said. Later in the day, Commissioner Bud Selig said the idea had been tossed around in a meeting, but had not gone much further. The more he thought of it, the more he said he realized that a tribute during baseball's greatest drama would be fitting. By the end of the day, Selig had discussed the matter with Rear Admiral Jay Foley, commander of the Naval Surface Force, U.S. Atlantic Fleet. They agreed to have some of the sailors honored during Game 4 on Wednesday at Shea Stadium. Rosenfield said it was the best news he had received in weeks. ``We're going to do something big,'' Selig said. ``We're going to bring as many as we can; we will do something that honors each one of them. ``But you know what's so amazing?'' he added. ``They were flattered that we would even think about them. That's what's so stunning. After what I've put up with all day, with ticket requests from people. No, they will be more than appropriately honored, although as I said to the admiral, we're the ones who are honored. ``You've got to put life in its perspective. This is a baseball game. I used to tell myself that when the Brewers would blow a game and I'd think the world was coming to an end. And all of a sudden I'd realize you have to go through an evolution of really understanding what's important in life and what isn't. This is the least we can do, and it's hardly enough, and it's nothing compared to what they've done.'' There were complaints that the New York-New York World Series was too self-absorbed. With survivors from the Cole coming to the city on Wednesday, the Subway Series is what New York is at its core: a place and event the entire nation can embrace.

The Navy has altered its account of events leading to the bombing of the USS Cole in Yemen last week. The changes raise new questions about how the attackers foiled Navy security. The Navy said Friday the explosion occurred nearly two hours after the Cole was moored to a fuel dock in Aden harbor, not during the mooring operation, as it said before. That means the boat believed to have detonated the explosives did not use a flotilla of harbor craft as cover, as the Navy said previously. It is now less clear than before how the attacking boat could have approached the Cole without raising suspicion. The Oct. 12 attack killed 17 U.S. sailors and injured 39. The last four bodies recovered from the Cole on Thursday were to be flown back to the United States from Bahrain over the weekend. The remains of eight other Cole victims were returned to Dover Air Force Base, Del., on Friday in preparation for burial. The first set of five remains were sent home last week. In a brief statement Friday, the Navy's Office of Information said earlier statements now known to be erroneous were based on initial reports from the ship that were either wrong or were misunderstood by Pentagon officials. The Navy said it now has obtained additional information from the Cole's records that change at least three points of fact in the official timeline. _The explosion occurred at 11:18 a.m. local time (4:18 a.m. EDT), or about an hour earlier than originally reported. _Refueling began at 10:30 a.m. and was ongoing at the time of the attack. Before, the Navy had said refueling had not yet begun. _The Cole was completely tied up at the fueling dock in Aden harbor at 9:30 a.m., nearly two hours before the attack. The Navy previously had said the mooring operation was completed just minutes before. This last point is of particular significance to investigators because it would seem to undercut the theory previously advanced by Navy officials that the small boat seen sidling up to the Cole at the time of the explosion used the mooring operation _ involving several harbor work boats _ as a means of masking its attack. Navy officials had said the attacking boat did not raise suspicions because it appeared to be part of the mooring operation, in which small harbor boats take the ship's lines to secure it to the floating dock. The Navy has said the Cole and its crew were at the second-highest level of alert observed in the Fifth Fleet, of which the Cole was a part at that time. Crew members would have been assigned to watch through binoculars for boats approaching the Cole, and others keeping watch would have been armed with weapons. Cmdr. Greg Smith, a Navy spokesman at the Pentagon, said the revised timeline was established this week by using more precise information from the Cole's records, information collected in response to an inquiry by the Navy Times newspaper, a nongovernment publication. The newspaper said an unidentified source associated with the port of Aden told it the Navy's original timeline was incorrect. On the day of the attack, Adm. Vern Clark, the chief of naval operations, told a Pentagon news conference the explosion happened at 12:15 p.m. local time, that the Cole had just finished being tied up at the fuel dock and that the refueling had not yet begun. He also said this information was based on initial reports from the scene and that he could not be sure it was ''100 percent accurate.'' Pentagon and State Department officials canceled planned appearances Friday before a closed-door session of the Senate Armed Services Committee. The committee heard Thursday from retired Marine Corps Gen. Anthony Zinni, who said he made the decision to refuel at Aden, largely because there was no good alternative. The administration told the panel Friday that it needed more time to prepare for the hearing, said committee chairman Sen. John Warner, R-Va. ___ On the Net: Navy: http://www.navy.mil

The Palestinian ``problem'' has driven politics and policy in the Arab world for nearly as long as there have been independent Arab states. More than a preoccupation, it has had the force to undermine rulers, incite revolutions, circumscribe development and define patriotism. That Palestine, for so many decades, has produced such resounding concussions in the region is a sign of genuine Arab frustration that so many Palestinians remain refugees and that their desire for statehood remains unfulfilled. But its power has another dimension. Activism on behalf of Palestinians is just about the only form of political engagement that the authoritarian Arab governments have permitted their citizens. It has the advantage, for these regimes, of being directed outward, against a usually distant enemy. But the leaders' quandary is that they know, from history, that political disaffection is a constantly expanding force and can turn inward as well. The centrality of the Palestinian problem in the Middle East was underlined this weekend, as Arab leaders gathered for one of their increasingly rare summit meetings under the umbrella of the Arab League in Cairo. The meeting was called to figure out a united response to the spiraling violence between Israeli troops and Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza, violence that prominent figures on both sides believe has effectively derailed the peace process as it has existed over the last seven years. Faced with public horror at the mounting Palestinian casualties and sympathy for what is now being called the Al Aksa intifada, or uprising, the normally fractious Arab leaders have to decide whether a continued investment in peace-making is worth the risk to their own credibility. The widespread demonstrations that erupted in most Arab nations in the past three weeks, in response to the deaths of more than 100 Palestinians in clashes with Israeli troops, exposed the vise that most Arab leaders have created for themselves. They allowed _ even encouraged _ public protests over the fate of Palestinians. But then the leaders worried: with no format for real public debate or participation in national decision-making, people who are permitted to rally around one cause could soon grab the opportunity of the street to express all their pent-up grievances. ``They feel truly threatened,'' said a former American diplomat, referring to Arab leaders. ``When was the last time you saw a demonstration in Saudi Arabia? This is serious stuff because what happens in this sort of situation is that demonstrators start to express their rage against the perpetrators and end by charging their own governments with appeasement.'' There is plenty to be angry about in the state of Arab affairs. Much of the Middle East depends on Western handouts, and budgets are strained keeping up with the appetite for new weaponry and the pressure from Europe and the United States to buy more and more arms. Meanwhile, poverty is rampant. The gap between the rich (and politically connected) and the poor is growing. In nations like Egypt and Jordan, which have signed peace accords with Israel, there is widespread frustration that the general public has not enjoyed the prosperity that peace and the concomitant alliance with the United States were supposed to bring. The furious rounds of consultations that preceded this weekend's Arab League summit demonstrated how exposed many Arab leaders feel, now that the public has been given a green light to express itself. So have the government-sponsored fund-raising drives for Palestinians, the government calls to donate blood and the pledges from well-connected Arab businessmen to send money to the Palestinian Authority and its hospitals. All are meant to make sure that public restiveness remains channeled toward the immediate external crisis involving the Palestinians and the Israelis. Not all the demonstrations were spontaneous. In Iraq, they were stage-managed by the dictatorship of President Saddam Hussein. In Jordan, the restive Islamic fundamentalist opposition took charge and provided the fiery preachers to inflame the protesters. But in other countries, notably Egypt, some of the street rallies and marches seemed to take the government by surprise because of their size and tenor. In Syria, demonstrations appeared to have been government-sanctioned, but an attack by a crowd on the United States Embassy did not. An anti-Israeli protest in the south of Saudi Arabia, according to some news reports that could not be confirmed, turned bloody when police fired on the crowd. Those who have been agitating for wholesale revolution took heart. ``We pray to God to prolong the intifada, and turn it into the trigger that will stir the Arab street to vent its accumulated frustrations, because there is more than one Milosevic in the Arab world,'' wrote Abd al-Barai al Atwan in the London-based newspaper al-Quds al-Arabi, a voice for Arab opposition movements. In countries where there are parliaments, independent media outlets, political parties, trade unions and other institutions of a civil society, government policies can be discussed, without fear that the government will be overthrown. But, almost without exception, Arab nations do not have such bodies. And when they do, the social and political organizations live in fear of capricious government crackdowns. Egypt, for instance, has an elected parliament. The first round of voting for a new one began last week. But one party is enshrined in the constitution as the state political organ and it has permitted only a handful of others to participate. Jordan, Morocco, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia are monarchies. There, as in Egypt and the North African states, it is illegal to ``insult'' the rulers or publish anything that damages the national interest. Those laws can be used to silence journalists, human rights groups, union leaders and opposition candidates. Syria and Iraq are one-party states led by all-powerful rulers, where any hint of criticism of the government or government policy is punished severely. Even when there is a reform-minded leader _ something Syria's new president, Bashar al-Assad, has claimed to be _ he is weighed down by the entrenched Old Guard. Still, the Arab leaders may have nothing to worry about if they stay just ahead of the public anger and keep it focused on something none of them can do anything much about, that is, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Public agitation could well spend itself. Overt outrage over Israel, the United States or unresponsive Arab leaders has not had the momentum to topple a regime in many years. Not only are there few mechanisms to translate political feelings into political action, but the inclination to throw everything out and start anew may be gone. ``The population is not politicized,'' said Bassma Kodmani, a political analyst who works for the Ford Foundation in Cairo. ``If there is discontent, there is spontaneous expression of that discontent, but it doesn't transform into a political strategy.'' Other Arab commentators have dared to hope that the rulers may be worried enough to think of the future and allow their people an unfettered political voice. ``The Arab leaders have a right to be told frankly and sincerely that the Al Aksa intifada and the barbaric Israeli aggression unleashed to crush it was, and will remain, a turning point,'' wrote Saleheddin Hafez, managing editor of Al Ahram, a government-controlled newspaper in Egypt. ``It is a turning point not just for the peace process but also for the future of the Arab countries, specifically in terms of formulating the relationship between rulers and ruled.''

Led by masked gunmen, tens of thousands of Palestinians marched Saturday behind the flag-draped bodies of four members of Yasser Arafat's Fatah movement killed in a firefight with Israeli troops a day earlier. In new clashes Saturday in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, several Palestinians were injured by Israeli fire, including one man who was in critical condition with a head wound. In Nablus, the funeral procession slowly wound its way through the streets. A lead truck carried masked militiamen hoisting their assault rifles. Many mourners carried flags of Arab countries, in an appeal for support from the Arab summit in Cairo. ``Oh Arabs, pay attention, the Palestinians are getting killed,'' the crowd chanted. Opening the summit Saturday, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak blamed Israel for bringing the peace process to a standstill by ``terrorizing innocent civilians and killing defenseless children,'' but said Arabs would not abandon the path of negotiation. Arafat said that despite ``the worst kinds of mass killings, shelling in addition to severe siege ... our choice is the choice of permanent, just and comprehensive peace.'' However, Amar Hassan, 28, a Fatah supporter in Nablus, said confrontation, not peace talks, will bring Palestinian independence. ``We should stop throwing stones,'' said Hassan. ``We should learn how to shoot, how to plant explosives near the roads.'' A stone-throwing clash on the main street of Hebron in the West Bank turned into an exchange of gunfire, witnesses said. In a rare display of hostility aimed at moderate Arab leaders, Palestinian marchers at a Hebron funeral burned photos of Mubarak, Jordan's King Abdullah, Morocco's King Mohammed and Saudi Arabia's King Fahd. Jordan and Egypt have diplomatic relations with Israel, while Morocco and Saudi Arabia have close ties with the United States, Israel's leading ally. Rock-throwing confrontations also erupted near the Erez crossing between the Gaza Strip and Israel, and near the Gaza town of Khan Yunis. Several Palestinians were injured, including one in Gaza who was in critical condition. In Friday's fighting, nine Palestinians were killed and 103 injured, the deadliest day in two weeks. Three weeks of fighting have left 113 people dead, most of them Palestinians. The fiercest battle erupted Friday south of Nablus, where Fatah militiamen opened fire on Israeli troops just moments after an Israeli deadline for a U.S.-brokered truce expired. In an intense 10-minute exchange of fire, four Palestinians were killed and 27 wounded. In response to the violence, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak said he would call an open-ended ``time-out'' after the Arab summit to rethink Israeli policy concerning the peace talks. Until now, a peace agreement with the Palestinians had been Barak's top priority. ``Time-out is not a slogan. This is what is needed,'' Barak said. ``We cannot go on with the peace process as if nothing has happened.'' After the Arab summit, the Israeli government may also revise orders to Israeli troops on how to handle Palestinian riots and complete its assessment on ``unilateral separation'' from the Palestinians, Barak said. In such a scenario, Israel would unilaterally draw a fortified border with the Palestinians without waiting for a peace agreement. Barak has been courting Israel's hawkish opposition leader, Ariel Sharon, who has said he would not join an emergency coalition _ and thus save Barak from early elections _ unless Israel walked away from the peace talks. Barak and Sharon met Friday, shortly after the truce collapsed. Israeli Cabinet minister Matan Vilnai said Saturday a time-out was necessary, but that Israel hoped to return to negotiations. ``At the moment, we lack a partner,'' Vilnai told Israel radio. ``I hope this is temporary. I'm not saying (our partner) won't be Arafat in the future. He is still the Palestinian leader. But at the moment, it seems that Arafat thinks he can get by force what he can't get through negotiations.'' Meanwhile, the U.N. General Assembly voted overwhelmingly Friday to condemn the ``excessive use of force'' by Israeli troops. The United States, Israel and four other countries voted against the nonbinding resolution. Israel's Foreign Ministry condemned the action, saying the vote ignored the mob killing of two Israeli soldier and the desecration of Jewish holy sites. The Israelis also criticized the Palestinian Authority for not doing more to restrain militiamen who ``use live fire everywhere, including against Israeli citizens, and sends women and children to clash with us.''

Israeli troops and Palestinians battled at several flashpoints in the West Bank and Gaza Strip on Saturday, leaving two dead, while tens of thousands of Palestinians marched behind the flag-draped bodies of four activists killed a day earlier. Saturday's confrontations also resulted in more than 50 Palestinian injuries, and there were no signs that the recent fighting was abating. More than three weeks of battles have left 115 dead, almost all of them Palestinian. In Nablus, the massive funeral procession slowly wound its way through the streets. A lead truck carried masked militiamen hoisting their assault rifles. Many mourners carried flags of Arab countries, in an appeal for support from an Arab summit in Cairo, Egypt. ``Oh Arabs, pay attention, the Palestinians are getting killed,'' the crowd chanted.

A stone-throwing confrontation on the main street of Hebron in the West Bank turned into an exchange of gunfire, witnesses said. A taxi driver away from the site of the clash was killed when he was hit in the head by a bullet, doctors said. In a rare display of hostility aimed at moderate Arab leaders, Palestinian marchers at a Hebron funeral burned photos of Mubarak, Jordan's King Abdullah II, Morocco's King Mohammed VI and Saudi Arabia's King Fahd. Those Arab leaders all back Palestinian aspirations, though Jordan and Egypt also have diplomatic relations with Israel, while Morocco and Saudi Arabia have close ties with the United States, Israel's leading ally. In the Gaza Strip, a 16-year-old Palestinian boy was shot and killed in a confrontation near the town of Khan Yunis, and a rock-throwing clash broke out near the Erez crossing with Israel. More than 50 Palestinians were injured, according to Dr. Mouauia Hassina at the Shifa Hospital. In Friday's fighting, nine Palestinians were killed and 103 injured, the deadliest day in two weeks.

At an Arab summit held amid outrage at violence that has killed scores of Palestinians, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak blamed Israel on Saturday for bringing the peace process to a standstill, but said Arabs would not abandon the path of negotiations. Mubarak opened the summit a day after Israel declared it was putting the peace process on hold and U.S. efforts to bring calm were shattered by gunbattles in the West Bank. With Israel watching carefully, leaders who gathered here for the first time in four years are trying to strike a balance between keeping the peace process alive and assuaging an angry Arab public demanding strong measures against the Jewish state. Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat said his people were facing ``the worst kinds of mass killings, shelling in addition to severe siege.'' Still, he said, ``Our choice is the choice of permanent, just and comprehensive peace.'' ``Our aim is to liberate our land, set up our independent state ... with Jerusalem as its capital and the return of refugees,'' Arafat said, speaking after Mubarak and after a moment of silence in commemoration of Palestinian dead. A grave-looking Mubarak called on Israel to prove that it, too, wanted peace amid the clashes that have killed more than 100 people, mostly Palestinians. Mubarak warned that Israel was showing ``a trend ... toward provocation'' by closing off the Palestinian territories, ``terrorizing innocent civilians and killing defenseless children and letting loose extremists settlers armed with guns.'' ``We insist on guarantees that this not be repeated under any circumstances,'' he said. It was one of the most important speeches of Mubarak's career, following the collapse of a cease-fire he and President Clinton helped broker this week at Egypt's Sharm el-Sheik resort. On Friday, Palestinian militiamen fired on Israeli soldiers, drawing massive return fire. Nine Palestinians were killed and 103 wounded in one of the worst days of violence in the West Bank since fighting erupted there three weeks ago. Clashes continued Saturday at flashpoints in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, leaving two Palestinians dead and more than 50 injured. ``These acts prove that Israel doesn't want peace,'' Palestinian Foreign Minister Farouk Kaddoumi had said as he headed into the Arab summit, which drew 15 heads of state from among the Arab League's 22 members. Egypt in 1979 became the first Arab country to sign a peace treaty with Israel. It has since then tried to mediate in efforts for peace deals between the Jewish state and Syria and the Palestinians. But in the wake of the violence, Arab leaders are under great pressure to justify even the lowest level of contacts with Israel. Drafts of the summit's final declaration, reports say, call for Arab countries with trade offices in Tel Aviv to recall their representatives and for Egypt and Jordan, the only countries with diplomatic relations, to halt already faltering steps to encourage business and cultural exchanges. ``All kinds of cooperation with Israel should be stopped and the boycott should be reactivated,'' Syrian President Bashar Assad said, repeating the hard-line stance of his late father, whom he succeeded earlier this year. On the streets, many Arabs are calling for much more. ``The only way to liberate Jerusalem is through holy war,'' crowds chanted in San'a, Yemen during an anti-summit, anti-Israel and anti-American protest that drew thousands on Saturday. At the funeral Saturday of four of the Palestinians killed the previous day, many of the thousands of mourners in the West Bank town of Nablus carried flags of Arab countries, in an appeal for support from the summit. ``Oh Arabs, pay attention, the Palestinians are getting killed,'' the crowd chanted. ``If (the summit) will not call for holy war against the Jews, it has failed,'' said Jawad Mubarak, an Amman, Jordan, bookstore clerk. In demonstrations across the region, Arab initially directed their anger at Israel, their emotions fueled by satellite television images of young Palestinian protesters gunned down by the Israeli army. Recently, the anger has also been directed at Arab governments seen as too soft on Israel. Mubarak acknowledged that ``we are all angry'' but warned against ``surrendering to our emotions.'' ``We must as people who have rights continue on the long road toward our legitimate rights and let no passing provocation sway us from it, because right in the end is what triumphs,'' he said. Other Arab leaders called for strong action against Israel. Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, in a speech read by his deputy Izzat Ibrahim, called Saturday for liberating Palestinians from Israel ``through holy war.'' Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi even publicly ridiculed what he predicted would be an ineffectual outcome from a divided summit. It takes a crisis to bring Arab leaders together, and crises inevitably reveal the hollowness of Arab pledges to take unified stances. The last Arab League summit in 1996 struggled to forge a united stand on peace with Israel. The previous summit, in 1990, saw the Arabs split over one league member's invasion of another _ Iraq's move into Kuwait. Since then, Kuwait and other Gulf states have refused to sit down with Iraq, derailing attempts to hold more regular summits. Mubarak, who has repeatedly called for healing rifts within the Arab League, met early Saturday with the head of the Iraqi delegation. Iraqi President Saddam Hussein sent a deputy to Cairo. Kuwait's deputy prime minister, Sheik Sabah al Ahmed al Sabah, attended.

Israeli troops and Palestinians battled at several flashpoints in the West Bank and Gaza Strip on Saturday, leaving two dead, while tens of thousands of Palestinians marched behind the flag-draped bodies of four activists killed a day earlier. Saturday's confrontations also resulted in more than 50 Palestinian injuries, and there were no signs that the recent fighting was abating. More than three weeks of battles have left 115 dead, almost all of them Palestinian. In Nablus, the massive funeral procession slowly wound its way through the streets. A lead truck carried masked militiamen hoisting their assault rifles. Many mourners carried flags of Arab countries, in an appeal for support from an Arab summit in Cairo, Egypt. ``Oh Arabs, pay attention, the Palestinians are getting killed,'' the crowd chanted. Opening the summit, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak blamed Israel for bringing the peace process to a standstill by ``terrorizing innocent civilians and killing defenseless children,'' but said Arabs would not abandon the path of negotiation. Arafat said that despite ``the worst kinds of mass killings, shelling in addition to severe siege ... our choice is the choice of permanent, just and comprehensive peace.'' However, Amar Hassan, 28, a Fatah supporter in Nablus, said confrontation, not peace talks, will bring Palestinian independence. ``We should stop throwing stones,'' said Hassan. ``We should learn how to shoot, how to plant explosives near the roads.'' A stone-throwing confrontation on the main street of Hebron in the West Bank turned into an exchange of gunfire, witnesses said. A taxi driver away from the site of the clash was killed when he was hit in the head by a bullet, doctors said. In a rare display of hostility aimed at moderate Arab leaders, Palestinian marchers at a Hebron funeral burned photos of Mubarak, Jordan's King Abdullah II, Morocco's King Mohammed VI and Saudi Arabia's King Fahd. Those Arab leaders all back Palestinian aspirations, though Jordan and Egypt also have diplomatic relations with Israel, while Morocco and Saudi Arabia have close ties with the United States, Israel's leading ally. In the Gaza Strip, a 16-year-old Palestinian boy was shot and killed in a confrontation near the town of Khan Yunis, and a rock-throwing clash broke out near the Erez crossing with Israel. More than 50 Palestinians were injured, according to Dr. Mouauia Hassina at the Shifa Hospital. In Friday's fighting, nine Palestinians were killed and 103 injured, the deadliest day in two weeks. The fiercest battle erupted Friday south of Nablus, where Fatah militiamen opened fire on Israeli troops just moments after an Israeli deadline for a U.S.-brokered truce expired. In an intense 10-minute exchange of fire, four Palestinians were killed and 27 wounded. In response to the violence, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak said he would call an open-ended ``time-out'' after the Arab summit to rethink Israeli policy concerning the peace talks. Until now, a peace agreement with the Palestinians had been Barak's top priority. ``Time-out is not a slogan. This is what is needed,'' Barak said. ``We cannot go on with the peace process as if nothing has happened.'' After the Arab summit, the Israeli government may also revise orders to Israeli troops on how to handle Palestinian riots and complete its assessment on ``unilateral separation'' from the Palestinians, Barak said. In such a scenario, Israel would unilaterally draw a fortified border with the Palestinians without waiting for a peace agreement. Israeli Cabinet minister Matan Vilnai said Saturday a time-out was necessary, but that Israel hoped to return to negotiations. ``At the moment, we lack a partner,'' Vilnai told Israel radio. ``I hope this is temporary. I'm not saying (our partner) won't be Arafat in the future. He is still the Palestinian leader. But at the moment, it seems that Arafat thinks he can get by force what he can't get through negotiations.'' Meanwhile, the U.N. General Assembly voted overwhelmingly Friday to condemn the ``excessive use of force'' by Israeli troops. The United States, Israel and four other countries voted against the nonbinding resolution. Israel's Foreign Ministry condemned the action, saying the vote ignored the mob killing of two Israeli soldiers and the desecration of Jewish holy sites. The Israelis also criticized the Palestinian Authority for not doing more to restrain militants who ``use live fire everywhere, including against Israeli citizens, and send women and children to clash with us.''

hello, everyone. i'm holly firfer, sitting in for judy fortin. here's our top story -- as palestinians bury their dead, the violence in the streets of the mideast continues. and arab leaders begin a meeting in cairo, trying to develop a unified position on the whole situation. egyptian president hosni mubarak opened the emergency arab league summit with a statement blaming israel for adopting a belligerent attitude which threatens the essence of peace. palestinian authority president yasser arafat accused israel of "mass killing and barbarian bombing." he called on the arab leaders to take a stand "befitting the sacrifices" of the palestinian people. our choice is the choice of permanent, comprehensive and just peace, and our aim is to liberate our land and to create our independence state in palestinian blast land with jerusalem as its capital and the return of our refugees to their homes. while leaders and spokesmen for both sides talk, the fighting goes on. richard blystone reports on the latest round of violence in the mideast. the studied words of the diplomats and the cries in the street seem to come from two different worlds, fresh clashes in the gaza strip on the mediterranean coast and in the west bank, fighting springs from the funerals for at least nine palestinians killed friday in some of the worst clashes in this three-week conflict. a new intifada, successor to the four-year street campaign that ended with palestinian/israeli negotiations a decade ago. according to a leader of yasser arafat's fateh movement. a counterview from dan meridor, chairman of israel's defense and foreign affairs committee. when i hear the palestinians saying on television we are at the war of independence of palestine, i understand they prefer war to peace. a stupid and difficult historic mistake, but we have to face it. overnight, a new development on israel's northern border. the defense reports an attack at the border fence. one body was found after israelis responded with small arms, tanks and helicopters from lebanon, the hezbollah movement which waged a war of attrition with the israelis before they withdrew from south lebanon in may, says its fighters were not involved. as the weeks wear on, the words of diplomats and leaders seem more and more irrelevant. reaction follows reaction. the initiative is in the streets. richard blystone, cnn, jerusalem. the u.n. general assembly has passed a resolution that is critical of israel's use of force against palestinians. it also condemns israeli excessive use of force by palestinians. it calls israeli settlements in the occupied territories illegal and an obstacle to peace. 46 nations abstained from the vote. six others oppose the measure, including israel and the united states. they say it sends a negative message.

Israeli soldiers and Palestinians militants skirmished in the roiling streets of the West Bank and Gaza Strip on Saturday, leaving three Palestinians dead and more than 100 injured in renewed battles that showed no signs of abating. Also, tens of thousands of Palestinians marched in funerals and protests, with some activists taking the unusual step of torching photos of moderate Arab leaders who maintain contacts with Israel and close ties with the United States. The unrest in Palestinian cities came as Arab leaders opened a summit in neighboring Egypt, unanimously condemning Israel for the more than three weeks of violence that have left 116 dead and more than 2,000 wounded, the vast majority Palestinian. As the violence raged, a cease-fire mediated by President Clinton at a Mideast summit on Tuesday appears to have disintegrated. Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak said Friday that he would call an open-ended ``time-out'' after the Arab summit ends Sunday to rethink Israeli policy concerning the peace talks. Until now, a peace agreement with the Palestinians had been Barak's top priority. Meanwhile, Amar Hassan, 28, a Palestinian taking part in a massive West Bank funeral march, said confrontation, not peace talks, will bring Palestinian independence. ``We should stop throwing stones,'' said Hassan. ``We should learn how to shoot, how to plant explosives near the roads.'' Some 20,000 mourners took part in the funeral procession in Nablus, where four Palestinian activists were shot and killed a day earlier. A lead truck carried masked militiamen hoisting their assault rifles and many carried flags of Arab countries, appealing for support from the summit. ``Oh Arabs, pay attention, the Palestinians are getting killed,'' the crowd chanted. In a rare display of hostility aimed at moderate Arab leaders, Palestinian marchers at a protest in Hebron burned photos of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, Jordan's King Abdullah II, Morocco's King Mohammed VI and Saudi Arabia's King Fahd. Those Arab leaders are all strong supporters of the Palestinians, though Jordan and Egypt also have diplomatic relations with Israel, while Morocco and Saudi Arabia have close ties with the United States, Israel's leading ally. ``Mubarak, Abdullah and King Mohammed are traitors employed by the CIA,'' read one banner. Marwan Barghouti, a prominent member of Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's Fatah movement, predicted that the Palestinians would continue to take to the streets. ``There is great popular participation in this intefadeh (uprising),'' Barghouti said. ``This intefadeh will continue until the end of the occupation.'' A stone-throwing confrontation on the main street of Hebron in the West Bank escalated into an exchange of gunfire, witnesses said. A taxi driver away from the site of the clash was killed when he was hit in the head by a bullet, doctors said. But the Israeli army said it did not use any live fire Saturday in the area where the Palestinian was shot in Hebron, which has been the scene of almost daily clashes. In the Gaza Strip, 16-year-old Omar al-Bihassi was shot and killed in a confrontation near the town of Khan Yunis, and a rock-throwing clash broke out near the Erez crossing with Israel. At least 59 Palestinians were injured, according to Dr. Mouauia Hassina at the Shifa Hospital. ``My son, my son. They killed my son,'' wailed the boy's mother, Widad, at his funeral on Saturday afternoon. Heavy shooting in the West Bank town of Ramallah, another chronic trouble spot, left one Palestinian dead and 45 injured, according to doctors at the Ramallah hospital. Saturday's violence came on the heels of heavy fighting that left nine Palestinians dead and 103 injured on Friday, the deadliest day in two weeks. After the Arab summit ends, the Israeli government said it may complete its assessment on ``unilateral separation'' from the Palestinians.

The family that owns the Mexico City disco that caught fire, killing 19 people, has dozens of other nightspots in the capital _ and a history of legal violations. One of the family's most popular clubs, The Lobohombo, caught fire before dawn Friday, forcing dozens of patrons to flee toward the only available exit. Many said they were blocked from leaving the burning building by guards who insisted they show tickets proving they had paid their bill. Authorities have shut down the club 11 times for code violations, but the owners managed to negotiate its reopening each time, according to Dolores Padierna, a local neighborhood official. Mexico City Mayor Rosario Robles has criticized the judges that allowed the disco to remain open, saying the city will lodge a complaint against them. She also called for officials to detain one of the owners, Alejandro Iglesias Rebollo, on homicide charges. Authorities were searching Saturday for the disco's owners. Before dawn, they raided a home believed to belong to Iglesias, but he was not there. Officials also searched two of the family's 80 other Mexico City nightclubs and found nothing. An attorney for the disco's owners, Victor Trejo Sanchez, denied that officials had tried to close Lobohombo. City officials inspected and approved the club in June, he told the Radio Red network. Several survivors, many who escaped with severe burns, said they were trapped inside the club by guards insisting they pay their bill. ``Everyone was shouting,'' survivor Sara Falcon told TV Azteca news, wiping away tears. ``Many people were on fire, yelling and throwing themselves on the floor. Others were yelling, 'Open the door because people are burning!' '' Salvador Garcia, interviewed by Televisa news from his hospital bed, said the crowd began to panic once the lights went out. ``Everyone started pushing each other and running over each other, and in the middle of the tragedy I asked God to help me. I threw myself into the crowd, and two of my colleagues pulled me out of there,'' he said. Officials were investigating the cause of the blaze. The disco, with its mirrored facade and large dance floor, was popular with celebrities. Gloria Estefan held a party there in August, and salsa superstar Willie Colon had performed there. But the club's owners had often clashed with city officials. Lobohombo was operating with a permit for a restaurant rather than a nightclub, authorities said. Its 4,700 square feet surpassed the maximum size permitted by law, and it often held thousands more that its maximum capacity of 1,000 people. According to the National Association of Discos and Bars, 15,000 establishments are in violation of minimum safety standards in Mexico. Many close long after set hours of operation, while others allow such illegal activities as prostitution and use of drugs.

Israeli soldiers and Palestinians militants skirmished in the roiling streets of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, leaving four Palestinians dead and more than 100 injured Saturday. Israel also sharply criticized Yasser Arafat, saying the Palestinian leader had ``brought down'' the peace process. Tens of thousands of Palestinians marched in funerals and protests, with some activists taking the unusual step of torching photos of moderate Arab leaders who maintain contacts with Israel and close ties with the United States.

Arafat told the Cairo summit that despite ``the worst kinds of mass killings ... our choice is the choice of permanent, just and comprehensive peace.'' Still, Israeli government spokesman Nachman Shai described the overall tone of Arafat's speech as ``very extreme.'' ``For the past seven years he was the partner for peace,'' Shai said in an interview with The Associated Press. ``We were absolutely sure and convinced he was going to make peace with us. But in a few weeks, everything collapsed, everything was brought down by him.'' A cease-fire mediated by President Clinton at a summit on Tuesday appeared to have disintegrated as the violence raged. After the Arab summit ends Sunday, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak will decide whether to call a ``time-out'' and rethink Israel's policy on the peace talks, which have been his top priority. ``Arafat changed his mind. I don't know why,'' said Shai. ``Maybe we should wait now for a while.'' Ziad Abu Zayyad, a prominent Palestinian politician, said Barak had not made any real progress toward a political settlement, and a formal suspension of the peace process would have little meaning. ``It's frozen already,'' he said.

In the Israeli coastal city of Haifa, thousands of Jews and Arab Israelis rallied for an end to the clashes with signs reading ``No more violence.''

An Arab summit called to confront a frightening and deadly upsurge in Israeli-Palestinian violence ended Sunday with a declaration that Arab countries may consider cutting ties with Israel, but did not call on them to do so. ``Arab leaders assert in the light of the collapse of the peace process their commitment to standing up to Israeli attempts to infiltrate the Arab world under any name and to the halting of establishing any relations with Israel,'' said the final declaration, read by Arab League Secretary-General Esmat Abdel-Meguid. The declaration, read live on national television, went on to say the Arabs would hold Israel responsible for the cancellation of relations. The carefully worded statement addressed what emerged as the most contentious issue before the leaders meeting in Cairo: Whether ties several have with the Jewish state should be reconsidered.

An Arab summit called to confront a frightening and deadly upsurge in Israeli-Palestinian violence ended Sunday with a declaration that Arab countries may consider cutting ties with Israel, but did not call on them to do so. Arabs ``hold Israel responsible for any steps taken in regard to relations with Israel by Arab countries, including their cancelation,'' said the final declaration, read by Arab League Secretary-General Esmat Abdel-Meguid to a live television audience across the region. Referring to establishing new ties, the declaration also said: ``Arab leaders assert in the light of the collapse of the peace process their commitment to standing up to Israeli attempts to infiltrate the Arab world under any name and to the halting of establishing any relations with Israel,'' The carefully worded statement addressed what had emerged as the most contentious issue before the leaders meeting in Cairo: Whether ties several have with the Jewish state should be reconsidered. Libya had walked out Saturday, the first day of the two-day summit, saying it was frustrated that the gathering would not clearly call for an end to ties with Israel. Egypt and Jordan have diplomatic relations with Israel. Mauritania, a west African nation that is a member of the Arab League, opened diplomatic relations with Israel in January. Oman, which along with Qatar had lower level ties, suspending relations Oct. 12, closing Israel's trade mission in Muscat, the capital, and withdrawing its trade envoy from Tel Aviv. Libya had said cutting such ties was the least Arabs could do in response to more than three weeks of Israeli-Palestinian violence that has left 117 dead and more than 2,000 wounded _ the vast majority Palestinian. While the summit was unified in holding Israel solely to blame for the violence and for bringing the peace process to an impasse, moderates warned against doing anything that might make future negotiations difficult. Egypt and Jordan, the only Arab countries with peace treaties and diplomatic relations with Israel, insist negotiations are the only way to bring lasting peace to the region. Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak had opened the summit with an acknowledgment of Arabs' anger, but warned against ``surrendering to our emotions.'' Mubarak also called on Israel to prove that it, too, wanted peace. But among ordinary Arabs, the outcome was likely to fuel criticism already being heard: that Arab leaders are divided and unwilling to confront Israel. The summit was declared a failure in a scathing front-page editorial Sunday in Lebanon's Ad-Diyar by the newspaper's editor and publisher, Charles Ayyoub. ``How can the summit succeed while the majority of Arab rulers have accepted the restrictions of agreements with Israel and the restrictions of subservience to America?'' Ayyoub wrote. ``The Arab world needs freedom and democracy.'' Summit speeches were broadcast live throughout the Arab world. Among those who watched was Fayrouz Mohamed al-Sayed, a university student who helps out at her father's grocery store in Cairo. ``The Libyans were right to leave _ a statement or a condemnation is not going to change anything,'' al-Sayed said Saturday, pointing to a small TV behind the counter replaying a summit speech by Morocco's King Mohammed VI. ``I know a war would be hard to win, but if we are going to die then we should die with pride.'' But even Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat appeared to take a moderate tone, saying, ``Our choice is the choice of permanent, just and comprehensive peace.'' Even so, Israeli government spokesman Nachman Shai called the overall tone of Arafat's speech ``very extreme.'' The first Arab summit in four years followed the collapse of a cease-fire Mubarak and President Clinton helped broker this week at Egypt's Sharm el-Sheik resort. Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak said he would call an open-ended ``time-out'' after the Arab summit to rethink Israel's peace policy. Israel was watching the summit closely for signs of how the Palestinians might proceed once they receive the backing of fellow Arabs. Also Sunday, Arab foreign ministers signed a pledge to hold annual summits, starting with a meeting presided over by Jordan in March. The Arab League has been unable to hold regular summits since its members split over Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait. In all 16 heads of state, including the acting head of state of Saudi Arabia, attended, representing: Algeria, Bahrain, Comoros, Djibouti, Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco, the Palestinian territories, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, Tunisia and Yemen. The remaining six Arab League members _ Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, Mauritania, Oman and the United Arab Emirates _ were represented by deputies of their heads of state.

Although the declaration held Israel responsible for the deterioration of relations with Arab countries, it is unlikely to satisfy many Arabs who had called for tougher action following three weeks of Israeli-Palestinian violence that has left 117 dead and more than 2,000 wounded _ the vast majority Palestinians. ``Arab leaders assert in the light of the collapse of the peace process their commitment to standing up to Israeli attempts to infiltrate the Arab world under any name and to the halting of establishing any relations with Israel,'' said the final declaration, read by Arab League Secretary-General Esmat Abdel-Meguid to a live television audience across the region. The carefully worded statement addressed what had emerged as the most contentious issue before the leaders meeting in Cairo: Whether ties several have with the Jewish state should be reconsidered. Libya had walked out Saturday, the first day of the two-day summit, saying it was frustrated that the gathering would not clearly call for an end to ties with Israel. Egypt and Jordan have diplomatic relations with Israel. Mauritania, a west African nation that is a member of the Arab League, opened diplomatic relations with Israel in January. Oman, which along with Qatar had lower level ties, suspended relations on Oct. 12, closing Israel's trade mission in Muscat, the capital, and withdrawing its trade envoy from Tel Aviv. While the summit was unified in holding Israel solely to blame for the violence and for bringing the peace process to an impasse, moderates warned against doing anything that might make future negotiations difficult. Egypt and Jordan, the only Arab countries with peace treaties and diplomatic relations with Israel, insist negotiations are the only way to bring lasting peace to the region. The summit also called on the United Nations to investigate the causes of the violence, an apparent rejection of a similar U.S.-led committee called for at the Israeli-Palestinian summit in Egypt last week. The Arabs added an international court similar to the Rwandan and Yugoslav war crimes tribunals should be formed to try ``those responsible for the violence.'' The summit declaration asked the United Nations to consider forming an international force to protect Palestinians living under Israeli occupation. Saudi Arabia contributed $50 million to a planned $200 million Arab League fund to aid the families of Palestinians killed in the recent violence. Arabs around the world were asked to contribute one day's pay to help Palestinians. Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak had opened the summit with an acknowledgment of Arabs' anger, but warned against ``surrendering to our emotions.'' Mubarak also called on Israel to prove that it, too, wanted peace. But among ordinary Arabs, the outcome was likely to fuel criticism already being heard: that Arab leaders are divided and unwilling to confront Israel. The summit was declared a failure in a scathing front-page editorial Sunday in Lebanon's Ad-Diyar by the newspaper's editor and publisher, Charles Ayyoub. ``How can the summit succeed while the majority of Arab rulers have accepted the restrictions of agreements with Israel and the restrictions of subservience to America?'' Ayyoub wrote. ``The Arab world needs freedom and democracy.'' But even Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat appeared to take a moderate tone, saying, ``Our choice is the choice of permanent, just and comprehensive peace.'' Even so, Israeli government spokesman Nachman Shai called the overall tone of Arafat's speech ``very extreme.'' The first Arab summit in four years followed the collapse of a cease-fire Mubarak and President Clinton helped broker this week at Egypt's Sharm el-Sheik resort. Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak said he would call an open-ended ``time-out'' after the Arab summit to rethink Israel's peace policy. Israel was watching the summit closely for signs of how the Palestinians might proceed once they receive the backing of fellow Arabs. Also Sunday, Arab foreign ministers signed a pledge to hold annual summits, starting with a meeting presided over by Jordan in March. The Arab League has been unable to hold regular summits since its members split over Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait. In all 16 heads of state, including the acting head of state of Saudi Arabia, attended, representing: Algeria, Bahrain, Comoros, Djibouti, Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco, the Palestinian territories, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, Tunisia and Yemen. The remaining six Arab League members _ Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, Mauritania, Oman and the United Arab Emirates _ were represented by deputies of their heads of state.

Ten months after an army coup shattered this nation's reputation for political tranquility and brought a military government to power, Ivory Coast was voting Sunday in presidential elections that the country's two largest parties are boycotting. Gen. Robert Guei, the military ruler who came to power during the December coup promising to step down quickly, faces serious competition from just one of his four opponents in the controversial vote: history professor and longtime opposition leader Laurent Gbagbo. Most candidates, including those from the country's two largest political parties, were disqualified last month by the Supreme Court. On Saturday, as the two-week campaign season came to a close, Gbagbo urged his supporters to watch for fraud during the election. ``Go tomorrow to vote. Be vigilant, be there at every polling station to oversee the vote,'' he told cheering supporters at a rally in Abidjan, Ivory Coast's main city. Campaigning has been largely muted in Ivory Coast. Guei, whose own soldiers have staged two mutinies since the coup and who, officials say, survived an assassination attempt in September, has barely appeared in public, apparently fearful of his security. The country's best-known opposition candidate, Alassane Dramane Ouattara, was excluded because of what the Supreme Court said were questions over whether both his parents were of ``Ivorian origin,'' as a new junta-backed constitution requires. Ouattara's Rally of the Republicans (RDR) and the former ruling Democratic Party of the Ivory Coast (PDCI), whose candidates were also excluded, have both called for a boycott of the polls. While it was too early to predict national turnout, it appeared to be nearly nonexistent Sunday morning in Korhogo, the main city in northern Ivory Coast, where Ouattara has his base of power. Two polling stations had no people in line and another had just four waiting for voting to begin, one hour after the scheduled 8 a.m. opening. ``As you can see, the north is sleeping through this election,'' said polling station worker, Drissa Dialo. The United Nations, the Organization of African Unity, the European Union and countries such as the United States and Canada have withdrawn election observers or funding to protest Guei's decision to run and the exclusion of major opponents. The past year has seen Ivory Coast suffer under through a series of crises that have badly blemished its longtime reputation for stability and relative wealth. Its economy has been crippled by a steep decline in prices for its primary exports, cocoa and coffee, while the December takeover and the two subsequent mutinies have frightened Ivorians and foreign investors alike.

The candidates in Sunday's election to restore civilian rule in the West African country of Ivory Coast. Gen. Robert Guei, 59: Ivory Coast's junta leader took power in a Dec. 24 coup. He initially said he wasn't interested in power, but has since traded his military uniform for a suit and tie to run as ``the people's candidate.'' A French-trained career soldier, he served as military chief from 1990 until 1995. A longtime nemesis of ousted President Henri Konan Bedie, he was removed from the military in the wake of unclear allegations that he tried to plan a 1995 coup. ___ Laurent Gbagbo, 55: Leader of the Ivorian Popular Front (FPI). A history professor, trade unionist and longtime opposition leader, he is the only political heavyweight opposing Guei in Sunday's election. He lost a run for the presidency in the country's first multiparty elections in 1990 and led a boycott of the 1995 poll, which he denounced as undemocratic. ___ Francis Wodie, 64: Leader of the Ivorian Worker's Party (PIT). A law professor and trade unionist, he is considered an intellectual without a strong national following. He was Bedie's only challenger in the 1995 election and later served as minister of higher education. ___ Theodore Mel Eg, 48: A former businessman and mayor of Abidjan's wealthy Cocody suburb. He was active for many years in the former ruling Democratic Party of Ivory Coast and is now running for the newly formed Democratic Union of Ivory Coast. ___ Nicolas Dioulo, 58: A retired UNESCO official, he is running as an independent candidate.

With most candidates barred, the two largest parties boycotting, and a military ruler seeking to entrench his power as a civilian, residents of this West African nation trickled to polling stations Sunday to elect a new president. The voting came 10 months after an army coup brought a junta to power, sparking a series of political crises and leaving this nation's reputation for political tranquility in shreds. Junta leader Gen. Robert Guei faces serious competition from just one of his four opponents in the controversial vote; history professor and longtime opposition leader Laurent Gbagbo. Most candidates, including those from the country's two largest political parties, were disqualified last month by the Supreme Court. The United Nations, the Organization of African Unity, the European Union and countries such as the United States and Canada have withdrawn election observers or funding, saying the exclusion of major opponents have made a truly free and fair election impossible. Although national figures were not yet available, voting appeared light at polling stations in a number of Ivorian cities, with most reporting less than 30 percent turnout by early afternoon. Voters were nearly nonexistent in many parts of Korhogo, the main city in the north and a stronghold of support for the now-disqualified opposition leader, Alassane Dramane Ouattara. ``As you can see, the north is sleeping through this election,'' polling worker, Drissa Dialo said at one empty voting station. Ouattara's Rally of the Republicans (RDR) and the former ruling Democratic Party of the Ivory Coast (PDCI), whose candidates were also excluded by the court, have both called for a boycott of the polls. The chief justice of the Supreme Court has close ties to Guei, who had insisted in December that he would quickly cede power to a civilian. ``The general came to sweep the house (clean), but he didn't leave, he didn't keep his promise,'' said Bema Coulibaly, a Korhogo resident who said he wouldn't be voting Sunday. Campaigning has been muted in Ivory Coast. Guei (pronounced GAY-ee), whose own soldiers have staged two mutinies since the coup and who, officials say, survived an assassination attempt in September, has barely appeared in public, apparently fearful of his security. But while he has thrown the weight of the junta behind his election, Guei has insisted he will step down if he loses. ``Ivory Coast is a country of peace, where everything takes place in serenity,'' he said Sunday after voting amid heavy security at a primary school near his house, in an upscale Abidjan neighborhood. Guei has seen his popularity wane since the December coup, when cheering crowds filled the streets of some neighborhoods to welcome the ouster of President Henri Konan Bedie, who was widely seen as corrupt and ethnically divisive. But for some Ivorians, Guei is still seen as the only candidate who can control Ivory Coast's politically divided and often-thuggish security forces. ``Without him, there would have been civil war,'' said Nicodeme Zan, a voter in Abidjan. Gbagbo (pronounced BAHG-bo), for his part, said he believed most of Ivory Coast's 5.5 million registered voters would oppose Guei, who for many remains a soldier _ albeit one who now sports a suit and tie. ``In Ivory Coast's present state, I find it unlikely that they will vote in a military man to head the government,'' he said just before casting his ballot. Many of his supporters are already referring to Gbagbo as ``president,'' and some have warned they will take to the streets if he is not declared the winner. ``The soldiers have done their job now and they must go back to the barracks,'' said Jean-Pierre Nassoue, 35, who writes for a true-crime magazine. ``It doesn't matter who wins, just not a soldier.'' Ouattara, the country's best-known opposition candidate, was excluded after the Supreme Court said there were questions over whether both his parents were of ``Ivorian origin,'' as a new junta-backed constitution requires. The past year has seen Ivory Coast suffer through a series of crises, including the two military mutinies and a further erosion of the country's economy, already battered by a steep decline in prices for its primary exports, cocoa and coffee. The instability has frightened Ivorians and foreign investors alike. To win Sunday's election, a candidate must capture more than 50 percent of the vote or a run-off will be held 15 days after the first-round results are officially declared. Early results from the election are expected late Sunday or early Monday.

Arabs across the Middle East condemned the resolutions of an emergency summit on Sunday, criticizing their leaders for not taking firmer action to punish Israel for using excessive force against the Palestinians. ``It was a total failure, but we never expected anything more than lip-service from our leaders,'' said Jordanian electrician Abdullah Ayyoub, 27. Wafa Freih, 32, a secretary, said the summit ``has failed to meet the minimum expectations of the Arab people in taking a firm action against the Israeli massacres of innocent Palestinians.'' In Egypt, thousands of students staged noisy demonstrations, venting their frustration at the summit's failure to cut ties with Israel and reiterating calls for a holy war to liberate the Palestinians. ``Where is the Arab army?'' they chanted angrily. Arab radios broadcast patriotic songs as satellite stations showed images of weeping mothers and blood-covered Palestinians wounded in the violence since Sept. 28. Nearly 120 people have died, mostly Palestinians. The final summit statement said Arab countries may consider cutting ties with Israel, but did not insist they do so. It called on the United Nations to investigate the causes of the violence and consider an international force to protect Palestinians living under Israeli occupation. It also sought an international court to try ``those responsible for the violence.'' Two leftist Palestinian factions based in Syria _ the Popular and Democratic fronts for the liberation of Palestine _ said the summit's declaration was below expectations. A political analyst in Saudi Arabia, Abdulrahman al-Humaidan, said Arab leaders could have cut ties with Israel and delivered a ``clear warning to the United States that it's complete bias toward Israel would no longer be tolerated.'' But in Kuwait, political science professor Shamlan al-Issa said the summit outcome fell ``somewhere in between'' success and failure, and that it showed the ``era of shouting slogans and beating drums was over.'' Elsewhere in the Gulf, 155 legislators in the Iranian Majlis, or parliament, voted by a simple majority to make arrangements for an international gathering in support of the Palestinian intefadeh, or uprising, the official Islamic Republic News Agency reported Sunday. In a smoke-filled coffee shop in the bustling and narrow streets of downtown Amman, six Jordanian technicians watched the live broadcast of the summit's closing session in Egypt. ``It is only talk, but no deeds,'' said Raed al-Khalidi, 21. His friends banged on the table when the summit leaders declared that Arabs may consider cutting ties with Israel. ``We want war. We want jihad (holy war) to liberate Jerusalem and Palestine from Jewish occupiers,'' shouted Mahmoud Abu-Shanab, 22. ``Arab leaders should open the borders and let the people fight Israel.'' At a bookshop in the commercial Jebel Amman district, cashier Julia Shamseddine, 23, said: ``We can go to war with Israel and we can beat it with the strong armies of Iraq, Iran and Syria. We are for war because peace is futile.''

Eager to demonstrate a get-tough attitude toward Israel while keeping the door ajar to a resumption of peace talks, Arab leaders said Sunday that they would freeze all but formal diplomatic contact with Israel until it made tangible progress toward a final settlement with the Palestinians. In a strongly worded but carefully calibrated statement signed by all but one member of the 22-nation Arab League, the leaders accused Israel of committing atrocities in the last three weeks of clashes with Palestinians. They urged the United Nations to set up a war crimes tribunal to judge Israeli actions and pledged vast aid to relieve the battered Palestinian economy. But they stopped well short of renouncing the peace treaties that Egypt and Jordan have already signed with Israel and did not suggest that the Palestinians themselves reject further negotiations in pursuit of an independent state. Instead, the Arab League _ which at its first summit meeting in four years was under severe scrutiny from the Palestinians and their supporters throughout the Arab world _ said it would end its participation in all official and unofficial efforts to integrate Israel into the economy of the Middle East. The low-level diplomatic contacts that have started in the last few years between Arab states and Israel, including trade and political exchanges, would also be suspended. ``We are not going to let Israel do whatever it wants,'' Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Mousa declared, speaking to reporters. ``We have all this pressure on us, telling us that Israel needs to feel a part of the region. Well, if it wants to be part of the region, it has to act according to the law.'' The statement from the meeting did not directly criticize the United States for supporting Israel, as the leaders had asserted in their public speeches. But it did take a swipe at Washington, insisting that Jerusalem should not be recognized as the capital of Israel. President Clinton had said in July that he might consider moving the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv, where most nations have their diplomatic representation, to disputed Jerusalem. The Arab leaders said they would break relations with any country that did so before negotiations settle Jerusalem's internationally recognized status as a disputed city. The Arab leaders seemed conscious that this summit was a test of credibility for the Arab League, which in its 55-year history has been fractured, uniting most easily over the treatment of the Palestinians. Mousa, acting as an unofficial spokesman for the leaders gathered here, took care to underline that Arab governments were not indifferent to the anger on their streets at Israeli conduct. Libya proclaimed itself the voice of stifled Arab masses yearning for a complete break with Israel. Its delegates walked out of the summit meeting a few hours after it convened on Saturday, dismissing the Arab League deliberations as a rhetorical exercise that would merely result in empty threats to Israel. Arab leaders generally regard Libya and its erratic leader, Col. Moammar Gadhafi, as a perpetually maverick element in their midst, but they clearly feared that their summit might be perceived in much the same terms by their own people. In the Arab world, public preoccupation with the bloodshed in the Palestinian territories _ in which more than 120 have died, all but eight of them Arabs _ has sparked mass demonstrations and open calls for war. Many commentators on Arabic television and in newspapers have speculated that the protests could turn against the authoritarian Arab regimes. Again and again, Mousa found himself on the defensive when confronted by Arab journalists, who repeatedly questioned whether the Arab League was truly in touch with the public mood and would follow through on its promises. ``We _ all of us here _ are part of the Arab public,'' he responded, adding that ``all Arabs _ left, right and center and whoever represents them, whether governments, the street or students _ are angry.'' ``We mean business here,'' Mousa declared. Immediately after the summit, Tunisia announced that it would shut its political liaison office in Tel Aviv and close the corresponding Israeli office in Tunis. A government statement said the break was in response to ``bloody Israeli aggression against the fraternal Palestinian people.'' Oman has already closed a small Israeli trade office that was operating in Muscat. Qatar said Sunday it would ``calmly'' consider the possibility of closing the Israeli trade office in its capital. Morocco has a junior diplomat still stationed in Tel Aviv. The Arab leaders, who have unanimously backed the Palestinian demand for Arab sovereignty over East Jerusalem, also noted that Jerusalem's status is internationally acknowledged as a subject for negotiation. The Arab leaders, as a group, also said they would boycott any official or unofficial gatherings with Israeli on regional economic cooperation. That freeze is likely to have more of a political than practical effect, since Syria and Lebanon have boycotted such meetings ever since they were initiated after the Madrid peace conference in 1991, and the talks have been infrequent. It was not clear if Arab nations would not go to international gatherings attended by Israel, like economic development conferences sponsored by the European Union. The Cairo gathering, the first Arab League summit meeting in a decade to include Iraq, brought together the divergent trends in the Arab world. Persian Gulf kings and princes, wearing long white robes and gilt-edged gauzy cloaks, mingled with Arab presidents in business suits. But their old divisions were not healed. Representatives of Kuwait and Saudi Arabia refused to even make eye contact with delegates from Iraq, which had been banished from Arab League summits after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait. An Iraqi official said that even the president of Mauritania turned his back on him. Mauritania, one of Iraq's biggest boosters during the Gulf War, broke relations with Baghdad after the Iraqis condemned it for establishing relations with Israel. The Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, in his trademark military uniform, looked drawn and shrunken, far from the lively and excitable figure he once cut at Arab meetings. During the televised speeches, he frequently appeared detached and when the leaders gathered between sessions to chat and embrace, he was often seen standing alone. He had lost the financial support of the Gulf nations after he backed Iraq in the Gulf War. With their own people supporting the Palestinians very publicly, Arab leaders decided to offer Arafat their full political support and promised $1 billion in aid to protect Islamic and Arab properties in Jerusalem and to help the families of Palestinians killed or injured in the fighting with Israel. The summit provided a glimpse of the shape of future disputes among the Arab leaders. Iraq and Syria, using different language, urged the Arab states to develop a long-term strategy that approaches Israel as a rival military and economic power. The young Syrian president Bashar Assad revived a perennial theme: that only by combining their financial and military power could the Arabs forge what he called a ``peace of the strong'' rather than a peace founded on the perceived weakness of Arab nations. Iraq, taking a different tack, proposed a vision of the Arab world that would reject alliances with the United States. As things stand, however, Egypt, which commands the strongest military machine in the Arab world, maintains close ties with the United States, Israel's leading ally, and conducts joint military exercises with American troops. Most of the Persian Gulf states also have military cooperation agreements with the United States. Using oil as a weapon, which squeezed the West after the 1973 Arab-Israeli war, has been disavowed by Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, also close American allies. A few of the Arab leaders, notably the young kings of Morocco and Jordan, took note of the changed circumstances. They argued that military consolidation is outdated, that the world around the Middle East has organized itself into common markets, and that the Arabs should concentrate on competing economically and technologically. This summit declaration went a few steps further than the statement agreed upon in 1996, after the last meeting of Arab heads of state. Convened after the election of the right-wing Benjamin Netanyahu as prime minister of Israel, the Arab leaders then warned Israel that they would adjust the pace of normalizing relations according to progress in the peace talks. The public theme of this weekend's summit, however, was that the peace process, in the form it has been conducted since the Oslo agreement in 1993, is no longer valid. Mousa dismissed Israel's peace-making activity as little more than ``shuttling to Washington and photo opportunities.'' The uprising by Palestinians, the summit statement said, is a direct outcome of Israel's ``inflexibility, stalling and failure to implement its commitments.''

Ten months after the military seized power in an initially popular coup, Ivorians voted on Sunday in a presidential election that included the putsch leader and four civilian candidates, but excluded those of the two biggest parties. The ballot, which followed tense weeks when political and ethnic rivalries pushed this West African nation on a knife-edge, took place peacefully across the country. Voter turnout, perhaps the most critical factor in an election that was boycotted by the two major parties, appeared low at a dozen voting stations here in the commercial capital. The election, whose results were not expected until Monday at the earliest, pitted the junta leader, Gen. Robert Guei, against Laurent Gbagbo, the leader of the Ivorian Popular Front, the country's third largest party, as well as three little-known candidates. Whatever the election's outcome, the winner will find it difficult to be recognized here and abroad. Most international observers withdrew from the Ivory Coast earlier this month after a court controlled by Guei eliminated the candidates of the two biggest parties, including the Rally of the Republicans led by Alassane D. Ouattara, a former deputy managing director of the International Monetary Fund. The United States and the European Union also cut their financial support toward the election, saying the election was flawed from the start. Inside the Ivory Coast, the 40 percent of the population that is Muslim felt alienated after the court eliminated all candidates from the Muslim north, leaving five, all Christians from the south. In recent months, both Guei and Gbagbo ran xenophobic campaigns aimed against northerners. Fear of what might follow the election cast a shadow over the vote on Sunday. In the working-class neighborhood of Yopougon, Leon Adouby, a 30-year-old accountant, woke up early this morning to stand in line before the polls opened at 8 a.m. Adouby, a longtime supporter of Gbagbo, was nevertheless worried that the country's oldest and richest party, the Democratic Party of the Ivory Coast, had not been allowed to participate. ``The PDCI is a heavyweight,'' Adouby said, using the party's French acronym. ``If you don't put the PDCI in this dance and a president is elected, the results won't be clear. Unfortunately, there will be a gap _ and that worries me.'' Guei, who ran as an independent after failing to become the candidate of the Democratic Party of the Ivory Coast, cast his ballot on Sunday at a school just outside his house. Dressed in a light-blue suit, the general, who barely campaigned because of security concerns, came to the voting station accompanied by scores of soldiers and police officers. ``The Ivory Coast is a country of peace where everything takes place in serenity,'' the general said. ``The winner will win.'' An hour later, Gbagbo, a socialist who is the country's oldest opposition figure, was more combative after voting. ``It's difficult for me to imagine that I could lose,'' he said, expressing worries that the general's supporters might commit fraud. He added: ``I hope the losers won't be sore losers.'' It was too early to tell how many of the country's 5.5 million registered voters came out. But in Abidjan visits to several neighborhoods indicated that turnout was lower than the one for a constitutional referendum in July, which had the participation of all the parties. This time, leaders of the Democratic Party of the Ivory Coast and the Rally of the Republicans _ which together won 75 percent of the votes in the 1995 legislative elections _ instructed their followers to boycott the vote. And so lines at voting booths were thin in neighborhoods like Adjame or Abobo, considered strongholds of the Rally of the Republicans. Many stations were deserted. Among voters interviewed at different stations, almost all said they had chosen Gbagbo. ``We must elect a civilian candidate,'' said Frederic Gbessi Guie, a 30-year-old teacher. ``We cannot reward a man who seized power by force. If he stays in power, our country's problems will continue. We'll still be cut off by the international donors.''

Ehud Barak called for a peace ``time-out'' and Yasser Arafat told him to ``go to hell.'' The Israeli and Palestinian leaders seemed further than ever Sunday from the peace their U.S. and Egyptian sponsors have tried so hard to salvage. The violence in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip showed no signs of abating, and the cease-fire called during last week's peace summit was little more than a memory. Four Palestinians died in clashes Sunday, two teen-agers in the Gaza Strip and two men near the West Bank town of Hebron. The death toll from three weeks of violence now stands at 121, most of them Palestinians. Palestinian gunmen in the Palestinian-held village of Beit Jalla and in Bethlehem fired on apartment buildings in Gilo, a suburb of Jerusalem. No injuries were immediately reported in Gilo. Israeli helicopter gunships retaliated by rocketing Beit Jalla in two hours of fighting that was among the fiercest in the Jerusalem environs since clashes broke out Sept. 28. Ten Palestinians were wounded, and electricity and phone lines were down in Beit Jalla, radio reports said. ``We need to have a time-out ... to reassess the peace process in light of the events of the last few weeks,'' Barak told his weekly Cabinet meeting Sunday. ``One would have to be blind to security and political needs to continue as if nothing has changed,'' he said. A statement issued by Barak's office did not say how long the ``time-out'' would last. Israeli negotiators would refuse to meet with their Palestinian counterparts until the time-out was lifted. Arafat, speaking after returning Sunday from a two-day Arab summit in Cairo, said the Palestinian state would come _ with or without the peace process, or Barak's approval. ``My response (to the time-out) is: our people are continuing their road to Jerusalem, the capital of the Palestinian state,'' he said. Whether Barak accepts that or not, ``let him go to hell,'' Arafat said. The intensification of the rhetoric came despite efforts by Egypt and the United States _ the principal sponsors of Israel and the Palestinians, respectively _ to salvage the peace process. Egypt and the United States convened the summit last week at the Egyptian resort of Sharm el-Sheikh that ended with a cease-fire declaration. The Americans said they would continue to work toward bringing the sides together. President Clinton was trying to reach Barak, said a White House spokesman traveling with him in New York. Clinton is still focused on getting the parties to stick to the Sharm el-Sheikh agreement ``to get us past the immediate violence,'' spokesman Elliot Diringer said. Egypt, meanwhile, headed off an Arab summit declaration that would mandate breaking off ties with Israel, effectively declaring the peace process dead. Arab nations ``hold Israel responsible for any steps taken in regard to relations with Israel by Arab countries, including their cancellation,'' said the final declaration of the Cairo summit. That fell short of efforts by radicals for a clear-cut call for ending ties with Israel _ and left intact Egypt's moderating role in the region. Barak thanked the Egyptians for moderating the summit but rejected the overall tone of the gathering. ``Israel rejects, truly categorically, the language of threats which emanated from the summit and condemns the call, implicit in the resolutions, for continuation of the violence,'' he told reporters. Barak has indicated that if the peace process fails, he would take unilateral steps to separate Israelis from the Palestinians by building a border between Israeli-held portions of the West Bank and those areas controlled by Palestinians. The Palestinians say that shows bad will. ``We got his message and in spite of the balanced, peaceful method of the Arab summit, he sent a message of war _ unilateral solutions,'' said Arafat's information minister, Yasser Abed Rabbo. The United States, Israel's main backer, warned against unilateral acts. ``Israelis and Palestinians are bound, even condemned, to live together, side by side,'' said U.S. Ambassador Martin Indyk. Israeli officials said any peace breakdown was Arafat's fault for not adhering to the latest cease-fire. ``We returned home; the violence only increased,'' Gilead Sher, Barak's chief of staff, told The Associated Press. ``We found ourselves faced with a Palestinian Authority that does not want, or is not able, or both, to take control of the mob.'' Barak accelerated efforts to bring the hard-line opposition leader Ariel Sharon into his teetering government before parliament reconvenes next week _ an alliance that would likely chill for months efforts at reviving the peace process. It was Sharon's Sept. 28 visit to a Jerusalem shrine holy to Muslims and Jews that sparked the violence.

Rounding the Final Turn Some had begun to doubt that it would ever arrive. But here it is at last: the home stretch. The time when pollsters take pulses daily, media consultants are kicking up the advertising buys a notch in swing states, and candidates, surrogates and pundits are coming to terms with the fallout from the debates. ``I thought he literally was going to hit him,'' Barbara Bush said on the campaign trail last week after the final of the three presidential forums, a town hall meeting in St. Louis. The former first lady was upset by what she concluded was Vice President Al Gore's effort to intimidate her son Gov. George W. Bush by crowding him on the stage of Washington University, an act that she said prompted her husband, former President George Bush, to shout at the television, ``My God!'' It is that time in the campaign season when nerves start to fray. And this year the tension is particularly high: polls indicate it could be the closest election since 1960. Consider the ramifications: The network anchors holding court in studios on the Eastern Seaboard might not call the race until after Californians get home from work and go to the polls. What if everyone had to stay up for Hawaii? After the debate, Gore and Bush resumed their transcontinental quests to win over the undecideds and persuade the ``persuadables,'' those waffling potential voters who are recruited by the news shows to fill the seats in their on-air focus groups. Each candidate was taking sharper aim at his rival. The Democrats ran new ads attacking Bush's environmental and education record in Texas. The Republicans replied with new spots labeling Gore a spendthrift who will rapidly run through the surplus. With just a bit more than two weeks to go, political analysts say, things are likely to get rougher. Fashion Forward Armed Forces At the dawning of a new century and millennium, the U.S. Army is undertaking what its chief of staff, Gen. Eric K. Shinseki, calls a ``transformation.'' This is a big deal, so big, in fact, that last week the general announced that all of his soldiers would get new caps. Starting next year, standard headgear for the Army's 480,000 soldiers and officers _ its cooks, its clerks, its drivers _ will be the black beret, which since 1975 has been the exclusive symbol of the Army's elite infantry cadre, the Rangers. This sartorial transformation spells the end of the rectangular hat _ known officially as the ``overseas cap,'' but more familiarly referred to as the ``envelope hat'' since it folds up as neatly as an envelope _ that has been in use for much of the past century. Shinseki announced his directive in a speech devoted to the challenges facing the Army, which has been slow to adapt to today's post-Cold War world. The black beret, he said, would symbolize his own proposals to make the Army a leaner, more agile force, ready to fight and win anywhere in the world. ``It will be a symbol of unity, a symbol of Army excellence, a symbol of our values,'' he declared. As symbolism goes, however, the directive fell flat. At a time when the Army is struggling to recruit soldiers, hold on to its young officers and maintain its tactical relevance when wars are far more likely to be fought with jets and missiles than ground troops, many soldiers called the beret little more than window dressing. Others gripes were more immediate. ``The beret leaves lines on your forehead,'' one staff sergeant said. As could have been predicted, the harshest response came from the Rangers. Like the Army's airborne soldiers, who wear maroon berets, and the special forces, who wear green (and who, contrary to Hollywood habit, do not like to be called ``green berets'') the Rangers consider the black beret a hard-earned badge of honor. How Just Is Justice in the Lone Star State? Texas Defender Service, a nonprofit group of defense lawyers, released a broad and scathing assessment of Texas' administration of the death penalty. The group found that the system was corroded with prosecutorial misconduct, racial bias and a failure to provide adequate counsel to indigent capital defendants. The report also said too many defendants are convicted based on unreliable testimony from jailhouse informants or from dubious experts. State officials and prosecutors rejected the claims. The Beginning of the End For the Cuba Boycott The Senate decisively approved legislation relaxing nearly 40 years of sanctions on the sale of food to Cuba. The measure, endorsed 86-8, now seems assured of becoming law, but anti-communist opponents of Fidel Castro's regime were successful in winning prohibitions on U.S. government credit and private financing for any sales, which will make it difficult, if not impossible, for food shipments to be made to Cuba in the near future. Colds and Heart Attacks Citing evidence that the active ingredient in dozens of decongestants and appetite suppressants poses a small risk of stroke in young women, a panel of scientific experts recommended the chemical be removed from over-the-counter products. Drug makers insist the ingredient, phenylpropanolamine, or PPA, is safe. A decision by the Food and Drug Administration is pending; meanwhile, officials advise consumers to read labels carefully. Relief for the Poorest Bono, Pat Robertson, George W. Bush and Pope John Paul II make a formidable lobbying quartet. The rock star, religious leaders and Republican presidential candidate joined forces to pressure Congress to finance the U.S. share of debt relief for 41 poor nations. Some senior Republican lawmakers have criticized the program, but congressional leaders say President Clinton is now likely to get the full $435 million he requested for the international program this year.

Yemeni authorities were questioning officials from a civil registration department, trying to find out about a fake identification card issued to a suicide bomber who blew a hole in the side of a U.S. warship, Yemeni sources close to the investigation said Sunday. One bomber was believed to have used a fake ID card indicating he was Abdullah Ahmed Khaled al-Musawah, a resident of Lahej, 22 miles north of Aden, the sources said, insisting on anonymity. Authorities believe more fake cards were issued by the civil registration office in Lahej, the sources said without elaborating. Officials of the civil registration office suspected of involvement in issuing the fake identification cards were among more than 60 people being held for questioning by Yemeni authorities, the sources said. All papers submitted by the applicant for the identification card that was issued in the name of al-Musawah were missing from the registration office, they said. The sources did not say when the attackers entered Yemen or where they came from, but said the fake cards were issued July 14, 1997, when the attackers were believed to be outside the country. People interviewed about the suspected bombers said their Arabic was of a Gulf dialect. Authorities have been searching houses and other locations believed to have been used by the attackers; two unidentified people had been staying in at least one of the houses and have not been seen since the Oct. 12 explosion, which killed 17 sailors aboard the USS Cole and injured 39 others. Meanwhile, the sources said three more houses in suburbs near the port were believed linked to the bombings, and investigators were searching them for clues. Authorities earlier had linked the suspects to at least one other house in Aden. A senior U.S. government official in Aden said a great deal of physical evidence had been moved from various locations under investigation. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said U.S. labs can perform some tests on the evidence that, because of technical limitations, Yemen cannot carry out. The senior official would not say what sort of evidence had been found or whether some already had been sent to the United States. At the site of the bombing, sailors continued repair work on the destroyer and divers collected forensic evidence from the sea bed.

With Middle East peace talks at a standstill, frustrated Palestinians in exile said Monday that the only way forward is to fight. ``I can sell my house and my belongings, have my 11 children fight and die as martyrs in the war for the sake of liberating Palestine from the Jews,'' said Walid al-Khatib, a 62-year-old Palestinian. ``What's more precious than our homeland?'' asked al-Khatib, who took refuge in Amman's Hussein Camp after fleeing the West Bank town of Hebron during the 1967 Middle East war. In the past three weeks, thousands of demonstrators in Egypt, Syria, Iran, Jordan and elsewhere across the Arab world have called for jihad, or holy war, against Israel. The calls came as frustration soared because of the faltering Middle East peace process, a sense that Arab leaders lack the will for firm action and Israel's call for a ``timeout'' in negotiations. ``The Jews never wanted peace,'' Karima Abdul-Rahim, 65, said with a sigh. ``We lived for 52 years without peace and we can live another 52 years without it,'' Abdul-Rahim said as she picked olives from a tree in her back yard. She originally was from Ramleh in what is now Israel proper. Across the street, shopkeeper Jihad Abu el-Samen, 56, said Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak ``is playing games'' with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and other Arab leaders. ``Barak's 'timeout' means he doesn't want peace,'' he said. ``If he doesn't want peace, then he wants war. And we tell him we want war, too, because the Jews only understand the language of force.'' Barak told his Cabinet the continuation of violence that erupted Sept. 28 between Palestinian demonstrators and Israeli security forces made it necessary for his government to take a ``timeout'' from the peace negotiations to assess the situation. An emergency Arab summit meeting Saturday and Sunday in Egypt held Israel responsible for the deadly violence. Leaders urged international intervention but did not require Arab governments that have made peace with Israel to sever their relations with the Jewish state. Foreign Minister Abdul-Illah Khatib said Jordan, which signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1994, will not cut ties with its neighbor. ``The peace doesn't need more blows,'' he said. Prime Minister Ali Abu-Ragheb told reporters that Barak's timeout declaration was ``unacceptable and lacks logic.'' Instead, Barak should return to the negotiating table, he added. At Hussein camp _ one of 13 camps in Jordan sheltering more than 1.57 million Palestinian refugees _ people blamed Arab leaders for what they described as Barak's ``defiance.'' ``It was a slap in the face of all Arab leaders, who have no guts to stand up and tell the criminal Barak, 'We want to cut ties with you,''' said Yousef Attallah, 26, from Lod in what is now Israel. Nidal Zahrawi, 29, a construction worker from the West Bank town of Beit Sahour, said ``Arab people should unite, defy their leaders and fight Israel.'' Both men's families fled to Jordan during the 1967 war. Zahrawi's co-worker, Mahmoud Taha, 32, from Hebron, nodded his head. But when asked if he would fight Israel if war were declared soon, he said: ``It doesn't have to be now.'' ``The Muslims will prevail in a war against the Jews, but not now. Maybe in the next generation or the one after,'' he said.

Secretary of State, Madeleine Albright has become the most senior Western official to visit communist North Korea in five decades of cold war confrontation. Albright met with the Supreme leader Kim Jong Il earlier today , and they'll meet again tomorrow. State department spokesman Richard Boucher says, Albright's trip is aimed at improving future relations. First and foremost what we are looking for out of this is steps on the key issues that we've been concerned about, on missiles, on nuclear weapons, on terrorism. As we make progress on the issues, we will build a better relationship with the North. And it's through that process that we get to bilateral relationships and issues like that. Albright will visit a kindergarten and a Food Aid distribution center while in North Korea.

This is The World. I am Lisa Mullins. Time to answer our Geo-quiz today, we are looking for a Chinese city located in Schezwan province. It was once the capital of China. The answer is Chong Qing, C-H-O -N-G-Q-I-N-G. And today Chong Qing has a new claim to fame, eighteen- year- old Lee Yun Dee, a native of the city, won first prize yesterday at the prestigious International Frederick Chopin Piano competition in Warsaw. The competition had been featured in an interview last week. Chong Qing and the rest of China are getting ready for a different sort of week this winter time, they are conducting a census to get an official count of the country's billion plus residents. Now for pointers they might look to Turkey, which did the census in a single day yesterday. It was possible because the Turkish government imposed a curfew, from dawn till dusk, forcing people to stay home or risk arrest. Reporter Douglas Franz wrote about the census in today's edition of The New York Times. Doug Franz, the curfew didn't apply to you as a non-citizen, so you were able to walk around. What did you see or maybe more appropriately, what didn't you see as the case maybe? Well, I have to say it was a good day for the fish in Istanbul yesterday. Usually when we walk along the Bosphorus here, there are literally thousands of fishermen on a Sunday, and yesterday there was not a fisherman on the banks on either side of the Bosphorus. The streets were just as empty as the banks. I mean it was really like a neutron bomb had gone off in Istanbul and left the buildings intact and all the people had disappeared. So this means no waiters or no cooks in the restaurants? That must have been kind of disappointing for tourists? Yes, I think it was tough day for tourists. Tourists were given special permission to go out, and on the plus side they could go to Topkapa Palace and some of the other really wonderful historic sites in Istanbul and not wait in line. But on the negative side there were no shops open, no restaurants yesterday. Now in order to accomplish this you say some towns took a carrot approach, some towns took a stick approach. Give us an example of both. I'll go with the carrot for the good side first. One of the town's Mayor, I think in North Central Turkey, held a concert on Saturday night, a free concert, to make sure people stayed in town and he invited the men of the town to invite their girlfriends and fiances to come to the concert and then stay overnight, so they could be counted the next day. On the other hand, in the capital of Turkey, Ankara, they set up a hotline where anyone who saw neighbors ducking out on the census, was asked to call the hotline and report them. And any old age pensioners who get free bus service who were caught skipping the census, were threatened with the loss of their bus service. And the point here, Lisa, is that for the municipal governments around Turkey all of which are funded through the National Budget, their budget allocation for the coming years is based on population and so they were all desperate to get their population up as high as possible. So they were intent on keeping their citizens at home. Well, maybe as part of the carrot approach there's a kind of an interesting social study going on here. Because according to what happened in past censuses, including the first one in 1927, they got people to stay home and nine months later you've got a little bit of a population boom. Yeah, that's right. In 1927 was the first year that they did the national census and people were required again to stay in their homes all day, and nine months later there was big boom of baby births and a surprising number of those babies had a new name in Turkey. It was called Nufus, N-U-F-U-S, which means census or population. And it will be interesting to see nine months from now if we have a similar population boom. Something else that's interesting though Doug, is that though the census itself doesn't go into some of the detail that the United States census even does. For instance, they don't ask anyone's ethnic background or religious affiliation? No, those are very sensitive issues here in Turkey and it goes back again to the creation of the modern Republic out of the ashes of the Ottoman Empire. It was Otto Turks strongest belief that in order for Turkey to be a unified modern nation, the concept of minorities had to be abolished. And the phrase on the lips of every Turkish school child is, ' We are all Turks'. And so they don't recognize that they have got a Kurdish population of about 12 million and the Kurds are restricted in the use of their language, they are not allowed to have TV or radio broadcasts or publications in Kurdish. It's a, you know, a very sensitive subject, and so it is something that the census takers decided to skip. Doug Franz is Istanbul Bureau Chief for the New York Times, speaking to us from Istanbul. Thank you very much, Doug. You are welcome.

The government in Ivory Coast has delayed announcing results from Sunday's Presidential election until later today. On Monday, soldiers in Abidjan, fired teargas at opposition demonstrators who tried to force their way into the National Electoral Commission building where votes were being counted. The VOA correspondent in Abidjan, says demonstrators support opposition socialist candidate Laurent Gbagbo. Early returns on Monday, showed Mr. Baghbel with a slight lead over military ruler General Robert Guei. The election is intended to restore civilian rule to Ivory Coast following a military coup in December.

The results in Sunday's presidential election were delayed without explanation Monday, and Ivoirians expressed fears that the military government was trying to manipulate the outcome. After early results Monday morning showed the junta leader, Gen. Robert Guei, trailing his main opponent by 11 percentage points, soldiers took over the offices of the National Electoral Commission. Later Monday evening, a newscaster on state television said the commission had no announcement to make. Final results were expected Tuesday. According to the official partial results announced before the blackout, Guei won 40 percent of the ballots counted, about 8 percent of total cast. But his main rival, Laurent Gbagbo, a longtime opposition leader and the leader of the smallest of Ivory Coast's three main parties, had 51 percent. A candidate would have to receive more than 50 percent of the votes to avoid a runoff. But at a news conference Monday morning, Gbagbo said he had won nearly 62 percent of the votes, compared with 26 percent for Guei. He based his announcement on his party's tallies from half of the 16,317 voting booths. ``No accident is now possible,'' said Gbagbo, who stopped short of declaring victory but sounded confident enough that hundreds of supporters began cheering and dancing in celebration. Nearby, at Guei's headquarters, the mood was subdued and there were only a few supporters when members of the military government held a news conference in the afternoon. The military government's spokesman, Capt. Henri Sama, said: ``We will win and we will win decisively. To our supporters, they can go on the streets to celebrate as well. We are confident.'' Sama criticized Gbagbo for announcing his preliminary results, saying, ``The only results that count are those of the National Electoral Commission.'' By then, however, the commission had ceased making announcements. At 5 p.m., the president of the commission, Honore Guie, said on television that a ``pause'' was necessary because results had stopped arriving from outside the cities. ``There was a rumor that I had been arrested,'' he said, ``but I am here and the results will resume at 7 p.m.'' But by late Monday evening, no further results had been announced. The delays marred what appeared to have been well-organized and fair voting on Sunday, based on the scene at voting booths and the assessments of diplomats. But according to official figures, turnout reached only about a third of the registered 5.5 million voters. Early this month, a court controlled by Guei ruled that the candidates of the country's two main parties, the Democratic Party of Ivory Coast and the Rally of the Republicans, were not qualified to run for president. That left Gbagbo as the general's only credible opponent. Protesting the court's verdict, the United States and the European Union announced they would not help finance the vote or send observers. The two major parties _ which together garnered 75 percent of the votes in the legislative election in 1995 _ called for a boycott. And the nation's largest Islamic organization told Muslims not to vote because the court had disqualified all candidates from the Muslim north, leaving five Christian southerners to contest for the presidency of a country that is 40 percent Muslim. On a continent undermined by political instability and ethnic divisions, Ivory Coast had long been a shining exception. For more than three decades after independence from France in 1960, the country was governed by the Democratic Party under Felix Houphouet-Boigny. He had little patience for political opposition but used close ties with France to turn Ivory Coast into the richest French-speaking African country. But his clumsy successor, Henri Konan Bedie, fomented an ethnocentric campaign aimed at separating true Ivoirians from so-called outsiders. Guei overthrew Bedie last December in the country's first coup.

THE SENATE: DRAFTING A GOVERNOR'S WIDOW At the time of his death in a plane crash last week, Gov. Mel Carnahan of Missouri, a Democrat, was making a strong run in his effort to unseat Sen. John Ashcroft, a Republican. So what happens next, given that Carnahan's death occurred after the deadline for putting a new name on the ballot? The race is still on. If Ashcroft wins, he wins. If Carnahan wins, the state's new governor, Roger B. Wilson, who was the lieutenant governor, will name someone to serve. Wilson is a Democrat. And he has come under considerable pressure from the state's Democratic leaders to promise to appoint Carnahan's widow, Jean, should Carnahan win. The thinking seems to be that the prospect of Mrs. Carnahan continuing her husband's work would help to carry the party to victory. Wilson has scheduled a news conference for Tuesday morning to address the issue. As for Mrs. Carnahan, she has given no indication whether she is interested in serving in the Senate. THE VOTERS: MUSLIM GROUPS BACK GORE By some estimates, there may be as many as 6 million Muslims in the United States, a relatively small population in a country of some 275 million people. But in a close presidential race, a small vote can loom large, especially when, as in the case of the Muslim vote, it is concentrated in key states like California, Michigan, Virginia and New York. Monday, an American Muslim political action committee, representing four Muslim organizations, endorsed Gov. George W. Bush, saying he had been accessible to Muslim organizations and had showed himself responsive to their concerns over sensitive issues like deportation. The PAC is a branch of the two-year-old American Muslim Political Coordinating Council, made up of the American Muslim Alliance, American Muslim Council, the Council on American-Islamic Affairs and the Muslim Public Affairs Council. Aly Abuzaakouk, the Coordinating Council's executive director, said Bush had met with American Muslim leaders last March in Austin, Texas, and in general had been ``more responsive to us than the Al Gore campaign.'' THE STATES: EMBATTLED TEXAS OFFICIAL RESIGNS The Texas commissioner of health, Dr. William R. Archer III, whose comments on race, cultural attitudes and health insurance have embarrassed his boss, George W. Bush, resigned Monday. The move came less than a week after he was placed on leave after statements about race were secretly recorded by a black female employee who had been fired. She filed a discrimination complaint. Archer's tongue also got him into trouble last spring, when he played down the importance of health insurance and blamed the state's high teen-age pregnancy rate on the cultural attitudes of Hispanics. Archer also had come under criticism for his management of the agency. TRAVEL LOG: THE NUMBERS Only two weeks left in the campaign now, and the pace is picking up, with both candidates fielding teams of surrogates (senators, governors and the like) to help. The stats from Monday: Length of official day: Gore, 12 hours; Bush, 11 hours States visited: Gore, 4; Bush, 3 Cities/towns visited: Gore, 4 (Portland, Ore.; Everett, Wash.; Spokane, Wash., and Little Rock, Ark.); Bush, 3 (Kansas City, Mo.; Des Moines, Iowa, and Milwaukee) Official Events: Gore, 3; Bush, 3 Plane Boardings: Gore, 3; Bush, 3 Miles traveled: Gore, 1,964; Bush, 1,215 Surrogates at work: Gore, 19 Democratic senators; Bush, seven groups of Republican governors Main message: Gore, prosperity is on the ballot; Bush, reforming and saving Social Security TODAY'S SCHEDULES PAT BUCHANAN: Anchorage, Alaska, and Seattle GEORGE W. BUSH: Arlington Heights, Ill.; Knoxville, Tenn., and Jacksonville, Fla. AL GORE: Little Rock, Ark., Shreveport, La., and Nashville, Tenn. RALPH NADER: Oakland, Calif., and Washington, D.C.

Missouri's new governor has decided to appoint the widow of Mel Carnahan as senator if she wants it and the late governor receives more votes than Sen. John Ashcroft in the Nov. 7 election. Two weeks before Election Day, Gov. Roger Wilson called a news conference Tuesday to announce that Mrs. Carnahan was his choice to fill the Senate vacancy that would occur under such a scenario, sources familiar with Wilson's thinking told the AP. ``Roger has settled on Jean, and the only question is whether she would accept,'' one source said. The Kansas City Star, citing unidentified party sources, also reported Tuesday that Wilson would ask Mrs. Carnahan to take the post. Mrs. Carnahan hadn't been formally approached by Wilson, at least as of late Monday. ``She has not been asked,'' the late governor's spokesman Tony Wyche said. Mrs. Carnahan was not expected to participate in the news conference, which Wilson scheduled ``discuss matters involving the U.S. Senate race.'' Mrs. Carnahan's 66-year-old husband, the Democratic governor who was challenging Republican Ashcroft for the Senate seat; their 44-year-old son, Roger; and an aide, Chris Sifford, 37, were killed Oct. 16 when their twin-engine plane crashed en route to a campaign stop. Officials have said it was legally too late to remove Mel Carnahan's name from the ballot. The tight and sometimes bitter battle with Ashcroft, a Senate freshman and himself a former governor, was seen as a key race in the Democrats' effort to retake control of the Senate. Mrs. Carnahan has not publicly discussed whether she would be available as a surrogate for her husband if Carnahan outpolls Ashcroft. But she heightened speculation while delivering a eulogy on Sunday for Sifford, urging mourners: ``Don't let the fire go out.'' In an interview with the AP on Monday, Wilson praised Mrs. Carnahan for her public composure since her husband's death, saying that ``with her display of grace under pressure, that Jean Carnahan can will herself to do whatever needs to be done to help people.'' If Carnahan receives more votes than Ashcroft, the interim senator would be appointed by Wilson after Ashcroft's term ends Jan. 3. The person would serve until Missouri's next general election in November 2002. During a St. Louis appearance Monday, Ashcroft declined to comment about the campaign or about whom Wilson might appoint. Other Democrats said Mrs. Carnahan should lead the ticket to energize party workers still devastated about her husband's death. ``Everyone is waiting for Mrs. Carnahan to say yes or no. It's her call,'' said veteran state Sen. James Mathewson, D-Sedalia and a close ally of Wilson. ``She is absolutely the first choice.'' During a St. Louis appearance Monday, Ashcroft declined to comment about the campaign. Jean Carnahan, 66, has never held public office or run for office, though she has campaigned for her husband. She has a degree in business and public administration from George Washington University. Three widows of congressmen are currently members of the U.S. House: Mary Bono, R-Calif., Lois Capps, D-Calif., and Jo Ann Emerson, R-Mo. All three first won special elections to succeed their husbands, and all three won re-election in 1998.

Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said Tuesday night that ``important progress'' had been made here in trying to persuade North Korea to ``restrain missile development and testing, as well as missile exports.'' Missile specialists from the United States and North Korea will meet next week to explore further the specific ways in which North Korea could limit its missile program, she said. In particular, a quid pro quo of shutting down the missile program in exchange for launches of North Korean satellites by foreign governments will be discussed, a senior official said. The six hours of talks between Albright and the North Korean leader, Kim Jong Il, were the first between such a high-level U.S. official and a North Korean leader. ``Everyone leaves here rather struck by the breadth and depth of the discussions,'' the senior official said. He said that was largely because the Americans had heard firsthand from Kim, the only decision-maker who counts in this country, about ``what he was prepared to do.'' The two-day visit ended on a cordial note. As a parting gift, Albright presented a basketball autographed by Michael Jordan to Kim, an ardent fan. As they said their farewells in the lobby of the guest house Tuesday, Albright encouraged Kim ``to pick up the telephone any time,'' a U.S. official said. And Kim _ the leader of one of the few countries that denies its people Internet access but who is himself a keen Internet browser with three computers in his office _ replied, ``Please give me your e-mail address.'' In explaining the headway made on the missile issue in the last two days, Albright said that Kim told her in an aside at a theatrical performance here that North Korea does not intend to make any more long-range missile launches. On her first night here, Albright was Kim's guest at a spectacle of song and dance celebrating the strengths of the country during which the image of a Taepodong missile launch was superimposed on the wall of the stadium. ``He immediately turned to me and quipped this was the first satellite launch and it would be the last,'' she said at a news conference after the two days of talks ended. In August 1998, North Korea tested a ballistic missile, the Taepodong, over Japan and threatened to launch a second test last year. Under severe pressure from the United States, North Korea agreed to a moratorium on missile testing last year and reaffirmed it this month. A quid pro quo on missile launches was proposed by Kim in July to President Vladimir Putin of Russia. The Clinton administration has been intrigued by that idea and pursued it during a recent visit of U.S. officials to Moscow. Among the details the Clinton administration is struggling with now are the extent to which the North Koreans might be prepared to abandon their missile research and development and to limit their exports of long-range missiles to such countries as Libya and Iran. One of Albright's goals on this trip was to plan for a possible visit by President Clinton, but she declined to be drawn out on whether Clinton would make the trip. She said it was up to him to make the decision. Another goal was to get to know the North Korean leader who, in his six years in office, has remained virtually unknown. Albright said that after negotiating with Kim and socializing with him at two dinners and the performance in honor of the 55th anniversary of the North Korean Communist Party, she found him a ``very good listener, a good interlocutor.'' And, she added, ``He strikes me as very decisive and very practical.'' During the talks with Kim in a government guest house here, Albright said, they discussed North Korea's human rights record. The annual human rights report by the State Department, based on interviews with refugees and defectors, paints a picture of a country that tolerates no dissent and allows no religious freedom. Her chief aide on human rights, Harold H. Koh, who is of South Korean descent, was part of the official delegation but did not participate in the formal sessions with Kim. ``The issue of human rights was raised for the first time, and we have raised it obviously by a Cabinet level person,'' Albright said. ``I think that it's obviously a subject of concern, but we have just begun our discussions on the subject. They obviously will continue.'' Albright and her aides avoided questions on what Kim had to say about the possibility of reducing tensions between North and South on the Korean peninsula. About 37,000 U.S. troops are based in the South as a deterrent to an attack from the North and its 1.1 million troops. On the possibility of North and South Korea opening liaison offices in the other's country, Albright said that while Kim was interested in having ``more informal and formal relations,'' no decision had been reached. The North Koreans went out of their way to show their friendliness toward Albright, and she acknowledged that at her news conference, saying she was shown ``exceptional hospitality,'' adding that she was impressed by the ``genuine sweetness of the children.'' Albright ended her visit here on a high note, holding a dinner for Kim at which she served California wines _ a Raymond Estates cabernet and a Morgan Monterey chardonnay _ and cross-cultural cuisine, including roast turkey and fried pigeon. Of the propaganda spectacle extolling the virtues of 55 years of communism in North Korea, Albright said she was fully aware of what she had watched. ``I have been a student of communist affairs all my life, and so one knows perfectly well how these performances are put together,'' she said. ``I just can assure that these glasses that I have on are not rose colored.''

North Korea has accepted the idea of working toward restraint in its missile program, U.S. officials said Tuesday, citing progress on a critical issue dividing the two countries as they explore reconciliation after 50 years. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright ended her historic talks with North Korean leader Kim Gong Il struck by the improbability of it all _ a cordial visit to a Stalinist land that the United States until recently called a rogue state. But both sides knew they had a long way to go to bury enmity arising from the Korean War and the vast differences between the open democracy and the closed communist regime. ``The glasses I have on are not rose colored,'' Albright said. Kim, commenting before their final meeting Tuesday, said: ``I don't think the three hours of discussions we had yesterday were enough to break the silence of 50 years.'' Albright told reporters she took seriously a remark by Kim _ delivered seemingly offhand at a gymnastic exhibition _ that his state would refrain from long-range missile launches. Kim had raised the issue when an image of a Taepo Dong I missile was flashed before the audience. ``He quipped that this was the first satellite launch and it would be the last,'' Albright said. Asked if she interpreted that as a pledge for a permanent moratorium on missile launches, Albright said, ``I take what he said as serious as to his desire to move forward to resolve various questions.'' A State Department official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said after Albright and Kim finished their talks that the North Korean leader has accepted the idea of ``serious restraint'' in missiles. Albright was going to Seoul, South Korea, on Wednesday to tell South Korean and Japanese officials about her talks with Kim. President Clinton is considering whether to visit North Korea himself, a trip that could come next month. The American delegation held a farewell dinner for Kim and his officials, serving roast turkey, beef steak and trout, with California wine. They dined in a six-sided room in the palatial Magnolia Hall, glowing with brilliant lights shining on marble _ all this in a state where many North Koreans, even near the capital, use candles and oil lamps to cope with an electricity shortage and their poverty. ``I never expected to play the role of host for such a gathering as this,'' she said, toasting Kim and remarking upon the recent moves toward a rapprochement. ``Pick up the phone anytime,'' she told Kim in farewell, giving the leader _ a basketball fan _ a ball signed by Michael Jordan. Kim replied: ``Please give me your e-mail address.'' Diplomats offered no further elaboration of Kim's words in the meetings. Lower level talks on missiles were planned for next week. Many analysts are convinced North Korea already has the capacity to strike at the perimeter of the United States with a long-range missile. That concern has been the main impetus for proposals to build a U.S. national missile defense system. North Korea already has agreed to freeze its nuclear weapons program and to stop selling missiles to regimes the United States considers hostile. ``Chairman Kim was quite clear in explaining his understanding of U.S. concerns,'' Albright said of her meetings, describing him as ``a good listener and very decisive.'' Albright said they also discussed security issues, terrorism, human rights and ``the need for concrete steps toward tension reduction on the Korean peninsula.'' ``It is important that we work to overcome the enmities of the past and focus on a brighter future for our peoples,'' Albright said. China expressed hope that the U.S.-North Korean talks would help bring stability to the Korean peninsula. ``We hope that this momentum will be maintained so that relations will be further improved,'' Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao told a news conference in Beijing. Earlier in the day, Albright ventured into the countryside for a lunch held by Jo Myong Rok, Kim's top aide, at a rural guest house. Trees along the route from the capital were ablaze with the colors of autumn. Toasting her host there, Albright said: ``The U.S. loves peace and we want to see Cold War divisions end. We want countries to feel secure from threats, conflict and war.'' In his remarks, Jo said the U.S.-North Korean relationship ``that has been frozen so deep over the past several decades is now reaching the historic moment of thawing.'' Clinton said Monday: ``We have some hope of resolving our outstanding differences with North Korea and looking forward to the day when they will truly close the last chapter in the aftermath of the Korean War.'' No other secretary of state had ventured to North Korea, nor had any other U.S. officials met Kim, who took over after his father, Kim Il Sung, commonly referred to as ``Great Leader,'' died in July 1994. The father had been in charge since 1948, before the Korean war. ___ On the Net: State Department on Korea: http://www.state.gov/www/background_notes/north_korea_0696_bgn.html

An army General has declared himself the winner of the presidential elections in Ivory Coast. General Rober Gay, the leader of the military hunter that rules the West African nation dissolved the commission that supervised the elections. Opposition leader Loron Gbagbo refused to accept the declaration. Based on results from its poll watchers Gbagbo's party had proclaimed him the winner yesterday and he reasserted that claim today. He called on Ivorians to take to the streets to support him against the hunter . Ivory Coast's two largest political parties had already boycotted the elections after the Supreme Court prevented their leaders from participating.

While the United States uses a little honey right now in Korea to sweeten relations, vinegar is on the menu for some other countries, similarly designated state sponsors of terrorism. New legislation now awaiting President Clinton's signature is designed to leave a sour taste in the mouths of leaders of several countries considered guilty of terrorist acts against the United States. The World's Katy Clark reports on a successful push to win multi-million dollar awards for American victims of political violence. Known as the Justice for Victims of Terrorism Act, the bill would allow US courts to pay compensatory damages to victims of terrorism. The money would come from sources such as assets frozen in the United States which belong to countries implicated in terrorist activities. For instance, Cuban assets frozen by the United States would be used to compensate the families of anti-Castro pilots shot down by a Cuban Mig in 1996. This is not about money, this is about punishing a terrorist country. Maggie Coey's brother was one of four men killed in that attack. She says the families will split more than fifteen million dollars. Those funds were awarded under previous legislation which allows American victims of terrorism in foreign countries to sue in US courts. We were the first families who used the Anti-terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 and we obtained the first judgement on that. However, there were no clear provisions for payment and as we tried to proceed with collection, the US government or the administration prevented us from doing so. Supposedly on the grounds that doing so would pose a national security risk, because it could antagonize terrorist nations. But as attacks against Americans are becoming increasingly common, Frank Gafney who heads the Washington DC based Center for Security Policy says the need to do something began to outweigh other concerns. This is being taken up in the context of upsurge in terrorism against Americans, not only forcing the act against USS Cole. So this is a period where, I think, clearly this kind of talk is broadly perceived on both sides of the political isle to be necessary and frankly long overdue. But Gafney says hitting terrorist nations up for compensation is an unusual and untested approach to try to curb their activities. Clearly when you're talking about people who are prepared to blow themselves up, the possibility that somebody else might pay material damages is probably not going to be upper most in their minds. But Gafney says state sponsors who fund suicide bombers do understand the language of money. And that state sponsor has reason to believe that this will translate into not only perhaps other forms of punishment but the loss of tens if not hundreds of millions of dollars. That may be a dissuasive consideration for them. The millions of dollars in compensation will not only go to the families of the Cuban-American pilots, but also to Terry Anderson who would get more than forty one million dollars in return for the nearly seven years he spent as a hostage in Lebanon. News of the bill has angered many governments abroad. Iranian officials have argued that the United States has no right to their government's money. And Cuba has threatened to cut off phone links to the United States if Washington moves to seize Cuban assets. But all this says Maggie Cooey, just goes to show that when negotiating with terrorist countries like Cuba, money talks. At the time of the last suit when they were declared guilty of murder and guilty of terrorism, they didn't care. They did not even show up in trial. Once we started the collection process they really got very upset. Terrorism is just a very cheap way of making war. So you have to go after the people who fund these actions and have them realize that they are going to have to pay. If President Clinton signs the bill in the next few days as expected, the plaintiffs would collect their money by the end of the year. For The World I'm Katy Clark.

From BBC news in London, I'm Gregor Cragey for The World. Washington has strongly condemned the military ruler of Ivory Coast, General Rober Gay. That's after Gay declared himself the victor in presidential elections. The Opposition in Ivory Coast say they are being robbed of the election. Rob Watson reports. The US has been making clear its displeasure with General Gay for weeks now, condemning his exclusion of Opposition candidates and expulsion of election observers. Now Washington has accused the General for what State Department spokesman Philip Reeca described as gross violation of democratic practice. He said the General had again violated the Constitution he had pledged to honor. The State Department is calling for the restoration of democracy in Ivory Coast, and has urged the military jauntier to respect the will of the people. Rob Watson, BBC News , Washington.

The Pentagon has confirmed that US forces in the Gulf have gone on to the highest alert status following information about a possible attack. Pentagon spokesman, Rear Admiral Craig Quigley says the move is based on intelligence of specific threats to bases in Qatar and Bahrain. He says the credibility of the threats can't be assessed but the forces must be on their guard. Given the circumstances, the recent attack on the Cole and the generally higher level of threat throughout that region, we thought it was simply the prudent thing to do to go to that higher threat condition in those two specific areas. About a thousand US personnel are in Bahrain, mainly from the Fifth Fleet, fewer than fifty are in Qatar looking after pre-positioned equipment there. The highest alert status is also still in effect in Yemen where investigations continue into the attack on the USS Cole.

This is The World, a co-production of the BBC World Service, PRI and WGBH in Boston. I'm Lisa Mullins. Gunfire echoed through the West African city of Abijan today. Soldiers in the commercial capital of Ivory Coast fired the shots to disperse mass protest against the country's military rulers. The turmoil was sparked by a government announcement today, declaring that Hunter leader General Rober Gay was the winner of Sunday's presidential elections. Opposition leader Loron Gbagbo responded by claiming that he is the real winner and urged his followers to take to the streets. Afibia Chrisdorton who reports for allafrica.com is in Abijan. She says that although there appear to be no casualties, today's clashes between the protestors and the military are unprecedented in Ivory Coast history. If you look down on to the streets of the central business district of Abijan plateau, you will see hundreds of rubber flip-flop and shoes of people who were obviously fleeing the soldiers. And I have to tell you, just before I came on air we were looking down at at least ten women who were completely nude, being stripped and beaten by the military, the sort of thing that Ivorians are simply not going to accept, which is why Laurent Gbagbo had said that his supporters must protest against what they say is a fraudulent and stolen election. When you say that the Ivorian people will not stand for this, I wonder if you can tell us what they can do about it. I mean, I'm thinking of the comparison to Yugoslavia which, of course, just a few weeks ago there was a very similar situation when there was a fraudulent election, the ruling party declared itself the winner, and then the Opposition supporters took to the streets. What would it take, Afibia, for the Ivory Coast leader to step down? It's absolutely appropriate what you said Lisa, because in his last rally Laurent Gbagbo said that if there was any sort of rigging or fraud, he wanted to see a Serbia scenario. He said, "Look what happened to Milosevic, we want to see the same thing happen here". But let me tell you that Ivorians are not used to the military being in control. It's only ten months since there has been a military government here. For forty years there has not been a soldier in control. Ivorians aren't used to this. So everything is new to them. Will they come on to the streets to demonstrate? I think the young people will. But I think there are some people who are scared. Today they have heard gunfire like they've never heard before in this city except in December when the military took over and they have heard even mortar fire which most people would associate with a coup-de-tour, not with a military leader saying he has been elected democratically. What the Ivorians, how far the Ivorians are prepared to go to, I think we'll only know in the coming days. Is there evidence that he has indeed stolen the election and is General Gay speaking for himself at all? Lisa, let me just go back a few hours. Last night we were told on television, everything is calm, everything will recommence tomorrow. We assumed that would be vote counting. When the announcement of General Gay's apparent victory at the polls was made, we were also told that electoral commission, what it had been doing, it's voting , it's counting, it's collation of votes were absolutely unusable and that they had done it in total disorder. So suddenly the very body that yesterday the Information Minister was saying was the only legitimate body that could give election results, has suddenly been absolutely thrashed by the same military government that said we must wait for them to give the results. Speaking to us from the commercial capital of Ivory Coast , Abijan, Afibia Chrisdorton, reporter for allafrica.com. Thankyou, Afibia for the update. Thankyou, Lisa.

American naval officials said on Tuesday that the destroyer Cole, at the moment of the bombing that killed 17 sailors, was at a medium-level alert, no different from that routinely in force in the Persian Gulf, despite the violence in Israel and a general warning of a possible terrorist attack on an American warship. The alert level meant there were only a handful of sailors with rifles mounting a watch on deck as the Cole entered Aden harbor, the officials said. There were no sailors manning the ship's heavy machine guns or cannons, and no American or Yemeni boats guarding the waters around the billion-dollar ship as a flotilla of service boats moved in to assist with mooring and refueling, they added. The Navy's account, given at a briefing here on Tuesday, was the most detailed so far of the security arrangements in effect on Oct. 12 when two men in a small fiberglass boat slid alongside the Cole and detonated a cargo of high explosives that blew a 40-by-40-foot hole in the hull. American officials have said the FBI has a ``working theory'' that the attack was carried out by Islamic militants who have repeatedly attacked American targets as part of a holy war against the United States, possibly inspired or directed by Osama bin Laden, an exiled Saudi financier who tops the FBI's most-wanted list. In a fresh revelation on Tuesday, Yemeni security officials confirmed that they had found a house overlooking the Aden harbor from which the conspirators appeared to have monitored previous Navy ships entering Aden for refueling and possibly watched and directed the attack. The Yemenis said investigators had found a pair of binoculars in the house, and that with these, conspirators would have been able to keep a moment-by-moment watch on the area where the Cole was moored. The officials said the house, at least the fifth one in the Aden area now identified by investigators as having been used in the attack, was empty when it was raided last weekend. FBI experts are examining it, using fingerprinting, DNA tests and other evidence-gathering techniques. The latest information appeared likely to reinforce the FBI's conclusion that the attack involved more than the two suicide bombers, that they spent weeks and possibly months preparing the attack, and that they were amply financed and technically sophisticated. The details disclosed on Tuesday about the alert level on the Cole added significantly to what the Navy had previously disclosed. The risk status in effect, known as Bravo, is the second lowest on an ascending scale; the lowest level is Alpha, and the scale ascends through Bravo, Charlie and Delta. From the outset, Navy officials had said that the Cole was at Bravo level. But the officer commanding the Navy-led force assisting the investigation, Rear Adm. Mark Fitzgerald, had first described this as the second-highest risk status, instead of the second lowest. Because Fitzgerald made this observation while saying any American ship in the region knew it was operating in ``a dangerous area,'' this seems to have been an inadvertent slip made under the pressure of dealing with the attack's aftermath. On Tuesday, Cmdr. Hal Pittman, a spokesman for the Fifth Fleet, which directs operations in the Persian Gulf area, attempted to place the facts surrounding the Cole attack in a wider perspective, rather than revising the earlier version. From the facts given by Pittman and what is now suspected about how the attack was carried out, it is still not clear that a higher alert level would have foiled the attack. Indeed, a senior Pentagon official said a higher security level might not have prevented the bombing because the little skiff would not have been perceived as a threat. In any alert status of Bravo or higher, the Cole's guards would have been authorized to open fire if it was clear an attack was under way. The Pentagon official said the Cole's captain reported that the crew believed the skiff was part of the flotilla of harbor boats helping the destroyer moor. ``In order to exercise deadly force, you have to perceive a deadly threat,'' the official said. ``The questions of whether they were right not to have perceived it as a threat will all be part of the investigation.'' On Tuesday the Cole, listing and low in the water, was on a Delta alert, and looking at it from shore suggested that this made it much less vulnerable than when it was attacked. Under awnings erected on the bow and tern, crew members were in position near machine guns and cannons, and a large inflatable picket boat, about 60 feet long and carrying two machine guns of its own, patrolled with about 15 sailors in helmets and flak jackets, back and forth along the Cole's port flank about 300 yards of the ship. Delta alerts are currently in effect for American troops and officials in Bahrain and Qatar, in the Persian Gulf, because of threats of another attack, according to Adm. Craig Quigley, a Pentagon spokesman. Navy officials have said they did not cancel the Cole's refueling stop in Aden because there had been no ``credible and specific'' threat to the vessel of the kind necessary to enforce a Delta alert. The ship's fuel tanks were still 50 percent full. The Navy has also played down the significance of two stark warnings that military and intelligence officials heard before the attack here. The first, on Sept. 22, came in a videotape apparently made by bin Laden in his hideout in Afghanistan and delivered in an unmarked envelope to Al Jazera Television in Qatar, an Arabic satellite station that bin Laden has chosen before as a conduit. On the tape bin Laden, wearing a dagger in his belt in a tribal tradition widely favored in Yemen, where his family originated, vowed to free an Egyptian Islamic leader, Sheik Omar Abdul Rahman, who was jailed for life after being convicted in New York of ordering the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center. Bin Laden, accompanied by two Egyptian militants who are thought to be among his closest aides and by Assad Allah, Rahman's son, vowed new attacks on the United States to achieve the sheik's release. ``Enough of words!'' he said. ``It is time to take action against this iniquitous and faithless force that has spread troops through Egypt, Yemen and Saudi Arabia.'' Assad Allah could be heard saying ''Forward to shed blood!'' three times. Officials in Washington have said another warning, of an impending Islamic attack on an American warship, was also received in the weeks before the Cole attack, but that risk levels were not raised because the warning did not say what kind of ship would be hit, where or when. With more than 300 ships around the globe, Navy officials here have said, this was too unspecific to have served as a basis for changing threat levels in the Persian Gulf area.

American forces in the Persian Gulf region are taking extra precautions against threats of terrorist attack, including keeping all Navy 5th Fleet ships at sea ``for the foreseeable future'' and raising the alert level of U.S. troops in the tiny Gulf states of Bahrain and Qatar. The commander in chief of U.S. Central Command, whose area of responsibility includes the Gulf, was testifying before Congress on Wednesday about the Oct. 12 bombing of the USS Cole in Aden, Yemen. The attack, believed to be the work of terrorists, has raised questions about the vulnerability of U.S. forces elsewhere in the region. Gen. Tommy Franks was to be joined at the Senate Armed Services Committee hearing by Walter Slocombe, the undersecretary of defense for policy, and Adm. Vern Clark, the chief of naval operations. The Pentagon said Tuesday that in response to specific terrorist threats against U.S. forces in Bahrain and Qatar, troops based there have been put on the highest possible state of alert. The Pentagon would not describe the nature of the threats and said it had not determined whether they were credible. ``We've got fairly specific information, but the credibility is unknown,'' Pentagon spokesman Rear Adm. Craig Quigley said. ``You're not quite sure what to make of it, so you do the cautious course of action and go up to the higher level'' of alert. The USS Cole attack, which killed 17 sailors and wounded 39, also figured in the decision to raise the alert level for troops in Bahrain and Qatar, Quigley said. U.S. officials have not yet pinpointed the culprit. The threat condition in Bahrain and Qatar was raised to ``Delta,'' the highest possible level, this past weekend, he said. Immediately after the Cole attack, all 23 ships in the Bahrain-based 5th Fleet were sent out of port to reduce their vulnerability to terrorist attack. Quigley said Tuesday that all ships _ including the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln, two cruisers, five destroyers, two frigates, one attack submarine, two mine hunters and various other assault and support ships _ will remain at sea ``for the future.'' Some of the 5th Fleet ships are in or near Aden to support the Cole, which sustained a huge hole in its hull. A destroyer, the USS Paul Hamilton, is escorting a Norwegian-owned heavy-lift ship, the Blue Marlin, as it sails from Dubai to Aden. The Blue Marlin is due in Aden on Saturday and will immediately begin preparing to take on board the 505-foot Cole for its return to the United States, Quigley said Tuesday. The two senior retired U.S. military officers chosen to head a Pentagon investigation of the security practices of the Cole _ Adm. Harold Gehman Jr. and Army Gen. William Crouch _ are making plans to travel to Aden. Quigley said they met Monday at the Pentagon with Defense Secretary William Cohen, who told them their main goal is to improve the military's ability to protect itself against terrorist attack. Quigley said the decision to raise alert levels at Bahrain and Qatar was based on intelligence reports of ``multiple threats'' from ``multiple sources.'' He said the threats were specific, but the credibility of the sources was unknown. There are fewer than 50 U.S. troops in Qatar, who manage a large stock of prepositioned Army war-fighting equipment. U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait were not included in the heightened state of alert, Quigley said. Clinton administration officials have said it is too early to consider specific plans for military retaliation for the Cole bombing, but more than enough Air Force and Navy warplanes are in the area to carry out an attack. After the terrorist bombings of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998, President Clinton ordered cruise missile strikes against suspected terrorist training camps in Afghanistan run by alleged terrorist mastermind Osama bin Laden and against a pharmaceutical plant in Sudan suspected of having links to bin Laden. ___ On the Net: U.S. Central Command: http://www.centcom.mil/ U.S. Navy 5th Fleet: http://www.centcom.mil/components/navcent_page.htm The USS Cole: http://www.spear.navy.mil/ships/ddg67/

Army members said fighting broke out Wednesday morning at Abidjan's main military base between disgruntled soldiers and loyalists to Ivory Coast's junta leader, who has declared himself winner of presidential elections. Around 3 a.m., disgruntled soldiers attacked the munitions depot at the military base known as Akouedo, two army members confirmed to Associated Press. Gunshots were heard in the surrounding suburban neighborhood. ``It's serious,'' one soldier at the base said in a brief telephone interview. It was unclear whether there were casualties. No further details were available.

thanks for joining us this morning. topping the news this half hour -- u.s. forces in the persian gulf are taking extra precautions against possible terrorist attacks. a pentagon spokesman says all of the navy's fifth fleet ships will remain at sea for the foreseeable future to reduce their vulnerability. the u.s. embassy in qatar has been closed. military personnel there and in bahrain have been placed on the highest state of alert. the pentagon says it received specific threats against u.s. possessions in the two countries. a similar threat led to the closing of the u.s. embassy in indonesia. officials say terrorist threats against u.s. interests worldwide have increased to their highest level since the millennium celebrations. the increase reportedly coincides with the october bombing of the "uss cole" in yemen, and with the recent flare-up of mideast violence. the "cole" attack killed 17 sailors and wounded 39 others. the senate armed services committee continues a hearing into the bombing today in washington.

hello from atlanta. our top story this half hour, the man responsible for u.s. forces in the persian gulf says there was no specific threat of an imminent attack in the yemeni port of aden before a bomb ripped into the "uss cole" there this month. army general tommy franks, head of the u.s. central command, today testified before the senate armed services committee to answer questions about the attack. he told lawmakers it would not trigger a u.s. retreat from the persian gulf, even though troops remain at risk to terrorism. 17 sailors were killed and dozens were injured when the explosion blew a huge hole into the hull of the navy destroyer as it was refueling in aden. franks said u.s. war ships have made almost 30 safe visits to aden since january of last year. he added the attack is already the subject of an intense investigation by many agencies. we're determined to get to the bottom of this. we'll put the events that led up to "cole" under a microscope. and, in fact, we've begun that process. we will find the facts we need to find, and we'll use the lessons that we learn from "cole" to provide the best possible force protection for our troops in one of the most dangerous regions of the world.

Junta leader Gen. Robert Guei fled Ivory Coast on Wednesday as his security forces turned against him and joined thousands of demonstrators backing opposition leader Laurent Gbagbo. Guei, who claimed Tuesday to have won Sunday's presidential vote, fled late Wednesday morning for Cotonou in nearby Benin, said Guei's former information minister Henri Cesar Sama. Airport officials in Cotonou confirmed Guei was there. Later Wednesday, Gbagbo was introduced on state television as ``president.'' Crowds of protesters exploded in celebration, beating drums and dancing in the streets of Abidjan and the western city of Gagnoa, a Gbagbo stronghold. Praising his supporters, Gbagbo thanked them for protesting Guei's ``electoral coup d'etat.'' ``I pay particular homage to those who died in the cause of this,'' he said. ``We will give them a funeral befitting their courage.'' Violence had broken out before dawn Wednesday in Ivory Coast, once considered an oasis of calm in volatile West Africa, after Guei declared himself the winner of the presidential election. Gbagbo had a slight lead when vote-counting was interrupted Monday. Early Wednesday, disgruntled soldiers attacked Guei loyalists at a munitions depot at the main military base in Abidjan, soldiers said. At least one mutineer was killed, they said. Later, thousands of Gbagbo backers swarmed Abidjan, setting up barricades, lighting bonfires and screaming for Guei's resignation. Downtown, waves of protesters advanced on soldiers who fired shots into the air and beat them down. ``We will fight until Guei is out,'' protesters at one junction chanted before fleeing gunfire. At least two people were killed and four others injured Wednesday, witnesses said. As the protests swelled, soldiers defected to join them, witnesses said. Senior junta member Capt. Saint Cyr Djikalou was among those to turn against Guei, said Sama, who also defected. ``We are taking control as I speak,'' Sama said. Pro-Gbagbo soldiers were trying to persuade remaining junta forces to put down their arms, he said. By midday, demonstrators had overrun broadcast facilities for state radio and television, and thousands more were rallying outside broadcast offices downtown, witnesses said. International radio stations found their signals blocked. Protests first broke out Tuesday when Guei dismissed the electoral commission overseeing the vote and declared himself the winner. He appeared on state-run television to thank Ivorians who he said ``like one man, in a great wave of dignity and solidarity, have just taken me to the head of the country.'' Gbagbo then called on his supporters to take to the streets. Faces blackened and hair strewn with leaves in traditional symbols of war, his backers marched toward the barricaded government offices before being stopped by soldiers who fired machine guns and tear gas. Nine people were killed and 13 badly injured in clashes in Abidjan on Tuesday, said Freedom Neruda, an official with Gbagbo's Ivorian Popular Front. The figures could not be confirmed, but witnesses said two died in violence Tuesday. The junta declared a state of emergency and instituted a nighttime curfew until Saturday. Vote counting had gone slowly from the start, and public tabulations ended Monday after only a fraction of the votes had been counted, with Gbagbo leading. Gbagbo declared victory with 59.6 percent of the vote, compared to 32.9 percent for Guei. But Tuesday, after the elections commission was dissolved, Daniel Bamba Sheik, a senior Interior Ministry official, said Guei won in the final tally with 52.7 percent of the vote to Gbagbo's 41 percent. Neither claim could be independently verified. Guei, who came to power in a December coup that was Ivory Coast's first military takeover, had promised a return to civilian rule with the elections. But the vote was plagued by controversy from the start. The nation's two largest political parties boycotted after their leaders were barred from running by the Supreme Court. Gbagbo was the only political heavyweight allowed to run. Guei's declaration Tuesday infuriated France, Ivory Coast's former colonial ruler, which has hundreds of soldiers in Abidjan. French President Jacques Chirac condemned Guei's announcement, calling it a ``coup attempt and manipulation of election results.'' ``If this doesn't end, France and the European Union must decide the consequences on their relations with current acting authorities in the Ivory Coast,'' presidential spokeswoman Catherine Colonna said, quoting Chirac.

Divers entered the wreck of the Russian submarine Kursk on Wednesday for the first time and removed the bodies of three of the 118 crewmen entombed there in one of the nation's worst naval disasters. The three bodies, placed in special containers, were lifted through a hole cut in the submarine's triple-layer hull and brought to the surface Wednesday evening, a spokesman for the navy's northern fleet command said. Forecasts of worsening weather over the Barents Sea site of the wreck, off Russia's northwest coast, left the course of the recovery operation uncertain. But the chief of staff of the northern fleet, Admiral Mikhail Motsak, indicated that the navy was determined to continue. ``One thing can be definitely said: none of the compartments will be sealed or work in them wrapped up until they have been examined by our divers in detail,'' he told Russia's RTR state television network. The bodies apparently were found in one or both of two compartments, numbers eight and nine, located farthest from the scene of two explosions that ripped open and sank the submarine on Aug. 12. As many as 10 sailors were stationed in those two compartments, and initial reports said no bodies had been found in either. That sparked speculation that the crew had survived long enough after the first explosions aboard the submarine to rush to other parts of the vessel. Information from the wreck site was sketchy Wednesday night, and it was not clear whether other bodies might remain in the two compartments. Early in the day, one Russian diver had to stop explorations after moving about 20 feet into the ninth compartment because his air hose proved too short. The retrieval of the remains, after five days of underwater planning and work, was a technical triumph for an operation that has been controversial from the start, and which even naval officials had speculated was too dangerous to carry out. President Vladimir Putin ordered the bodies retrieved and reburied after suffering a public rebuke over what many called the government's ham-handed response to the Kursk disaster. The submarine lay underwater for nearly a week after its sinking, supposedly too badly damaged for any successful rescue, before a team of Norwegian and British divers was allowed to approach it. They quickly opened a hatch and determined that everyone inside was dead. Divers are working from a drilling platform towed to the site by the Norwegian unit of Halliburton Corp., the U.S. oil-drilling services company. Halliburton workers are overseeing the operation, but only Russian divers are allowed inside the submarine. Divers used torches to cut a man-sized hole in the Kursk's hull, one of seven holes that must be carved if the recovery operation is to be completed. Military planners say they hope to raise the submarine once the recovery is complete, a task that would not be feasible until next year's summer weather. As the divers worked Wednesday, the commander of the navy, Vladimir Kuroyedov, repeated that he was confident that the Kursk had been sunk by a collision with a foreign submarine. Russian news outlets reported shortly after the disaster that debris from a foreign vessel had been spotted near the Kursk, lending credence to that theory. But a painstaking search of miles of seabed this fall turned up no such debris, and the official in charge of the Kursk recovery and investigation, deputy prime minister Ilya Klebanov, said recently that the collision theory was no more likely than any other. On Wednesday, however, Kuroyedov insisted otherwise. ``I am 80 percent sure it was a collision with another submarine,'' he said. ``In two months, I will make up the other 20 percent, and I will announce to the world who it was.'' Motsak was less direct, saying at a news conference Wednesday that it was too early to draw any conclusion about the cause of the sinking but that Kuroyedov must have grounds for his suspicions. The United States and Britain have both said that none of their ships were involved in a collision. Most experts say any impact big enough to sink the Kursk, an enormous submarine with a rubberized hull designed to withstand even torpedo attack, would have caused such severe damage that it would have been nearly impossible for an offender to escape undetected.

Yugoslavia will soon apply to join the United Nations, indicating a clear change in policy under its new president, Vojislav Kostunica, the American ambassador to the United Nations, Richard Holbrooke, said on Wednesday after meeting with Balkan leaders. ``It is clear that Yugoslavia will join the United Nations in a very short time,'' Holbrooke said. ``We are very pleased to hear that.'' Holbrooke, the first prominent member of the Clinton Cabinet to meet with Kostunica, said he had long argued over the issue of Yugoslavia's membership in the United Nations with the former president, Slobodan Milosevic, who refused to apply to join the United Nations because he insisted that his country was the sole successor to the old Yugoslavia, even after four of its republics obtained independence. Because of that, Yugoslavia's old Communist-era flag still flies outside the headquarters of the United Nations and issues of the property and liabilities of the former Yugoslavian republics remain frozen. Those countries _ Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina and Macedonia _ urged Kostunica in a joint communique on Wednesday to respect the equality of the states that emerged from the nation's breakup. The issue was just one of many that Kostunica grappled with on Wednesday, just weeks into his new job as president and still without a federal government or even a foreign minister. After his meeting with Holbrooke, he also said that he would cooperate with the United Nations war crimes tribunal in The Hague but that it was not high on his agenda. ``There is an interest for truth of events, but it is not a priority,'' he said. Kostunica said he was working on releasing 800 Kosovo Albanians being held in Serb prisons and suggested that a law granting them amnesty was a possibility. Kostunica's discussions with Holbrooke centered on the Dayton peace accords that ended the war in Bosnia, as well as on Kosovo and the U.N. resolution under which that province is now governed. Holbrooke played down any differences, saying that the changes in the way Yugoslavia is run after the departure of Milosevic would be enormous. In particular, he said, there would be an end to the subversion by Milosevic allies and Interior Ministry police. Working with Kostunica on Bosnia would be easier, one senior American official predicted, but serious differences on Kosovo remained. ``He is a nationalist and he is proud to be one,'' the official said of Kostunica. ``To a Serb nationalist, Kosovo is part of the Serbian state. But he repeatedly said he was a pragmatist, that Dayton was a part of international law and that he recognizes that the economic future for Yugoslavia lies in these things. It is encouraging.''

new information to report tonight involving the attack on the u.s.s. cole. were warned not once, but several times about a possible terrorist attack in yemen. with the latest tonight on the investigation, here's nbc news pentagon correspondent jim miklaszewski. with the damaged cole as a grim backdrop to the ongoing investigation, yemen authorities detained a carpenter who say they actually helped the terrorist load the bomb on the suicide boat at this safe house. the yemen president also claims the attackers were members of the egyptian islamic jihad with close ties to osama bin laden. while in washington today, a potential bombshell. during a congressional hearing 's revealed the national security agency, a super secret intelligence service issued a warning about a potential terrorist attack. they talked about one individual and one group which we know the name of that was deliberately going to take action against the u.s. and or israel in yemen. and a top pentagon official testifies the warning was actually, shoeed only hours before the cole was bombed. -- issued only hours before the cole was bombed. that report, as i understand it, was, in fact, disseminated some 12 hours before the explosion. a second, even more specific warning was also issued a few hours after the attack. pentagon officials still insist the flfings was too vague to prevent the cole bombing but there were apparently earlier warnings as well n. a separate hearing today, it was revealed a middle east analyst with the defense intelligence agency also warned of impending attacks then resigned in frustration the day after the cole bombing. he also warns that two or three more attacks could come in the next few weeks. the pentagon tonight says the analyst reports could not have pinpointed the cole attack. but there's a growing consensus on capitol hill that officials here should have seen this disaster coming. jim miklaszewski, nbc news, the pentagon.

The Pentagon is facing new questions about whether it could have prevented the terrorist bombing of the USS Cole in Yemen and the death of 17 sailors. A defense intelligence officer told Congress Wednesday that he warned of such attacks and resigned in protest the day after the blast. VOA's David Swan is on Capital Hill. The man is described as a counter terrorism analyst and expert on the Middle East and Persian Gulf. His name and the exact nature of the information he developed have not been disclosed, but Senators say the man felt his superiors failed to heed his warning that terrorist strikes were possible. He spent six hours before the Senate intelligence committee in a closed hearing this week. Republican Patt Roberts who announced the resignation at another committee hearing says the man's analysis may have slipped through the cracks at the Pentagon. This young man is a very, or was a very good employee and has resigned out of concern that his threat assessment basically was not considered. I don't think it was suppressed, so much as it was not considered. The defense intelligence agency has strongly denied suppressing warnings of a threat. A spokesman confirms a staffer did resign but declines to give any details. Other officials insist there was no clear sign the Cole was in danger before the apparent suicide bombing ripped The US military central command General Tommy Franks defends the decision to use the Yemeni port of Aden for refueling. He also says the attack will not drive American forces out of the Gulf. We will never reduce the risk to our people to zero, but we will reduce the risk to our people in every way we can. Our port presence in this region remains in fact a key to preserving America's vital interests. US SATCOM will not back away from this mission. Yemeni and US officials are reportedly compiling evidence of an elaborate conspiracy in the blast. The authorities are said to be scouring three safe houses in Aden. Sources are quoted as saying, investigators found bomb making material at one of them. David Swan, VOA News, Capitol Hill.

Ivory Coast's army has pledged its loyalty to opposition candidate Loran Gbagbo after violent protests against military ruler Robert Guei's claim that he won the presidential election. The army's Chief of Staff told television viewers late Wednesday, the military is at Mr. Gbagbo's disposal. Earlier Wednesday, Mr. Gbagbo claimed the presidency in an address on state run radio. He said he is forming a civilian government and thanked Ivorians for rejecting what he calls General Guei's electoral coup d'etat.

Greenhouse gases produced mainly by the burning of fossil fuels are altering the atmosphere in ways that affect earth's climate, and it is likely that they have ``contributed substantially to the observed warming over the last 50 years,'' an international panel of climate scientists has concluded. The panel said temperatures could go higher than previously predicted if emissions are not curtailed. This represents a significant shift in tone _ from couched to relatively confident _ for the panel of hundreds of scientists, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which issued two previous assessments of the research into global-warming theory, in 1995 and 1990. The conclusions are likely to resonate loudly next month when negotiators from most of the world's nations gather in The Hague to work out details of the Kyoto Protocol, a treaty intended to cut releases of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. The 1997 treaty has been signed by more than 150 countries but has not yet been ratified by any industrialized country. The panel, which operates under the auspices of the World Meteorological Organization and the U.N. Environment Program, is spelling out its new findings in a climate assessment it began working on three years ago and which fills 1,000 pages. A summary of its findings was sent this week to governments around the world for a last round of comments before the assessment is completed at a meeting in January in Shanghai, China. Given the significance of the issue and the disagreements over how to deal with it, there are likely to be changes before the summary and the 14 chapters of research underlying it go to print sometime next year, several scientists involved in the project said. A copy of the summary was obtained by The New York Times from someone who was eager to have the findings disseminated before the meetings in The Hague. Many panel members said the summary represented the closest thing to a consensus possible in science, which is generally driven more by questioning and challenges than by esprit de corps. In interviews, several members of the panel declined to discuss details of the report or the summary, saying they were not yet in their final form. But they said recent advances in the study of climate change had led them to see with greater clarity the role of people in climate change. For example, they pointed to additional temperature data gathered in the last few years, which have been substantially warmer than any similar string of years in many centuries; to improvements in computer models designed to project future trends; and to better understanding of the influence of other climate-influencing emissions, like particles of sulfates that can cool the earth by reflecting sunlight back into space. Meanwhile, they said in interviews and in the summary, evidence of increasing warming has shown up in retreating glaciers, thinning polar sea ice, retreating snowpacks, warmer nights and elsewhere. ``More and more people working in atmospheric science or on climate or ecology have had to come to grips with the fact that climate change is affecting what they're looking at,'' said Kevin E. Trenberth, the head of the climate analysis division of the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo., and a lead author of the panel's summary. ``There is increasing evidence from many sources that the signal of human influence on climate has emerged from natural variability, sometime around 1980.'' The report's language is far more constrained than that, reflecting a delicate consensus that was reached only after months of debate and several rounds of comments by hundreds of scientists and government climate experts, Trenberth said. One of its most striking findings is its conclusion that the upper range of warming over the next 100 years could be even higher than it estimated in 1995, in a worst case raising the average global temperature 11 degrees Fahrenheit from where it was in 1990. By comparison, average temperatures today are only 9 degrees warmer than they were at the end of the last ice age. In its 1995 analysis, the panel concluded that a worst-case scenario would raise temperatures 6.3 degrees. The worsening of the picture is due to a projected cleansing of the atmosphere in coming decades of other emissions from fuel burning that have a cooling influence on climate _ specifically the veil of tiny particles of sulfates from unfiltered burning of coal and oil that contribute to smog and acid rain. In the last century, these sun-blocking particles probably masked substantial warming, scientists say. If they are increasingly removed as more smokestacks and tailpipes are filtered around the world, the warming from carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases would not be counteracted, the report concludes. Not everyone is satisfied with the document or the process that produced it. Richard S. Lindzen, a climate expert at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who has been a prominent dissenter from the view that human activity is altering climate, helped write one chapter of the assessment but is skeptical about the importance of the human contribution to any future warming. He described the summary as ``waffle words designed for one thing, to ensure that the issue remains important enough that it not be put on a back burner.'' Overall, he said, there is little solid evidence that any climate change would have harmful effects. Still, even Lindzen said he believed that the human influence on the earth's climate was now established. ``There has to be a human component to the change that's under way,'' he said. The summary itself acknowledged the need for much more research, but also laid out many potentially dire consequences if the warming takes even a middle course. Even if emissions of carbon dioxide and the other gases are sharply reduced, it said, ``sea level will continue to rise due to thermal expansion for hundreds of years.'' Michael Oppenheimer, a climate scientist at Environmental Defense, a private environmental group and one of the authors of the summary, said it represented a balanced, sober assessment of the risks ahead. Other scientists involved in the assessment pointed out that the authors of the summary also included Mack McFarland, an atmospheric scientist at a division of DuPont, and several other experts approaching the question from the industry point of view. Together, they concluded that the nuanced language of 1995, which said, ``The balance of evidence suggests a discernible human influence on global climate,'' was clearly out of date.

Nearly two dozen sailors survived the powerful explosions that ripped through the nuclear submarine Kursk, a note found in one seaman's pocket showed Thursday. But it was not clear how long the 23 seamen stayed alive after the blasts tore apart the submarine and sank it in the Barents Sea, killing all 118 men aboard. And it provided no clues to the cause of the August catastrophe. The note turned up in the pocket of a seaman identified as Lt. Dmitry Kolesnikov, commander of the Kursk's turbine section, Russian Navy chief Adm. Vladimir Kuroyedov said. His was among the first four bodies retrieved Wednesday. ``All the crew from the sixth, seventh and eighth compartments went over to the ninth. There are 23 people here. We made this decision as a result of the accident. None of us can get to the surface,'' Kuroyedov quoted the note as saying, according to the ITAR-Tass news agency. The note was written between 1:34 p.m. and 3:15 p.m. local time Aug. 12, the day of the disaster, said Vice Adm. Mikhail Motsak, chief of staff of the Northern Fleet. Foreign and Russian ships in the area registered two powerful explosions around 11:30 a.m. The note ``also said that two or three people might try to escape the submarine through the emergency escape hatch located in the ninth compartment,'' Motsak said. Water that gradually flooded the ninth compartment could have thwarted that escape attempt, he said. After the Kursk sank, Russian submersibles were unable to latch onto the hatch, but Norwegian divers who followed managed to open it a week after the tragedy and determined that there were no survivors. The question remained whether they might have been saved if Russia hadn't waited for days before accepting foreign aid. But Deputy Prime Minister Ilya Klebanov quickly denied Thursday that there was any possibility they could be rescued. The crewmen had some chance of getting out on their own through the escape hatch but apparently didn't do that because of injuries, Igor Spassky, head of the Rubin design bureau that developed the Kursk, said Thursday. Kolesnikov's note went on to mention the figures 13 and five, without explanation, and then added: ``I am writing blindly,'' Kuroyedov told families of the crew gathered in the Arctic port of Murmansk. The rest of the note was private, Motsak said. Many Russian officials had said some crew members could have remained alive after the explosions, as indicated by reports of tapping sounds detected from the submarine in the first days. But others discounted the reports as unsubstantiated and said the sounds could have been caused by collapsing equipment or the submarine settling into the seabed. The survivors of the initial explosions, which were minutes apart, probably died of drowning, hypothermia or high pressure. Kolesnikov, a 27-year-old son of a submariner from St. Petersburg, was the only seaman to have been identified so far, admirals said. Russian and Norwegian divers recovered the first bodies Wednesday after five days of painstaking work to cut holes in the top of the submarine. After the note was discovered, divers concentrated on the ninth compartment but were hampered by rough waters. Divers may cut a hole in that compartment to facilitate the search, Motsak said. Officials hope to fly the recovered bodies Saturday to Severomorsk, the main base of the Northern Fleet, for a memorial ceremony if weather permits, he said. Up to two-thirds of the crew were likely blown to bits by powerful explosions in the weapons room in the submarine's bow, officials said. The Kursk's nuclear reactors were automatically shut down, and there has been no radiation leak. The reactors were ``behaving ideally,'' Spassky said Thursday. Kuroyedov had warned that he might cancel the recovery effort if experts ruled that divers' lives were in danger. But President Vladimir Putin promised to recover the bodies at an emotional meeting with the crew's relatives shortly after the disaster, and the government seemed bent on conducting the costly effort despite the shortage of funds for the military. Some Russian media have pointed out that by stubbornly conducting the risky effort, the government sought to redeem itself for the confused response to the sinking of the Kursk, when it resisted foreign help for days while botching its own rescue efforts. The cause of the disaster remains unknown, with authorities suggesting a collision with a Western submarine or World War II-era mine or to an internal malfunction.

Divers probing the wreck of the Russian submarine Kursk recovered a chilling note scrawled as the vessel lay crippled on the sea floor last August, an indication that at least 23 crewmen survived for hours after two explosions sank the sub. The disclosure refuted the assurances of senior military officials that the Kursk's entire crew had most likely died within minutes of the explosions, which ripped open the hull during a naval exercise in the Barents Sea. And the note instantly reignited a national debate over whether the military's attempt to rescue the sailors was fatally flawed as well. It also raised the prospect that divers will find more notes _ perhaps containing evidence as to why the sub exploded and sank _ when and if the bodies of other survivors are recovered. The head of the Russian Navy's northern fleet, Vice Adm. Mikhail Motsak, said the note was found in the pocket of Lt. Capt. Dimitri Kolesnikov, 27, one of four sailors whose bodies have been retrieved since the recovery work began last Saturday. Kolesnikov ran the sub's turbine room. Motsak refused to release the entire note, which he said contained a very private farewell message to the captain's family. But an excerpt printed by the semi-official Itar-Tass news agency offered a gripping, if brief, glimpse of the situation aboard the doomed vessel as it lay 300 feet below the ocean surface, its corridors pitch-black and increasingly cold. ``I am writing blind. It's 13:15,'' wrote Kolesnikov, using the military-time equivalent of 1:15 p.m. ``All personnel from sections six, seven and eight have moved to section nine. There are 23 people here. ``We have made this decision because none of us can escape.'' Motsak said the note indicates that two or three crewmen tried to flee the submarine through a specially built escape hatch in that ninth compartment. Russian subs are equipped with suits designed to protect sailors during such underwater escapes. ``As we know, that attempt failed,'' he said, ``maybe because it was filled with water.'' Norwegian divers who opened that escape hatch on Aug. 21 _ until this week, the first successful effort to penetrate the sub _ found that the airlock was filled with water. Motsak said Kolesnikov had written his message between 1:34 p.m. and 3:15 p.m. on Aug. 12, the day of the blast. That suggested that at a minimum, the crewmen survived nearly four hours after the two explosions that breached the Kursk. American intelligence vessels and a seismic institute in Norway recorded a first blast at about 11:27 a.m., and a second, far bigger, one 2 minutes and 15 seconds later, at 11:30 a.m. There was no explanation of why the Itar-Tass version of the note stated that it was written at 1:15 p.m., while Motsak had a different interpretation. Kolesnikov's message suggests that nearly everyone in the aft portion of the submarine initially survived the explosions, which devastated the two fore compartments housing torpedoes and the sub's command post. The Kursk's published crew roster states that 24 sailors were assigned to compartments six through nine, one more than the 23 mentioned in the captain's note. Efforts by the Russian military, and later foreign divers, to rescue the crew captured the attention of Russia and the world for several days. The military alternately reported hearing tapping sounds from the hull that may have been a signal from the sailors inside with the theory that all the sailors must have died immediately. Estimates on the available air inside varied wildly. The Russian people criticized the military for its handling of the accident. The first official announcements came two days after the vessel plunged to the bottom of the Barents Sea, and help from Britain and Norway was not accepted until four days after the sinking. The accident also damaged the reputation of Putin who was criticized for not going to the scene of the accident, and instead remaining on vacation at a Black Sea resort. Rebuked by the public for his slow response and the military's inability to mount an effective rescue, Putin ordered the bodies of the Kursk sailors retrieved and buried.

Officially, on their state-controlled television stations and in their newspapers, many Arab governments have turned down the volume this week on the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. But the tone _ one of unalloyed hostility toward Israel, deep distrust of American policy and certitude that the very survival of Muslim shrines in Jerusalem is at stake _ has remained as vigorous as it has been since the deadly clashes began almost a month ago. While the militant tone has been driven by the state media, it also mirrored the flood of public sympathy and political activity in support of the Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Long a distant and sometimes bothersome distraction for ordinary people in Arab countries, the Palestinian issue has become a daily fixation and a rallying point for a revival of pan-Arab nationalism, which had been dormant for decades. The fevered programming on nearly all Arab radio and television stations that began with the outbreak of violence at the end of September has eased off in the last few days. Archival film of Arab soldiers fighting Israelis in past wars is now only occasionally shown and even the old military songs from previous Arab-Israeli wars have largely disappeared. But reminders of the current conflict are everywhere, stirring a sense of solidarity, and if the grass-roots anger against Israel and its allies can be sustained, even at a low level, the impact on regional politics could be substantial. Although they show no signs of wanting to reach out to Israel now, for example, Arab leaders might find it difficult to do so in the future. Attitudes toward the United States and American businesses in the region could also be permanently affected. In Jordan this week, the government ordered each of its 160,000 civil servants to donate one day's pay to a fund for what it called the Palestinian intifada, or uprising. In Egypt, many private companies and several government ministries have asked their workers to do the same. The Arab League conference in Cairo, which ended Sunday, had recommended that all Arabs give up a day's salary for the cause. It was a popular move, prompting the London-based Arabic newspaper Asharq al Awsat to describe the recommendation as ``a qualitative leap in cooperation between rulers and ruled in support of a cause, a cause which it is natural for citizens to view with zeal, and leaders to view with a measure of foresight and caution.'' The bloodshed in the Palestinian territories is still the leading news item in the region. Jordanian newspapers, serving a readership that has close family and business ties with Palestinians in the West Bank, print the names of every Palestinian casualty. Egyptian state radio has reduced but not eliminated its frequent broadcasts of old songs calling on Arabs to fight to recover Jerusalem from Israel. In Kuwait, the photographs of every Palestinian brought to hospitals in the country this week have been put on the front pages. Commentators have started using bluntly anti-Jewish language in articles about Israel. Arabic-language all-news satellite television stations have also continued to provide a platform for many of the most radical anti-Israel groups, which had only limited access to pan-Arab audiences before the clashes. Hezbollah, the Lebanese-based Islamic group that has called for war to drive Israel from the West Bank and Gaza Strip, also took a leap in its own propaganda campaign when it arranged recently to have its television station broadcast 24 hours a day on Arab satellite networks. The filmed death of Muhammad al-Durra, the 12-year-old Palestinian boy who was shot by Israeli soldiers in Gaza as he cowered next to his father, remains a staple image in the news media and on Arabic Internet sites. But in Cairo, unsolicited messages have also been showing up on mobile telephones urging people to boycott American products and businesses. ``We need your help to stop the murder of Palestinian women and children,'' the message reads. ``Muhammad al-Durra! Allahu al Akbar.'' Leaflets and ads appealing to consumers to boycott American products and restaurants have popped up in many Arab countries. It is not clear that they have been followed in any organized fashion, but business people have expressed concern. ``I think all our members are worried a lot,'' said Hisham Fahmy, executive director of the American Chamber of Commerce in Egypt, which has set up a committee to assess the impact of the boycott movement. The tension in the region, heightened by the bombing of the destroyer Cole in Yemen and the orders to American forces in the Persian Gulf to go on high alert, has prompted some companies to take precautions to protect their American employees. The Philip Morris company in Egypt told its non-Egyptian staff to evacuate their dependents at the start of the Palestinian-Israeli clashes and has not yet suggested they come back. Apart from the continuing violence between Palestinians and Israelis, news events of the coming weeks are likely to keep the public mood inflamed. Next month, Arab leaders are to join their counterparts from Muslim nations around the world in the Persian Gulf state of Qatar for a meeting of the Organization of the Islamic Conference. The disputed status of Jerusalem, the sensitive issue that helped provoke the recent violence, is expected to take center stage. Saudi Arabia, which founded the organization, has already portrayed the clashes as a battle to save the Islamic holy sites in Jerusalem and has accused Israel of plotting to destroy them. A prominent force at the Nov. 12 conference also will be Iran, which has been especially virulent in its anti-Israeli commentary lately and this week gave a hero's welcome to seven wounded Palestinians who were flown to Tehran for medical treatment.

A day after toppling the military dictator in a popular uprising, residents of Ivory Coast furiously turned against one another Thursday, and the deadly clashes quickly took on religious and ethnic overtones and spread to smaller cities. Supporters of two of the main political parties, unified the day before in their opposition to the officer, Gen. Robert Guei, were thrust apart Thursday by religion, ethnicity and their leaders' ambitions. The winner of Sunday's disputed election, Laurent Gbagbo, was sworn in as president Thursday afternoon in the presidential palace. Gbagbo, who has the backing of the security forces, said he would not hold a new election despite calls to do so from the country's two other major parties, the United Nations, the United States and the Organization for African Unity. ``I extend my hand to everyone,'' he said after the inauguration, adding that he would form a government of national unity as early as Friday. But Alassane D. Ouattara, a former prime minister who was barred from running in the election and is insisting on a new vote, took refuge in the German ambassador's residence Thursday morning after security forces surrounded his house and fired tear gas and ammunition. The attack was led by supporters of Gbagbo and backed by paramilitary gendarmes in two vehicles, according to Ouattara's supporters and other witnesses. A motley group of Ouattara's own security forces _ including armed guards, traditional hunters known as dozos and young men carrying machetes, molotov cocktails and rocks _ guarded the house after he fled. ``Look at what they tried to do the house this morning,'' said Ali Coulibaly, a spokesman for Ouattara, rejecting the idea that his party could work with Gbagbo. ``We can't tell the difference now between the security forces and Gbagbo's party. Look at the way Gbagbo seized power today.'' Elsewhere in Abidjan, dozens of people were reported killed, pushing the death toll over three days to nearly 90. Only a day earlier, euphoria had swept the country after tens of thousands of Ivoirians descended on the city center and, in scenes that recalled the popular revolt against Slobodan Milosevic in Yugoslavia but were new to Africa, overthrew Guei. The general, who had declared himself winner of the election after canceling the count, fled Abidjan, though his whereabouts were still unclear Thursday night. Immediately after the general's downfall, Gbagbo declared himself president, called for national reconciliation and lifted the state of emergency and curfew. But Thursday night, after it became clear that Ouattara's supporters were unwilling to accept Gbagbo's terms, the state of emergency and the curfew were reimposed. Thursday supporters of both men fought one another with machetes and clubs, and mosques and churches were attacked in clashes that have increasingly taken an ethnic and religious cast in a country that until recent years was an unusual model of unity in Africa. Guei and the unpopular president he overthrew last year, Henri Konan Bedie, had each tried to exploit the ethnic and religious divisions to their advantage, and hence inflamed them. A court controlled by the general excluded Ouattara, a Muslim, from the vote Sunday, provoking a boycott by his party and many Muslims, who make up 40 percent of the population in this West African nation. The court also barred the Democratic Party of the Ivory Coast, which had governed the country for most of its post-independence history. In the face of many Muslims' calls for a new election, supporters of Gbagbo, who like 30 percent of the population is Christian, have vented their anger. Gbagbo's supporters and their gendarme backers seemed to overwhelm Ouattara's supporters, who began the day with vast demonstrations, and most of those killed Thursday were Muslims. In Abobo, a sprawling working-class neighborhood that suffered the heaviest violence, three mosques were attacked and half a dozen people were reported dead. The neighborhood remained on edge after the morning's riots, with fires smoldering on deserted streets. At one mosque, the imam, Traore Yaya, nervously answered the door when a reporter knocked Thursday morning. Muslims who live on the block came quietly out of their houses as Yaya showed two palm-sized tear-gas canisters. ``We were praying on the street in front of the mosque when gendarmes came by and threw tear gas at us,'' he said. A jeep filled with gendarmes suddenly passed as he was talking, and the crowd scattered. On a main street not far away, where a wounded old woman was trying to find help, Muslims also said that the gendarmes had backed Gbagbo's supporters. ``All the gendarmes we saw were from one ethnic group _ Gbagbo's,'' said Sekou Kone, a 35-year-old merchant, who had been hiding inside his shop. ``This means we are heading into a civil war. ``Since the general is gone, the people must now have fair elections. One third of the Ivoirian population cannot choose a president,'' a reference to the 37 percent turnout. By Thursday night the violence appeared to have died down after two high-ranking officials from Ouattara's and Gbagbo's parties appeared together on state television and urged their followers to stop fighting. They announced that the two political leaders would meet, though they did not say when. The call for a new election was endorsed by several prominent outsiders, including Kofi Annan, secretary-general of the United Nations; Thabo Mbeki, the president of South Africa; and Gnassingbe Eyadema, the president of Togo and the current head of the Organization for African Unity. The United States echoed these calls. ``It's going to be very important for the voices of the disenfranchised Ivoirians to be heard and, in that sense, the holding of free, fair and inclusive elections will be needed,'' said Philip Reeker, a State Department spokesman. Significantly, however, France, the former colonial power and the biggest foreign powerbroker in the Ivory Coast, said it was satisfied with the results of Sunday's election and called for legislative elections to be held as scheduled in December. Gbagbo, a socialist, has close ties with the Socialist Party in France. According to the final results of the National Electoral Commission, which General Guei dissolved after preliminary figures showed he was trailing, Gbagbo received 59 percent of the votes, compared with 33 percent for the general. Because of the boycott, only 2 million voted in this country of 15 million people. Voting was especially light in the Muslim north. In addition to Ouattara's call for a boycott, the largest Islamic organization told Muslims to stay home. The Ivory Coast was for decades an African anomaly: a country where people of different religions and ethnic groups co-existed peacefully, under policies enacted by President Felix Houphouet-Boigny, who led the country for three decades. But Bedie, who became president after Houphouet-Boigny died in 1993, stirred up xenophobia aimed at Muslim northerners in an attempt to sideline his main rival, Ouattara, who was deputy managing director of the International Monetary Fund until last year. As Bedie spoke of ``pure Ivoirians'' and ``foreigners,'' northerners and immigrants became targets of the authorities. Among ordinary Ivoirians, the cleavages widened between Muslims and Christians. Guei, who seized power last year, adopted a similar anti-northern position. What is more, Gbagbo, who had been allied with Ouattara, broke off their union and also inserted ethnocentric and xenophobic language in his political messages.

But today's top story takes us to Ivory Coast where supporters of Orano Gbagbo continue to clash with followers of Alassane Ouattara. Gbagbo is the man whose electoral victory helped chase a military ruler from power and possibly from the country. Ouattara is the man, one of several actually, who was barred from running. The World's Katy Clark has her story. Ivory Coast's National Electoral Commission announced today that Gbagbo had received more than 59% of the votes cast Sunday against former military leader General Robert Guei but that does not settle the question of who is the rightful president of the West African nation. One prominent opposition leader Alassane Ouattara was barred from competing in the campaign. Today, he denounced the election as "corrupt and unfair". The process was completely manipulated by President Gay who through the judicial process eliminated the main candidates, myself and the candidates of the PDCI, the former ruling party and there were circumstances, turn out was around 20%, which mean that 80% of the people, of the voters, abstained. Since the election it seems that almost as many people have taken to the streets in protest. First of Gay's claim to victory and then of Gbagbo's rise to power. Today, the mainly Christian backers of President elect Gbagbo and a largely Muslim supporters of Ouattara overturned cars and attacked churches and mosques in the commercial capital Abidjan and at least 20 people were killed. Francois Rivasseau of the French foreign ministry says, Sunday's election should have resolved the question of who holds power in the nation. We have no doubts about the result and we are pretty sure about the decision and work of the Electoral Commissioner. Mr. Gbagbo will be assigned as the next president but it's not up to us to say so. It's upto the citizens of Ivory Coast. But many of those citizens are furious. In response to their angry demonstrations, Ivory Coast chief of defense declared today security forces will shoot on sight anyone who breaks an overnight curfew. Concerned about the continued tumult, the organization of African Unity today called for an emergency meeting. Gale Smith, a special assistant to President Clinton on African affairs says, the White House is also taking a keen interest in the situation doing what it can to end the violence. The most important thing at present, that we and others are doing is prevailing upon all the key political activists to call for calm. The tendency of each of them is to say "its not my fault, it's the other guy's fault". The bottom line here is that they all need to line up behind calming the situation before it spins any further out of control. Smith says the political upheaval didn't come as a surprise. There were hints of unrest last fall when General Gay staged a military coup, the first ever in a once peaceful Ivory Coast. We have been prevailing upon General Gay and others as have countries in the region that the course he was on, was going to lead to instability and potential violence. He was not prepared to listen and I think what we are seeing now is the outgrowth of the great manipulation of the political system and now we have got a number of forces vying for power. And it couldn't come at a worst time and place. Smith says Ivory Coast had been a source of stability in a volatile region. The White House, she adds is placing a high priority on containing the turmoil in Ivory Coast, lest it spread to its West African neighbors. For The World, I'm Katy Clark.

From BBC News in London, I'm James Cawling for the World. The West African state of Ivory Coast has a new president. Veteran opposition leader Laurent Gbagbo has been sworn in just one day after the country's military ruler was ousted by a popular revolt. But violent clashes continue today as rival political factions continue to dispute the outcome of last Sunday's presidential election. The clashes are between the new president's followers and the supporters of a former Prime Minister Alassane Ouattara. Ouattara is demanding new elections. In most of the major cities, the turnout was not more than 20 percent, so this cannot be called a popular election. Ivory Coast deserves a president democratically elected. But Backbo supporters strongly reject the idea of re-running the elections. One of Backbo's most senior advisors Philip Jangonibi says new elections are out of the question. No, no we cannot accept a new election and we cannot accept to see the country burn. It is those who are demonstrating now who want the country to be burnt. And we don't want that. At least 20 people are known to have been killed in today's violence. Unrest has reportedly spread to other cities outside Abidjan.

I'm Dave Deforest, VOA News. Ivory Coast's newly elected President Loran Gbagbo plans to announce his government today, one day after being sworn in amid more deadly violence in the country. Mr Gbagbo has ruled out new elections but is promising to set up what he calls a broad-based government of national unity. New violence broke out Thursday between Gbagbo supporters and backers of rival opposition leader Alisan Ouattara, who was barred from Sunday's voting. The latest violence has killed 20 people. Some of the victims were burnt to death. A state of emergency and a nighttime curfew are in effect until Saturday. US State Department spokesman Philip Reicher called on the leaders of the various factions to insist that their supporters avoid violence. So they all have a fundamental responsibility to control their supporters and ensure that the violence doesn't spread and we are urging them to speak out, all the leaders, to speak out and urge their supporters to forsake violence. Philip Reicher.

And right now let's get the latest world news. I am David Coller, VOA News. Ivory Coast's newly elected President Loran Gbagbo plans to announce his government today. Mr. Gbagbo has ruled out new elections, but is promising to set up what he calls a broad-based government of national unity. In Washington State Department Spokesman, Phil Reeker said new elections are necessary. The election October 22nd was failed and fundamentally flawed from the outset due to the exclusion of major party candidates and other machinations leading up to the election. It's going to be very important for the voices of the dissent franchise Ivorians to be heard and in that sense the holding of free, fair and inclusive elections will be needed to fully restore the government or put to fore its legitimacy and bring democracy back to . Fresh violence broke out Thursday between the Gbagbo supporters and backers of rival opposition leader Alassane Ouattara, who was barred from Sunday's voting. At least 20 people were killed.

It is impossible for any outsider to know exactly why North Korea has changed its tack so dramatically in recent months, inviting old enemies from South Korea and the United States to Pyongyang and toasting them lavishly. But it was clear on Monday that the North Korean leader, Kim Jong Il, had impressed his long-skeptical guests as someone Washington could work with when, during one of his country's massively choreographed extravaganzas, he made a quip to Secretary of State Madeleine Albright about cooperation on missiles. The reasons guessed at for North Korea's campaign range from sheer distress because of repeated famines and a collapsing economy, to a push from the country's Chinese benefactors, who are eager to remove North Korea and its weapons programs from Washington's list of justifications for developing high-tech missile shields. But for all the attention to the reception given to Albright, this week's scenes of conciliation and good cheer were merely the latest in a gradually accelerating transformation that has been under way for at least a year. North Korea has been on a diplomatic blitz for a full year now, establishing or planning relations with Britain, Canada, Australia, Italy, France and others. ``Meeting with North Korean officials used to be like watching a man try to cross a river by feeling the rocks under his feet one by one,'' said a diplomat from one of these countries. ``The only thing is that whenever the North Koreans reached a rock, you could never be sure they wanted to proceed any further.'' ``Nowadays,'' the diplomat said, ``you walk into a meeting with them for the first time, and before you can even get acquainted, they are saying, `Great, how quickly can we establish relations.''' The cynical view of this diplomatic offensive is that it merely seeks to collect as much international aid as possible for Pyongyang, while diversifying the sources. Just as surely, though, these new engagements will quickly increase the exposure of people inside the world's most reclusive nation to outsiders and their influences _ a risky proposition, which perhaps explains why such an opening has not been tried before. In a system like North Korea's, in which power is highly concentrated and closely held, that such changes are taking place certainly reflects decisions made at the summit of power. But it is just as clear that few of the changes have been explained to people from the upper-middle level of the bureaucracy on down. Now, suddenly, people in a nation that, with China's help, fought the United States to a standstill in the Korean War, and have been told all their lives that Americans are wolves, are seeing their leaders making merry with the enemy. ``Why are people suddenly so cooperative?'' said one Western diplomat whose country is planning to open relations soon with Pyongyang. ``Because they know the instructions have come from the chairman to smile and get as much help from the outside as possible, and they know they'd better not fail. But boy are they confused.'' The confusion theme was repeated by almost every Westerner with extensive experience in North Korea. ``Decisions in a pyramidal society like this are so centralized, so political and so personal, that it is hard for Americans to understand that kind of pressure,'' said Peter Hayes, co-executive director of the Nautilus Institute, a private aid group that has been active in the country for years. ``Many people are confused,'' Hayes said. ``They don't know what the new edicts from the top mean. Those at the top might not even know. They are striking out in a completely new direction, and they are going to have to make it up as they go along.'' But frequent visitors say that given the sheer weight of the country's totalitarian ideology and generations of mass indoctrination, changing this country's course will be something akin to turning a huge ship at sea. Opening North Korea up, even modestly, and exposing people to the idea that Westerners _ and South Koreans _ are not devils, alone represents an extraordinary change. It also represents a fantastic gambit. The foremost task now for Kim is to make sure that the change does not become revolutionary, as his people begin to get a clearer idea of the deprivation they have suffered, especially relative to their neighbors. ``This is a society that has been focused most of all on stability, and they have been guided all along by a stable ideology,'' said one international aid worker who has visited the country often. ``If you talk to officials there now, though, suddenly they feel like they are being carried along by a wave, and to say the least, they are perplexed.''

WASHINGTON (AP) _ U.S. law enforcement and intelligence officials investigating the bombing of the USS Cole are searching for links to Islamic militant Osama bin Laden but so far have found no hard evidence, American officials said Friday. Asked whether a clear link has been established, FBI spokesman Jim Margolin said, ``That's an obvious question that's being looked into. We're not confirming such a link exists.'' Margolin said the FBI would not comment further. A senior U.S. intelligence official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Friday that while bin Laden, a Saudi who lives in Afghanistan, is a likely suspect, the investigation has not yet established firmly that he financed the operation or supervised it. ``There are no conclusions made at this point'' about who is behind the bombing, which killed 17 U.S. sailors and wounded 39, he said. Meantime, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and FBI Director Louis Freeh appealed in a joint statement for greater cooperation from the Yemenis in the investigation, because FBI agents have encountered the same problem they had in an earlier terrorism investigation in Saudi Arabia _ no direct access to suspects. The FBI, working with Yemeni authorities in the port of Aden, has completed examining the ship and various locations in Yemen for physical evidence, Albright and Freeh said. They did not identify the locations, but officials have said they include several houses thought to have been used to prepare the attack. Albright and Freeh confirmed that FBI evidence teams, laboratory examiners and bomb technicians have been returning home. Officials have said more than 20 agents remain, including investigators, security and communication specialists. Albright and Freeh praised Yemeni cooperation during the searches, in which FBI specialists had full access to the sites and returned key evidence to Washington for detailed lab tests. But they sought more access now. ``The next critical phase will require Yemeni and U.S. personnel to work as partners in the collection of information and participants in the interview process of witnesses,'' Albright and Freeh said. ``We count on President Saleh's commitment of full cooperation.'' FBI officials have privately complained that they have not been able to participate in Yemeni interviews with witnesses or suspects so far. Freeh visited Yemen personally to push for that access. Similar trips by Freeh to Saudi Arabia after a 1996 truck bomb attack on the Khobar Towers complex housing killed 19 U.S. airmen failed to win his agents the ability to directly participate in suspect interviews there. Bin Laden, the son of a billionaire Saudi Arabian family, is frequently mentioned as a possible suspect. He is on the FBI's list of 10 most-wanted fugitives; he is wanted in connection with the Aug. 7, 1998, bombing of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, which killed more than 200 people, including 12 Americans. The Pentagon has declined to comment on the Cole bombing investigation. Defense Secretary William Cohen and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff are urging military commanders use the USS Cole bombing as an impetus for strengthening anti-terrorist protections for their troops. As Cohen and Gen. Henry H. Shelton made that plea Thursday in a video teleconference with commanders and other top military leaders, the co-directors of a special commission investigating the Cole bombing headed to Yemen ``to look for themselves'' at the situation, Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon said. Bacon declined to provide any details on the schedule of retired Adm. Harold Gehman and retired Army Gen. William Crouch, whom Cohen appointed to find ``force protection'' lessons in the Cole attack. The Gehman-Crouch commission's work is separate from the FBI's investigation, which is aimed at determining who committed the crime. In light of the Cole tragedy and reports of additional terrorist plots against American military targets, Cohen and Shelton used Thursday's video teleconference to emphasize to U.S. commanders the urgency of shoring up any weaknesses in security protection plans. ``The goal basically was to make a good system better, and to use the concern that has been generated by the attack against the Cole as an opportunity for all commanders in chief to make sure that they are reviewing their force protection postures and their procedures, to make sure that they are making any necessary changes,'' Bacon said. The Cole was attacked by suicide terrorist bombers during a refueling stop Oct. 12 in the Yemeni port of Aden. Two men in a small boat edged up to the 505-foot Cole at a fueling dock in the harbor and detonated a package of explosives, blowing a hole 40 feet high and 40 feet wide in the ship's steel hull. One question that has arisen in the aftermath is whether Navy ships should have more or better-trained security aboard. The private Pentagon conference, which lasted a little over an hour, included the heads of the U.S. regional commands _ covering Europe, Latin America, the Asia-Pacific and the Middle East _ plus the civilian service secretaries and the uniformed service chiefs and commanders of U.S.-based major commands. Bacon was reluctant to reveal specifics of Cohen and Shelton's remarks, but said the two men gave directions on improving protection for U.S. forces, both at home and abroad. These were not orders for specific measures but urgings to look for ways to correct any existing weaknesses, Bacon said. The commanders spelled out the force protection measures they are taking and plan to take in the future, and they all expressed concern about paying for the improvements, he said. ``Obviously, if there's going to be enhanced force protection in certain ways, it would require greater resources,'' Bacon said. The commanders also were in agreement that more emphasis needs to be placed on finding technological solutions to such problems as defending the perimeters of U.S. military installations, Bacon said. He said the conference did not address specific threats, although that remains an issue as congressional committees investigate the circumstances of the Cole bombing. ___ On the Net: The USS Cole at http://www.chinfo.navy.mil/navpalib/news/news_stories/cole.html Pentagon casualty list at http://www.defenselink.mil/news/Oct2000/b10202000_bt648-00.html

there was an example from the pentagon, ironically today, of how terrorists of get their wa, at least in part. the pentagon is planning to bring the "cole" back to the u.s. on this gigantic transport platform called the blue marlin. but as of now, not by the shortest route. the pentagon frs that going through the suez canal, which goes through egypt, may make the ships vulnerable. instead, they are planning a six-week long trip around africa. two weeks longer than going through the canal.

Sue Weber supported Mel Carnahan for Senate. She still does, even after his death in a plane crash nearly two weeks ago. ``He was a great man,'' said Weber, whose commitment to vote for the late Democratic governor drew a smile and shake of the head Friday from Larry Weber, her husband of 35 years. ``Why people would go ahead and vote for someone deceased is beyond me,'' said her husband, who has been backing Carnahan's opponent all along. The candidate is dead, but the Carnahan campaign is still very much alive. Not only is his name still on the Nov. 7 ballot _ it was too late to remove it _ but polls taken after his burial show Carnahan still locked in a too-close-to-call race against Republican Sen. John Ashcroft. Nationally, at least two people have won election to the House posthumously, but it appears no senator has ever been elected after death. Carnahan, 66, his 44-year-old son Roger and a campaign adviser died in the Oct. 16 crash of a small plane Roger Carnahan was flying to a campaign rally. Since then, Missouri Democrats have issued bumper stickers and buttons with the slogan ``Still for Mel!'' and put out the word that a vote for Carnahan is a way to honor the memory of the popular governor and is tantamount to putting his widow, Jean, in the Senate. Mrs. Carnahan, 66, who has never run for office, said she will talk to her family this weekend and announce Monday _ eight days before the election _ whether she will accept Gov. Roger Wilson's offer to appoint her to the Senate if her late husband outpolls Ashcroft. ``I still believe deeply in the cause for which my husband lived and died,'' she said. ``These shared values are a permanent part of my being.'' Mrs. Carnahan would serve until the next general election, in November 2002. Many voters weren't waiting for her decision to declare their loyalty to her husband of 46 years. ``Any Democrat who fills the seat is better,'' said John Rogers, 34, a lawyer in St. Louis. Arnie Fagan, owner of Cool Stuff, a store in Columbia that sells beads, incense and ice cream to college students, said he has seen no squeamishness about voting for a dead man. ``Hey, if these kids who feel so powerless are told they can vote for a dead statesman who stood for something instead of a live politician from Washington, I think Carnahan wins,'' Fagan said. A poll published Friday in The Kansas City Star showed Carnahan still in a tie with Ashcroft. The Mason-Dixon poll taken on Monday and Tuesday _ following Carnahan's funeral _ gave the men 46 percent each, with a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points. The pollsters also explained to voters Wilson's plan to appoint Carnahan's widow. With the additional information, Carnahan's support rose to 47 percent, with Ashcroft at 45 percent, a difference that is not significant statistically. During a campaign stop in Springfield, Ashcroft wouldn't discuss the poll. A former two-term governor, Ashcroft said: ``I'm going to work real hard to talk to people about the issues and the experience I have. I believe the people will respond positively.'' At the Democratic Party office in Columbia, workers said they had handed out more than 400 Carnahan signs since his death. Doris Hawkins, 69, a retired teacher, said she had no political signs in her Columbia yard before Carnahan died. On Friday, she walked into the office and picked up the only sign left bearing Carnahan's name _ a party pitch for Carnahan, Gore-Lieberman and gubernatorial candidate Bob Holden. ``My next-door neighbor is a Republican and I want to agitate him a little bit,'' she said with a laugh. ``Of course I will vote Carnahan.'' Sue Weber will, too. She said she has confidence in Mrs. Carnahan. Larry Weber replied that Ashcroft has a record and is available to hold to his promises if re-elected. ``We know what Ashcroft stands for,'' he said. ``I don't want to elect a mystery.'' ___ On the Net: http://www.johnashcroft.org/ http://www.carnahan2000.com/

Yugoslavia's new president asked Friday for his nation to be admitted to the United Nations _ the first step to end eight years of isolation at the world body. In a letter sent to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, Vojislav Kostunica applied for membership as the successor state to the Yugoslav republic which broke apart in the early 1990s. On Wednesday, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Richard Holbrooke discussed Yugoslavia's U.N. membership with Kostunica at a Balkans summit in Skopje, Macedonia, saying he hoped Yugoslavia would soon rejoin the ``community of nations.'' Kostunica's decision to formally apply for U.N. membership is expected to be approved, ending an isolation that began after four Yugoslav republics declared independence. ``With the Russian leadership, we initiated the matter of Yugoslavia's return into the United Nations,'' Kostunica said Friday upon his return to Belgrade from a one-day trip to Moscow. ``Today, after consultations in Moscow and with Moscow's support, a letter was sent ... with this aim in view.'' In New York, U.N. deputy spokesman Manoel de Almeida e Silva confirmed that the letter had been received. ``It will be looked at by the legal side of the secretariat,'' he said. The General Assembly passed a resolution in 1992 requiring the Belgrade government to apply as a new nation to be a U.N. member following the declarations of independence in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia, Slovenia and Macedonia. Only the republics of Serbia and Montenegro remain part of Yugoslavia. For eight years, the Belgrade government refused to reapply, saying it should have been allowed to automatically assume the U.N. seat held by the former government, which was a founding member of the organization. The former Yugoslavia has remained a U.N. member, and its flag still flies at U.N. headquarters. But Yugoslavia has not been allowed to vote or speak in the General Assembly or participate in its activities. Annan's office is expected to forward Kostunica's application onto the Security Council and General Assembly after determining that Yugoslavia has accepted its legal obligations under the U.N. Charter to be a U.N. member, General Assembly spokeswoman Sue Markham said. The Security Council will make a recommendation and the Assembly will then make a final determination.

THE SENATE SUPPORT FOR GOVERNOR'S WIDOW She is not on the Missouri ballot for the U.S. Senate. And she has given no indication that she would serve if appointed. But a campaign to put Jean Carnahan in the Senate is nevertheless well under way, with support groups forming, one rally already held, more planned and e-mail messages that promote her flying in every direction. Jean Carnahan is the widow of Gov. Mel Carnahan of Missouri, a popular Democrat killed earlier this month in a plane crash while campaigning to unseat Sen. John Ashcroft, a Republican. His death came too late in the campaign to put a substitute Democrat on the ballot. Should Mel Carnahan win, and polls taken in the past few days indicate the race is a tossup, the new governor, Roger Wilson, a Democrat and Carnahan's lieutenant governor, has promised to appoint Jean Carnahan to serve for her husband. Jean Carnahan says it is too soon to commit to anything, and Missouri Republicans question the legality of the plan. SUDDENLY, TOSSUPS New polls indicate that the Senate races in Virginia and Michigan, once one-sided, are now tossups. In Virginia, a Mason-Dixon survey taken this week found the incumbent Democrat, Sen. Charles Robb, had closed to within 3 percentage points of his Republican challenger, former Gov. George Allen. For almost two years, Allen had enjoyed a comfortable lead in the polls over Robb. But in recent weeks, Robb has steadily closed the gap, thanks mainly to gains among women. In Michigan, an EPIC/MRA poll taken this week found that Rep. Debbie Stabenow, a Democrat, had pulled even with the Republican incumbent, Spencer Abraham, after trailing him for months. Two weeks ago, an EPIC/MRA poll found her 10 points behind. She and Abraham together have spent more than $16 million on the contest. GORE AND THE RAP STAR In Vice President Al Gore's latest appeal to young voters, he sat for an interview with Queen Latifah, a rap singer and syndicated talk-show host whose audience is chiefly between 18 and 24. In the interview, to be broadcast on Wednesday, Queen Latifah, whose real name is Dana E. Owens, gave Gore a ``pop-culture quiz,'' asking if he had ever worn leather pants. ``I don't think I have,'' he said. But he had a leather vest for riding his Harley, he said. Ever been caught speeding? ``I don't think I ever got caught speeding on my motorcycle,'' Gore answered. ``Certainly I got caught speeding in my car when I was younger. But that wasn't to say I wasn't speeding sometimes on my motorcycle. I look back on those days, and I feel like I'm very lucky to have survived.'' Then he added: ``Once, on a dare, we went double-dating on my motorcycle.'' At the time, he went on, he was wearing a tuxedo. Did he get pulled over? ``Actually, there was a blue light,'' Gore answered. ``And I can't say for sure that they were coming after us, but just on the chance that they were, we cut through an alleyway.'' And finally: ``On a woman, leather or lace?'' Gore mulled for a moment, then answered: ``Lace.'' UNION DOLLARS FOR GORE The political action committee of New York state's largest health-care union sent a $1 million check to the Democratic National Committee this week to bolster the campaign of Vice President Al Gore. The contribution, by 1199/SEIU, New York's Health and Human Service Union, followed an earlier donation of $1 million to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and a $600,000 donation to the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. `We are alarmed about the prospect of having George Bush as the next president and about the impact that will have on the labor movement,'' said Dennis Rivera, president of 1199, a division of the Service Employees International Union. ASSISTED-SUICIDE VOTE Residents of Maine vote next month on a ballot initiative that would allow very ill patients of sound mind to ask their doctors for medication to help them die. The latest poll on the Oregon-style proposal, conducted last weekend by by Strategic Marketing Services, found the electorate evenly divided, 43.5 percent for, 43.5 percent against and the rest undecided. In mid-September, a poll by the same company found that 67 percent of the state's voters supported the initiative. States like Michigan, where a similar initiative was defeated in 1998, have seen a similar dynamic as Election Day approaches. Some analysts say it may be because people support assisted suicide in general, but become troubled by the details of any particular law. TRAVEL LOG Vice President Al Gore spent Friday searching for votes in Pennsylvania, while Gov. George W. Bush boarded a bus for the second time this week and worked Michigan.

Hillary Rodham Clinton accused Rick A. Lazio on Saturday of exploiting ``for political gain'' the fatal terrorist attack on the destroyer Cole in Yemen, after the state Republican Party acknowledged it was paying for a telephone campaign in which New Yorkers are told that Clinton took money from ``a Mideast terrorism group _ the same kind of terrorism that killed our sailors on the USS Cole.'' The contributions to Clinton's campaign came from a fund-raiser sponsored by the American Muslim Alliance. Clinton returned the money, $50,000, after the committee's leader was quoted as condoning violence against Israel to advance the battle for a Palestinian state. American investigators have said that they strongly believe terrorists were behind the Oct. 12 bombing attack on the Cole, in which 17 sailors died, but there has been no indication that the explosion was connected to any organization that gave money to Clinton. In Ithaca on Saturday, where Clinton began a three-day bus tour across New York, the first lady somberly denounced Lazio for the telephone campaign, and urged him to apologize to the families of the slain sailors. ``I went to that memorial service,'' she said. ``I met those families. I just really never thought I would see this kind of tactic used. It is beyond anything I have ever heard of, and I have heard of some pretty terrible techniques and tactics during campaigns in the past. This hits a new low.'' Television coverage of the memorial service for the sailors, which Clinton attended with the president in Norfolk, Va., showed the first lady crying much of the time. Lazio's aides said on Saturday that state Republican leaders had not consulted them before beginning the telephone campaign. But state party leaders, and Lazio, stood by the telephone campaign, asserting that it was fair and denying Clinton's assertion that they were injecting a national tragedy into what is the most closely watched Senate race in the nation this year. ``I don't think we need any instructions or lessons from the Arkansas political machine that Clinton affiliates with,'' Lazio said after a rally at a high school on Long Island. ``We don't need any advice from Harold Ickes and Hillary Clinton on how to run a campaign in New York, especially from people who are forced to return $50,000 to people who associate themselves with violence in the Middle East.'' Ickes is a senior adviser to Clinton. Reports of the telephone calls, and the harsh exchange between the two candidates on Saturday, came as the race for the Senate entered its final 10 days, with polls showing it to be an extremely close contest. Saturday's exchange was the toughest yet between Clinton and Lazio, and signaled what aides to both sides said would be a bitter finale to what has been a surprisingly restrained contest. The Republican Party's use of the telephone calls was first reported on Saturday in The New York Post, and on the ABC News Web page. The remarks about Clinton and the Cole were told to New Yorkers as part of one of at least two telephone campaigns being financed by the Republican Party. One campaign is directed at Jewish voters and the other to non-Jewish voters. A spokesman for the state Republican Party, Dan Allen, declined on Saturday to say how many people were being called, but he said the effort was extensive. He also said that neither campaign constituted push-polling, a practice in which telephone workers pose as pollsters, calling voters and asking questions that are intended to spread damaging or false information about an opponent. In both campaigns, Allen said, workers state at the beginning that the telephone call is being made on behalf of the Republican Party. In the call to Jewish voters, Allen said, the caller asks, for example: ``Did you know that before Clinton started her run for our U.S. Senate seat, she supported a Palestinian state and didn't support moving the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem?'' In the call to non-Jewish voters, the caller says that Clinton accepted money from an organization that ``openly brags about its support for a Mideast terrorism group, the same kind of terrorism that killed our sailors on the USS Cole.'' Allen said that the chairman of the state Republican Party, William Powers, thought that that line was fair because the group referred to, Hamas, was the same kind of organization that investigators say might be behind the attack on the Cole. ``This is something that Clinton is upset about,'' Allen said. ``But it's something she has to answer for.'' Clinton's aides clearly viewed the telephone campaign as a political misstep, coming during a critical stretch of the campaign, and moved quickly to turn it to their advantage. Former New York City Mayor Edward Koch was dispatched to City Hall to hold a news conference denouncing Lazio, while the campaign sent out a statement from Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., a veteran of the Vietnam War, asserting that Lazio had turned the Cole tragedy into part of ``a political smear operation.'' Lazio's campaign, meanwhile, moved on Saturday to turn the attention back on Clinton, noting that in her filing with the Federal Election Commission, she identified Abdurahman Alamoudi, a board member of the American Muslim Council who gave her $1,000, as a member of the ``American Museum Council.'' Alamoudi has been quoted in interviews as making statements sympathetic to Hamas, a militant group that advocates violence against Israel. A news release put out by Lazio's campaign quoted Gov. George Pataki, a Republican, as assailing Clinton, saying: `` Clinton should say why she filed this under the American Museum Council, and not the American Muslim Council.'' A spokesman for Clinton, Howard Wolfson, said the mistake was a typographical error. ``Congressman Lazio will say anything to avoid taking responsibility for these phone calls.''

Ivory Coast's new government pledged Saturday to track down the killers of dozens of young men whose bodies were found dumped in a field _ men who opposition officials and witnesses say were executed by government security forces. The gruesome discovery of the 55 bodies Friday, and the allegations that the country's paramilitary police could be involved, cast a shadow over the new government. Less than a week after an uprising drove the military ruler from power and only two days after street fighting here ended, the reports also fueled the uneasiness that regularly sparks rumors of renewed violence in Abidjan, Ivory Coast's main city. The corpses all appeared to be young men who had been shot. They were still tangled grotesquely on top of one another Saturday in a field surrounded by forest on the edge of Abidjan's Yopougon neighborhood. Twisted at obscene angles, most of the bodies were naked or only partially clothed. Officials in white gowns, rubber boots and plastic gloves sorted through the corpses as the country's new interior minister arrived in a large motorcade, accompanied by soldiers and paramilitary police. ``I am ashamed of what we are seeing here,'' said the minister, Emile Boga Doudou, a surgical mask to ward off the stench hanging around his neck. ``The police must do their work to find the author of this atrocity.'' But to followers of opposition leader Alassane Dramane Ouattara, who say those dumped in the field were fellow members of his Rally of the Republicans party, Ivorian authorities cannot be trusted to investigate the crime. ``It is security forces that killed them,'' said Amadou Coulibaly, a party spokesman. He said at least 155 Ouattara supporters have been killed in Abidjan since Wednesday, and at least 22 in other Ivorian cities. Those numbers could not be independently confirmed. Coulibaly said that in Abidjan, some of those killed were grabbed by militant supporters of newly installed President Laurent Gbagbo, handed over to security forces and not seen again until their corpses were spotted in the pile. Area residents backed up his account, saying on condition of anonymity that Gbagbo militants, backed by paramilitary police and soldiers, had forced their way into the homes of Ouattara's most ardent followers, beating young men and hauling them away. ``They broke down the door,'' said one man, a taxi driver who said six of his relatives were taken away by Gbagbo supporters backed by security forces. The driver escaped by fleeing the house. The discovery of the bodies followed three days of violence that drove out military junta leader Gen. Robert Guei and then turned to fighting between rival opposition forces. The unrest has left some 200 people dead. Guei had claimed victory in Ivory Coast's Oct. 22 presidential election, a vote that was dogged by fraud and unfair competition charges. In less than a day, he saw power slip from his grasp as thousands of demonstrators took to the streets. Later joined by security forces, they swept Gbagbo, who ran against Guei in the election, to power. Gbagbo's victory, though, set off another round of unrest as Ouattara's supporters launched protests to call for new elections. Those protests led to even more violence, with political fighting turning into horrific sectarian attacks. Gbagbo's mostly southern Christian supporters battled Ouattara's followers, most of them northern Muslims. Ouattara was thought to have more support than Gbagbo, but he was barred from Sunday's vote by the Supreme Court, as were other opposition figures.

As the skies cleared and the sea calmed, Norwegian divers started carving a new hole in the Russian nuclear submarine Kursk on Saturday in a tricky mission to recover more of the 118 men killed when it sank. A fierce storm on the Arctic site of the Barents Sea forced the suspension of the operation Friday. But the wind lessened overnight and divers began heading down to the submarine, said Vladimir Navrotsky, spokesman for the Russian Navy's northern fleet. The divers worked through Saturday to cut a hole through the thick rubber covering the submarine and the outer hull above the Kursk's ninth compartment. Weather permitting, Navrotsky said the divers would likely cut through the thicker inner hull Sunday and venture inside soon afterward. Saturday's work was being done only by Norwegian divers because winds were still strong, Navrotsky said. Russian regulations prevent Russian divers from resuming work until the waves are less than 12 feet. Family members of the Kursk's crew waited anxiously Saturday for a helicopter to deliver the four bodies already recovered from the diving site to the ship's home port of Severomorsk. The bodies were pulled out Wednesday through a hole cut in the ship's eighth compartment. A memorial ceremony was initially planned for the four Saturday in Severomorsk, but it was postponed until Sunday because the gale prevented helicopters from bringing the four bodies ashore. Winds had not calmed enough by Saturday night for the trip, prompting concerns that it would be put off again. In a chilling discovery, officials found a note in the pocket of one of the recovered submariners saying that 23 sailors had remained trapped alive in the ninth compartment for at least several hours after the powerful explosions that sank the submarine Aug. 12. Many Russians have questioned the need for the risky, expensive recovery effort. It has revived the emotional debate over how Russian authorities handled the accident, including the two-day delay in announcing the accident and a longer wait before accepting foreign help in the failed rescue attempt. ``Maybe they shouldn't have retrieved the bodies,'' Russian Orthodox priest Daniil Topolev said Saturday. ``You can compare this to as if people have already been buried, and then uncovered again.'' Topolev, speaking on the grounds of his small church in the Barents port of Murmansk, near Severomorsk, said the fact that some of the sailors did not die immediately was significant in Orthodox tradition. ``They had time to repent. That's already good. Those who died at once, maybe they had time to cross themselves and say: Lord, save us. And those who remained, could repent,'' he said. The cause of the disaster has not been determined. Russian officials have focused on the theory that the blasts were set off by a collision with another, possibly foreign, ship. But others have said the most likely cause was a torpedo exploding in its tube.

President Clinton has signed into law a bill allowing US exports of food and medicine to Cuba. Nevertheless, Mr. Clinton says he is not satisfied with the measure. It purports to allow the export of American products to Cuba, yet it makes it virtually impossible for family farmers to arrange the financing that enables such sales to take place. The new law bars the US government and US banks from providing funds for such exports at the insistence of Cuba's congressional critics. The law also prevents Mr. Clinton or his successor from easing restrictions on travel to the communist country.

Well, the remarkable outing, and I guess we could call it that, of the Secretary of State Madeleine Albright to North Korea seems to have completely broken through what had been a diplomatic isolation. But a lot of people seem to be saying Joe, that one should not be too hasty in embracing North Korea and bringing her into the international fold. What do you think? Yeah, I think it's very significant that Kim Jong Il clearly has made a decision that his own leadership, his own position politically and the economy of Korea required a change in policy. And for him breaking out into the international community is a major change in strategy, after all he is establishing relations with countries around the world and so forth. But I think there is a danger for getting prematurely the characteristic regime and its history and I thought that Mrs. Albright went overboard a bit in her enthusiasm and in her failure to make the point that we make every time an American leader goes to China about their human rights record, naturally so. So I think that the excessive euphoria is something we have to watch and the idea that is being mooted that President Clinton should go to pay a visit on North Korea before he leaves, I think it's ridiculous and the interesting thing is even though the White House continuously seems to encourage that report, I haven't heard a single foreign policy expert or a newspaper editorial that endorses the idea. Tom, why do you think President Clinton would want to go to North Korea? Well, this is legacy building. He has become the most traveled President in the history of our country, overtaking former President George Bush and then some, he is desperate to embellish his credentials with history as he heads out of the door. And I think he is, I agree with Joe, I think he is stretching just a little bit here, but Joe is right David, about the White House. The White House is telling reporters who have signed up the trip to Vietnam that we are expecting to go to Korea, North Korea, as well. So they are behaving at the White House like it's a fait accompli. This will be during December, I assume. Well, it begins I think the 16th of November when the President goes to Brunei. Well, he goes to Hawaii and then to Brunei and then to Vietnam and we are talking about North Korea and then Tokyo, so it will be about a 10-day extravaganza. Tom, is there a precedent for this? Let's suppose, I mean, it's certainly possible that Governor George Bush might win, of having an outgoing President essentially handing over to a new administration, but leading, opening all kinds of new diplomatic initiatives before he goes? I can never remember this happening David. Normally an outgoing administration, and let's face it, we've known this administration was outgoing for quite a while. Even if Vice President Gore wins, there is going to be a lot of new faces certainly at the State Department. Normally, in the last six months of administration, it mainly reduces to prudence stewardship in foreign policy because you would want a new government to be able to make the sort of decisions without having their hands forced by new policy initiatives. So I think this is quite unusual and probably not very smart in terms of diplomacy.

Let's go to Russia right now Joe, where Vladimir Putin who still remains something of an enigmatic presence in the Russian political scene since he took office at the beginning of the year 2000, is apparently under siege yet again by revelations that the Russians might possibly have been able to rescue those trapped sailors in the Kursk submarine because some of them evidently survived and it's apparent that the Russian military suppressed information about what had happened or even distorted it, and was singularly slow in taking up offers of assistance from the Norwegians and the British to help. What impact do you think this new revelation has on Putin's political stature? Oh, I think it is another step in a diminution of Putin. I think a number of things have happened; his attempt to restore the image of Russia as a great power has been, I think backfired generally, the he plunged Milosevic long after it was clear that he was finished. He has tried to form a strategic relationship with China and India, but this I think has reflected in a much more dramatic way, the weakness of Putin. After all, you've got to remember that when the Kursk went down, he was on vacation in the Black Sea and didn't bother even to come back to Moscow, let alone going to Mermonsk at the scene of the disaster and they held back for days before they requested help from Norwegian and British experts and those kind of thing, and I think that there is a sense that it may have contributed to the disaster. Tom, what's the thinking in the administration of Putin's performance so far? Very disappointing. Putin, it's clear he is no new style democrat, to put it mildly. This is a man who still behaves like a KGB operator rather than a ... Which, of course, he was. Yeah, for many, many years at a high level, than a President of a country trying to grapple with democracy. I think the Clinton administration it was hopeful for Boris Yeltsin and then it got disappointed in Yeltsin and then they thought that reluctantly Mr. Putin was a man that they could do business with, to coin former Prime Minister of Britain Margaret Thatcher's phrase about Mikhail Gorbachov. But Putin is disappointing the United States government. They won't say that of course, but he has turned out to be a disappointment. And I agree with Joe, I think these latest revelations that 23 sailors on the Kursk survived several days and theoretically might have been saved, had the Russians gotten off the dime and asked for help sooner, I think are devastating. And David, I think it's important the views that I think is gaining headway in the administration and voiced generally is that Putin is a bureaucrat and he runs the government in a bureaucratic kind of way and that it has no chance whatever of rebuilding the Russian economy and the Russian political stability, and that a continuing decline appears to be in the cards for Russia under his leadership.

Senate candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton said Saturday she was ``outraged'' that New York Republicans had linked her to the terrorist bombing of the USS Cole in phone calls to New York voters. ``I believe the Republican Party and Congressman Lazio owe an apology to the families of the sailors who died in the terrorist bombing of the USS Cole,'' she said. Clinton called the phone calls ``unacceptable,'' adding, ``Everyone should be condemning it.'' The Oct. 12 blast killed 17 U.S. sailors and injured 39 others. The state Republican Party refused to apologize and said Saturday that the calls would continue. Rep. Rick Lazio, Clinton's opponent in the New York Senate race, said New York Republicans didn't need ``any instructions or lessons from the Arkansas political machine'' surrounding Clinton. ``We don't need any advice from (Clinton adviser) Harold Ickes and Hillary Clinton on how to run campaigns in New York _ people who are now forced to return $50,000 to people who associate themselves with terrorism and violence in the Middle East,'' Lazio said. This past week, the Clinton campaign returned $50,000 that came from a Boston fund-raiser sponsored by a group that supports the Palestinian organization Hamas. The Clinton campaign denied knowing the group was involved with the fund-raiser. Lazio also charged that Clinton's campaign had hidden a $1,000 donation from a Hamas supporter, listing it as coming from the ``American Museum Council'' instead the American Muslim Council. The Clinton campaign has said the Museum/Muslim discrepancy was a typographical error. Clinton spokesman Howard Wolfson said Saturday that Lazio's charge was a smokescreen to cover his role in the GOP phone calls. ``Instead of more insults and finger-pointing, he should apologize to the families of the murdered sailors and stop the calls,'' Wolfson said. Lazio spoke after a rally at a Long Island junior high school. Clinton made her comments as she arrived in Ithaca to begin a three-day bus trip across upstate New York. Setting her off were newspaper reports Saturday that the New York State Republican Committee was calling voters to say that Clinton accepted money from an Arab organization that ``openly brags about its support for a Mideast terrorism group, the same kind of terrorism that killed our sailors on the USS Cole.'' Other calls also began going out in recent days to potential Jewish voters in which the state Republicans do not mention the USS Cole bombing, but do dwell on her dealings with Palestinians and her acceptance of contributions from Arab-Americans. A New York 1 News statewide poll out Thursday had Clinton leading Lazio, 50 percent to 43 percent. A New York Post/Fox 5 News poll to be published in Sunday's Post had them in a statistical dead heat. The New York Post also planned to publish its endorsement of Lazio on Sunday; Clinton was endorsed by The New York Times last week. In their final debate, held Friday, the two candidates testily hurled charges and repeatedly interrupted each other. ``Order, order! The speaker wants order,'' WNBC-TV host Gabe Pressman implored at one point. The verbal fireworks began just minutes into the one-hour debate when Lazio accused the Clinton administration of governing by poll results and the first lady of leaving Arkansas' schools ``at the bottom of the barrel.'' After arguing that ``the work we did in Arkansas received numerous awards and praise,'' Clinton said, ``I'm not here to defend Arkansas. I'm here to run for Senate to represent New York.'' ___ On the Net: http://www.hillary2000.org/ http://www.lazio.com/

In the Barent sea, divers recovered more bodies, Sunday from the undersea wreckage of the Russian submarine Kursk. All 118 seamen on the sub were killed after it was shattered by two explosions and crashed to the sea floor, last August. As the recovery work proceeded, a memorial ceremony for the Kursk crew was held Sunday in a Russian military seaport.

The battered US Navy destroyer Cole has begun its journey home from Yemen, 17 days after a suspected terrorist bomb tore a gapping hole in its side. The attack killed 17 American sailors and wounded 39. Flanked by other US warships and guarded by aircraft, the ship was towed out of Aden harbor to rendezvous with a huge Norwegian transport vessel that will carry the crippled ship back to the United States.

Her words have been dissected and her public actions have been under a microscope. But Jean Carnahan has remained closemouthed about whether she will accept an appointment to the U.S. Senate if her late husband receives more votes than his GOP rival. On Monday, Jean Carnahan was scheduled to officially make a decision after a weekend spent at her farm outside Rolla surrounded by family and friends. ``It's a decision she needs to make with her family,'' Marc Farinella, Mel Carnahan's campaign manager, said Sunday. And Farinella said a ``yes'' decision was no certainty. ``We all hope Jean agrees to do this. But we would certainly understand if she chooses not to. She has been through so much and it is asking a great deal,'' he said. Missouri's 66-year-old governor, the Carnahans' eldest son Roger, 44, and Carnahan adviser Chris Sifford, 37, died Oct. 16 when a small plane piloted by Roger Carnahan crashed outside St. Louis. Attention has focused on Mrs. Carnahan's public composure, measured statements and dignity since the crash, including urging mourners at Sifford's funeral last weekend: ``Don't let the fire go out.'' Gov. Roger Wilson offered Mrs. Carnahan, 66, who has never run for or held elected office, an appointment as senator if Mel Carnahan outpolls Republican incumbent John Ashcroft. Media polls released during the weekend, and taken after Mel Carnahan's burial, showed the Senate race still statistically tied, as it had been for months. A Zogby International poll conducted for the St. Louis Post-Dispatch and St. Louis television station KMOV had Mel Carnahan with 47.2 percent support against 45.4 percent backing for Ashcroft, a result within the poll's margin of error of plus or minus four percentage points. But Mel Carnahan's lead grew, 49.4 percent to 44.3 percent, after participants in the Zogby polls were told of Wilson's plan to name Jean Carnahan if her late husband wins the race. Carnahan fans weren't waiting on the widow. Volunteers converged on Mel Carnahan's St. Louis campaign headquarters during the weekend to distribute 780,000 lapel buttons proclaiming, ``I'm Still With Mel.'' Carnahan's name remains on the ballot because state officials said he died after a deadline for removing it. Farinella said Mel Carnahan's campaign was paying for the buttons and their distribution. The campaign canceled all of its scheduled TV advertising, receiving refunds of more than $1 million, he said. The prospect of Jean Carnahan stepping in for her late husband has drawn mixed but intense reaction from voters. Some say it's wrong to impose on her grief. Others suggest there are better qualified appointees. Republicans accuse Wilson of playing on sympathy to help Democrats, a charge Wilson has called ``demeaning'' to the Carnahan family. Announcing his offer to Mrs. Carnahan, Wilson said: ``I knew from the first time I thought about it ... there is no other person who has been near all of the critical issues'' that were important to Mel Carnahan, her husband of 46 years. ``Husbands and wives, they stand together, and she will keep going with what Mel Carnahan would have wanted to do,'' said Bobbi Slate, 29, a laundry clerk from Columbia. But Tony Garcia, 62, a retired plant superintendent, said it's unthinkable to vote for a dead person over a living candidate with a long record like Ashcroft. ``How can we not vote for someone who can represent the state?'' asked Garcia, of Columbia. ``I'm sure Jean Carnahan is a great lady, but that vote for her late husband doesn't make any sense.'' ___ On the Net: Ashcroft campaign: http://www.johnashcroft.com Carnahan campaign: http://www.carnahan2000.com

With its running tableau of disasters, both man-made and natural, Africa in the 1990s has shown an unerring knack for inspiring hand-wringing in the outside world and increasing self-doubt among Africans themselves about the waste and futility of half a century of independence. Now, like an exclamation mark, the century may be closing on the descent into chaos of what has long been one of Africa's brightest corners, the former French West African country where a deeply flawed election last week produced rampaging mobs and ethnically motivated lynching, not democratic rule. By week's end, negotiations among the power seekers had begun, and an uneasy calm had taken hold. Still, the death toll was well over 100. The trouble in Ivory Coast could be seen coming for at least five years, visible on the horizon like the darkness of a gathering storm. But as predictable as the disputed vote and the killings may seem, they were never inevitable. Ivory Coast's crisis has its roots in the usual cynicism and blind ambition of politicians, but just as surely in the indifference of an onlooking world. Where Africa is concerned, it seems, extinguishing fires before they can get out of hand is scarcely ever tried. For most Americans, the name of this country with 17 million inhabitants means nothing. In fact, there are few places in Africa today that could give the world more reason to care. For a stretch of countries from Mauritania to Nigeria, Ivory Coast, despite its modest size, has been something akin to what the United States has often been to Latin America. It has absorbed many far poorer neighbors _ more than 25 percent of the population is now foreign. With its huge exports of cocoa and coffee, sizable industrial base, good roads and working electricity and telephones (such things are not taken for granted in Africa, even today), Ivory Coast has served as the region's employer, its breadbasket, its banker, its educator and its hub. For years, foreigners there have repeated the joke about loving to live in the capital, Abidjan, ``because it's so convenient to Africa.'' More important, though, this was one of those rare African places that had a large and worldly middle class. If Ivory Coast's slide goes unchecked, all that will vanish. One need only visit Liberia next door, with its skyscrapers full of squatters, to see what a gutted capital looks like, and to realize that what took generations to build can burn in a blink. Emulation has always worked powerfully in Africa politics. In the 1960s, an often well-intentioned but ultimately disastrous socialism was in vogue. In the 1970s and '80s, leaders began naming themselves president for life. In the mid-1990's, with the Rwandan crisis, deadly mobilization along openly ethnic lines reared its head, spreading quickly through much of East and Central Africa. Even in faraway West Africa, Rwandization has become a familiar verb. For several years now, as in Rwanda, politicians have been playing to their ethnic bases, with the result that Ivory Coast is now seriously divided into three regions of roughly equal size: a Muslim north with cultural links to Mali and Burkina Faso, a Christian southeast, which has dominated the country's history, and a Christian and animist southwest with strong ancestral ties to Liberia and Guinea. If this sounds familiar, it should. Nigeria, Africa's most populous country, broke down along almost identical lines, leading to the Biafran War in 1967. The fear of many Africa watchers is that even worse than the regional economic disaster it would occasion, an ethnic explosion of Ivory Coast would set a pattern for the region for years to come. In fact, Nigeria is facing a resurgence of ethnic violence now. ``An Ivory Coast set ablaze by ethnic hatred will light a fire clear across this region,'' said one Western diplomat with longtime experience in West Africa. ``The only way to prevent it is for the world to engage all of the parties there and press them to respect some basic principles, especially the principle of compromise.'' Many Africans have been waiting for France to lead an international effort to pressure Ivory Coast's factions to negotiate. But the wait has been in vain. The United States has condemned many of the worst abuses in Ivory Coast, where its interests are few. But France, without whose help the former colony's economy cannot run, has remained largely silent , providing support and justification for leaders even as their abuses have grown more flagrant. While communism was falling in Eastern Europe a decade ago, much of Africa was experiencing popular revolutions of its own. In Mali, Benin, the Republic of the Congo and elsewhere, citizens who organized to demand democracy were overthrowing corrupt dictators. With little special outside help or attention, many of these early experiments in African democracy quickly foundered. But France, the only former colonial power to have maintained strong ties to its ex-possessions, worried that the end of personalized power under long-ruling dictators would open the region up to influence from others, notably the United States, and upset its interests in everything from oil fields to military bases.

Early in the 1990s, Paris decided to stem its losses by backstopping corrupt regimes in Ivory Coast, Cameroon and Gabon, resource-rich states that provided handsome returns. With the implicit backing of the French President Jacques Chirac, who had already said that Africa was ``not ready for democracy,'' Henri Konan Bedie, the Ivory Coast leader who took power after the death of the country's founder, Felix Houphouet-Boigny, in 1993, set out to eliminate his most important rival, a former prime minister named Alassane Ouattara. From 1995 until the end of last year, when he was overthrown in the country's first coup, Bedie ceaselessly improvised at eliminating his rival, a former deputy director of the International Monetary Fund. Bedie invented a bogus ideology, called Ivoirite, which sought to distinguish purebred citizens, mostly deemed to be his own southern Christians, from supposed latecomers, especially northern Muslims like Ouattara. This played on long-standing, latent hatreds. Bedie's southeastern Akan group had enjoyed the fruits of education and ultimately the power that grew out of their early contact with French colonizers. The Akan, who saw themselves as natural rulers, thought of the Muslim northerners as a ``dirty'' people. The southwesterners were disparaged as hotheaded near-savages. France never seemed to tire of Bedie, but the Ivoirian people did. Last Christmas Eve he was overthrown in an army coup that seemed intended to right his wrongs. That is, until the new president, Gen. Robert Guei discovered the intoxicating effect of ethnic exclusionism. Soon, he, too, was changing the rules to keep Ouattara out. Guei eliminated over a dozen rival candidates for the presidency, including those of the two largest parties, making a sham of this month's election. Having barred them from the race, the unpopular general was surprised to be soundly defeated in a low turnout by Laurent Gbagbo, a pioneer of the country's democracy movement. After the stunned general sought to proclaim himself president anyway, his military government was literally chased from office by tens of thousands of supporters of Gbagbo, who now claimed power. But in a country badly divided along ethnic lines, this left two-thirds of the population dangerously disgruntled and unrepresented, setting up the terrifying street confrontations between supporters of Gbagbo and Ouattara. While much of the world, from United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan and the U.S. State Department to South African President Thabo Mbeki and the Organization of African Unity, called for new, free elections, the French government, which has always seemed more preoccupied with African power than with process, rushed to back Gbagbo. ``Don't expect comments from us that could resemble a show of paternalism or lesson-giving,'' said a government spokesman responding to criticism by the French press for backing the winner of a bogus election out of pure expediency. ``It is not the French role.''

Japan and North Korea discussed the sensitive issue of Japanese amends for its colonial past on Monday when the often-hostile countries opened their third round of talks this year on normalizing relations. The talks, in China's capital, come as Japan appears to be lagging behind other countries' diplomatic maneuverings in Northeast Asia's main flash point. Long isolated North Korea has in recent weeks held high-level meetings with the United States and moved to open ties with Britain, Germany and Spain. Meeting at Japan's embassy, Japanese chief negotiator Kojiro Takano and his North Korean counterpart, Jong Thae Hwa, agreed that the U.S.-North Korean talks and the historic summit with South Korea in June created a favorable trend, a Japanese Foreign Ministry official said. But in a sign of the difficulties in forging diplomatic ties, negotiators delved into tough issues Monday for the very first time in nine years of talks, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``We have only entered into the serious phase of real negotiations,'' said the official. The talks, scheduled to continue Tuesday, likely will yield only an agreement to continue talking, he said. Two previous rounds of talks this year sputtered over North Korea's insistence on compensation for Japan's often brutal 1910-45 occupation and Tokyo's demands for information on Japanese citizens allegedly abducted to North Korea to train spies. North Korea broke off talks on ties eight years ago after angrily rejecting Tokyo's demands to track down 10 Japanese citizens. Negotiations resumed in April, but North Korea has continued to deny abducting anyone. The Japanese official refused to confirm whether the abduction issue was raised Monday, but he said negotiators opened an in-depth discussion into Japan's colonial past and how Tokyo could compensate property and other claims related to the occupation. ``These are very tough issues,'' the official said. While Japan has rejected direct demands for compensation, Tokyo has expressed a willingness to extend economic aid, as it did upon normalizing relations with South Korea in 1965. Since the last round of talks in August, Japan has said it will send half a million tons of rice over the next two years to help ease acute food shortages in the North. North Korea's Jong reiterated Pyongyang's gratitude for the food shipment, the Japanese official said. With the North's economy near collapse, Japan's media have speculated that offers of hefty aid packages may be enough to tempt Pyongyang into overcoming any reluctance about signing a normalization agreement. Japanese negotiators also raised security concerns, in particular North Korea's nuclear and missile programs, the official said. North Korea's launch of a three-stage rocket over northern Japan two years ago prompted Japan and the United States to research an anti-missile defense shield for East Asia. If the United States, South Korea and other countries succeed in winning North Korean assurances about those programs, Tokyo and Pyongyang will be freer to focus on issues unique to their troubled ties, the official said.

Since the last round of talks in August, Japan has said it will send half a million tons of rice over the next two years to help ease acute food shortages in the North. North Korea's Jong reiterated Pyongyang's gratitude for the food shipment, the Japanese official said. With the North's economy near collapse, Japan's media have speculated that offers of hefty aid packages may be enough to tempt Pyongyang into overcoming any reluctance about signing a normalization agreement. Japanese negotiators also raised security concerns, in particular North Korea's nuclear and missile programs, the official said. North Korea's launch of a three-stage rocket over northern Japan two years ago prompted Japan and the United States to research an anti-missile defense shield for East Asia. If the United States, South Korea and other countries succeed in winning North Korean assurances about those programs, Tokyo and Pyongyang will be freer to focus on issues unique to their troubled ties, the official said.

Thousands of people have gathered in the Spanish capital, Madrid to demonstrate their revulsion at today's bomb attack blamed on the Bask separatist group ETA. The state department has condemned the attack which killed a Spanish supreme court judge and two of his police escorts. Flora Bodsferd reports. The demonstrators gathered in the center of Madrid to show their anger and revulsion at the continuing violence blamed on ETA. Their chanting made the point that they weren't against Bask people in general, only the separatist organization which claims it is fighting in their name. There is no doubt amongst government and security officials that this latest attack was the work of ESA. A car bomb detonated just as the car carrying supreme court Judge Jose Francisco Kerow went past. His driver and body guard were also killed. Flora Bodsferd, BBC News, Madrid.

It is impossible for any outsider to know exactly why North Korea has changed its tack so dramatically in recent months, inviting old enemies from South Korea and the United States to the capital, Pyongyang, and toasting them lavishly. But it was clear last week that the North Korean leader, Kim Jong Il, had impressed his long-skeptical guests as someone Washington could work with when, during one of his country's vast choreographed extravaganzas, he made a quip to Secretary of State Madeleine Albright about cooperation on missiles. The reasons guessed at for North Korea's campaign range from sheer distress because of repeated famines and a collapsing economy, to a push from the country's Chinese benefactors, who are eager to remove North Korea and its weapons programs from Washington's list of justifications for developing high-tech missile shields. But for all the attention to the reception given to Albright, the scenes of conciliation and good cheer were merely the latest in a gradually accelerating transformation that has been under way for at least a year. If the shift away from brinkmanship has been most visible at the top, diplomats and international aid workers who have had either long or recently intense exposure to the country say that the changes are even more impressive at the more mundane level of contacts with diplomats and middle-level bureaucrats. North Korea has been on a diplomatic blitz for a full year now, establishing or planning links with Britain, Canada, Australia, Italy and France. ``Meeting with North Korean officials used to be like watching a man try to cross a river by feeling the rocks under his feet one by one,'' said a diplomat from one of these countries. ``The only thing is that whenever the North Koreans reached a rock, you could never be sure they wanted to proceed any further.'' ``Nowadays,'' the diplomat said, ``you walk into a meeting with them for the first time, and before you can even get acquainted, they are saying, `Great, how quickly can we establish relations.''' The cynical view is that this diplomatic offensive merely seeks to collect as much aid as possible while diversifying the sources. Just as surely, though, these new engagements will quickly increase the exposure of people inside the world's most reclusive nation to outsiders and their influences _ a risky proposition, which perhaps explains why such an opening has not been tried before. In a system like North Korea's, in which power is highly concentrated and closely held, that such changes are taking place reflects decisions made at the summit of power. But it is just as clear that few of the changes have been explained to people down through the bureaucracy. Now, suddenly, people in a nation that, with China's help, fought the United States to a standstill in the Korean War, and have been told all their lives that Americans are wolves, are seeing their leaders making merry with the enemy. ``Why are people suddenly so cooperative?'' said a Western diplomat whose country is planning to open relations soon with Pyongyang. ``Because they know the instructions have come from the chairman to smile and get as much help from the outside as possible, and they know they'd better not fail. But boy are they confused.'' The confusion theme was repeated by almost every Westerner with experience in North Korea. ``Decisions in a pyramidal society like this are so centralized, so political and so personal, that it is hard for Americans to understand that kind of pressure,'' said Peter Hayes, co-executive director of the Nautilus Institute, a private aid group that has been active in the country for years. ``Many people are confused,'' Hayes said. ``They don't know what the new edicts from the top mean. Those at the top might not even know. They are striking out in a completely new direction, and they are going to have to make it up as they go along.'' But frequent visitors say that given the sheer weight of the country's totalitarian ideology and generations of mass indoctrination, changing this country's course will be something akin to turning a huge ship at sea. Opening North Korea up, even modestly, and exposing people to the idea that Westerners _ and South Koreans _ are not devils, alone represents an extraordinary change. It also represents a fantastic gambit. The foremost task now for Kim is to make sure that the change does not become revolutionary, as his people begin to get a clearer idea of the deprivation they have suffered, especially relative to their neighbors. ``This is a society that has been focused most of all on stability, and they have been guided all along by a stable ideology,'' said one international aid worker who has visited the country often. ``If you talk to officials there now, though, suddenly they feel like they are being carried along by a wave, and to say the least, they are perplexed.''

A car bomb exploded in a residential area of the capital Monday, killing a Supreme Court judge, his bodyguard and driver in the deadliest attack blamed on the Basque separatist group ETA since it ended a 14-month cease-fire in December. Thirty-five people were injured in the Madrid bombing, which tore holes in cars, shattered windows for blocks and left a haze of white smoke and burning debris scattered through the neighborhood. The slain judge, 69-year-old Jose Francisco Querol, worked for a military section of the court. He held the rank of general and was due to retire next month, said the General Council of the Judiciary, a judicial oversight body. Also killed were his driver, Armando Medina Sanchez, and Jesus Escudero Garcia, a member of the national police force. Although no group claimed responsibility for the blast, Spanish politicians and news media immediately blamed ETA. The group has repeatedly used car bombs as part of its 32-year-old campaign for an independent Basque homeland in an area straddling northern Spain and southwest France. ``This looks every bit like an ETA attack,'' Interior Ministry spokesman Fernando Delgado said. ``This morning we were again invaded by the pain of blind terrorism. ETA has caused a terrible attack in Madrid,'' King Juan Carlos said. ``To the assassins goes our firm condemnation and the certainty that they will pay for their crimes sooner or later.'' Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar urged Spaniards not to despair over ETA's continuing violence and vowed to stand firm in his policy of combatting the group through police measures rather than talks. ``It is clear that no one will achieve any kind of objective through the force of violence, and that no one will make Spaniards yield to threats of guns, whoever may be holding them,'' said Aznar, who survived an ETA assassination attempt in 1995. There was no word from ETA after Monday's attack. The group usually takes weeks to claim responsibility, and often does so in communiques sent to a pro-independence Basque newspaper. The attack came at 9:15 a.m. as people were going to work and children to school in the Arturo Soria area of northeastern Madrid. As the judge drove past an intersection, another car parked at the spot and rigged with a bomb was detonated by remote control, police said. Querol lived in the area, and his wife and daughter heard the blast from their home. A city bus waiting to turn into the intersection was severely damaged, its front section gutted by flames and windows blown out. The driver suffered serious injuries, said emergency medical services spokesman Emilio Benito. There were few passengers aboard, and none was seriously injured, he said. The explosion left smoldering cars and broken glass littering the street. It filled the air with thick, white smoke from burning garbage from six large trash bins on the corner where the bomb went off. It shattered windows in apartment buildings for three blocks and knocked tiles off bathroom walls. Afterward, stunned residents and pedestrians cried, hugged each other and held hands. ``I was just waking up when I heard a tremendous explosion. It blew out my windows and I put my arms over my head,'' said 24-year-old Ricardo Villaverde, who lives in an apartment just above where the bomb exploded. ``The glass cut my face,'' he said. ``I looked out the window and people were crazy and panicking in street.'' The explosion took place 50 yards from a school. There were no immediate reports of children being injured. Police cordoned off the area for fear that another bomb may have been planted. ETA has been blamed for some 800 killings since 1968, including 19 since it ended a 14-month cease-fire last December. The last attack blamed on ETA was Oct. 22, when a prison officer was killed by a bomb attached to his car in the Basque city of Vitoria. The death toll in Monday's blast was the highest of any of the attacks since the cease-fire ended. Twice _ on February 22 and Aug. 20 _ two people died in car bombings blamed on ETA. As evening fell, hundreds of people opposed to ETA violence gathered in downtown Madrid to protest the attack. The rally began with five minutes of silence, interrupted when a man shouted in favor of Basque independence. Others punched him and struck him with placards; police intervened to protect him. Similar demonstrations were held in the Basque cities of Vitoria, Bilbao and San Sebastian. A larger demonstration was planned for Tuesday in Madrid. A funeral ceremony for Monday's victims was to be held Tuesday at the Supreme Court. U.S. State Department spokesman Richard Boucher denounced those responsible for the car bombing, calling it a ``cowardly and brutal attack.''

A Dutch court on Monday acquitted a doctor who helped his depressed patient commit suicide even though the man was not suffering unbearable physical pain. The ruling could be interpreted as a further stretching of the already liberal standards for euthanasia in the Netherlands, where assisted suicide is illegal but commonly practiced. The public prosecutor in Haarlem sought a three-month suspended sentence for the doctor, whose name is not published in accordance with Dutch privacy regulations. The doctor had given a lethal drug cocktail to Edward Brongersma, an 86-year-old former politician who suffered from severe depression. He had attempted suicide two years earlier. Euthanasia is tolerated in the Netherlands if it fulfills understood criteria, including one that says the patient must be undergoing ``unbearable suffering, devoid of any hope.'' The court agreed with experts who argued that suffering need not be unrelenting physical pain. The Dutch parliament is deliberating legislation that would legalize euthanasia and set clearly defined standards. These would stipulate that the patient must be terminally ill, be in unbearable pain and clearly request a mercy killing.

Doubled over with back and joint pain, U.S. businessman Edmond Pope was rushed to a Moscow prison clinic Tuesday and his espionage trial was adjourned for at least two days, his lawyer said. Pope, 54, has suffered from bone cancer, but it was in remission when he arrived in Russia this spring. The court here had repeatedly rejected Pope's earlier appeals to take his ailing health into consideration or to allow English-speaking doctors to examine him. Defense lawyer Pavel Astakhov speculated that Pope's attack Tuesday signals the cancer is resurfacing, something Pope's relatives have long feared. ``This morning he said he didn't feel well. Then, during the trial's lunch break, he had a fit of serious pain,'' Astakhov said. Pope was taken to the Lefortovo prison, where he has been held since his arrest in April, and prison doctors determined he was suffering severe inflammation in his joints and back, Astakhov said. ``They brought us a statement from prison doctors that said for two days there is no way Edmond could take part in the trial,'' he said. ``We think it's connected to his disease. The symptoms are the same.'' Judge Nina Barkina adjourned the proceedings until at least Thursday. Astakhov was not allowed to speak to Pope after the incident. He said he believed Pope had been returned to his cell. The trial in a Moscow city court is being conducted behind closed doors. Prosecutors in the case have refused to talk to reporters. In Monday's proceedings, Barkina refused to accept U.S. medical documents relating to Pope's health on the grounds that the material was in English and unacceptable in the Russian court. In Washington, meanwhile, State Department spokesman Richard Boucher repeated a U.S. plea for Pope's release. Pope, a retired U.S. Navy officer from State College, Pa., was arrested on April 3 in Moscow on charges of trying to buy classified plans for a high-speed torpedo used by the Russian Navy. Pope has pleaded innocent. His supporters have said the plans were for a 10-year-old technology that has already been sold abroad.

A Singapore Airlines 747 jetliner taking off for Los Angeles slammed back onto the runway in high winds and rain Tuesday night, scattering flaming wreckage across the tarmac. At least 68 of the 179 people on board were injured, airline officials said. Local TV stations reported that four people were killed and that 93 people were unaccounted for, but there were conflicting reports about casualties. Singapore Airlines spokesman James Boyd said in Los Angeles that there were no known fatalities among the people on board Flight SQ006. Strong winds from a typhoon offshore seemed to have forced the plane down at Taipei's Chiang Kai-shek International Airport, emergency official Wu Bi-chang said. Despite the rain, video footage showed parts of the plane spewing gouts of flame and thick black smoke. Afterward, parts of the plane's blue fuselage appeared badly charred, with a gaping hole in the roof of the forward section. The plane came down at 11:18 p.m., and rescue workers were being dispatched to the scene, Wu said. Minutes later, the flashing lights of ambulances and rescue vehicles were visible on the wet tarmac. Local media reports said there was a fire on the runway but that it had been extinguished. John Diaz, an American passenger on the flight, said flames ``shot up right next to me'' as the plane tried to take off. He said there was ``heavy, heavy rain'' at the time. ``When I got the airport conditions were so bad, and I asked them, 'is the flight going to take off?''' Diaz told CNN. ``And they said, 'we do this all the time, it's fine.''' ``I told my wife, 'I can't believe they're going to take off,'' Diaz said. Another passenger identified only as Paul told CNN ``there was a very loud noise, the lights went out, the flames came across and we realized that at that point the plane crashed and we thought we were all going to die.'' ``We tried to get the back emergency exit open,'' he said. ``We couldn't get it open, we tried to make our way to the front and basically ... we saw the whole plane was broken in two.'' Local TV reports showed a frantic scene at a hospital near the airport, where emergency room workers gently lifted injured people from ambulances. Some appeared to be burned. They laid on stretchers with their arms stretched stiffly in front of their torsos. At Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Dr. T.L. Huang said 34 people were admitted and eight of them had life-threatening injuries _ mostly severe burns. Huang said 11 of those admitted were foreigners, but he said he could not yet provide their nationalities. In Singapore, officials set up a crisis management center at Changi airport. A handful of relatives, some on tears, were being led to the cordoned-off area by crisis workers. Singapore Airlines, the South Asian city-state's flagship carrier, is one of the world's most profitable airlines. It has been flying for 28 years and had never crashed. On Dec. 19, 1997, a SilkAir Boeing 737 was cruising over Indonesia at 35,000 feet when the jet suddenly nosed down, diving at supersonic speeds until it smashed into a river, killing all 104 people aboard. Singapore Airlines is the parent company of SilkAir. The storm pounding Taiwan, Typhoon Xangsane, had whirled closer to the island's southern coast on Tuesday and heavy rains have already begun soaking the capital, Taipei. The typhoon was packing 90 mph winds and was expected to make landfall by Wednesday if it maintained its current course, the Central Weather Bureau said. Earlier in the evening, the storm had prompted officials to set up disaster relief centers, cancel some flights, call off classes and raise land and sea warnings. Typhoon relief and coordinating centers were set up all over southern Taiwan, and officials warned residents against landslides and flash floods. The incident comes a year to the day after EgyptAir Flight 990 plunged into the Atlantic Ocean while en route from New York to Cairo. That disaster killed 217 people. ___ On the Net: http://www.singaporeair.com SIA spokesman Wilson Heng said 68 people were injured and in the hospital. he said 16 people walked away from the crash unhurt. ``The status of the remaining passengers needs to be confirmed,'' he said. He said he could not confirm reports that a passenger had died. Of the crew, he said one cabin crew member has been hospitalized. SIA said in a statement that the flight commander reported hitting an object on the take off run.

The aborted takeoff occurred at 11:18 p.m. Minutes later, ambulances and rescue vehicles crowded the wet tarmac, lights flashing. Boyd said there were 159 passengers and 20 crew aboard the plane. Of the passengers, 68 were hurt, 16 were not hurt and 75 were unaccounted for, he said. He said one crew member was hurt and three were not. He did not mention the fate of the other 16 crew members. ``You could feel that they were having problems controlling the plane when it started to take off. It started shaking. Then I heard an explosion,'' one unidentified, badly burned survivor told SCTN cable TV news from his hospital bed where he laid with a white bandage wrapped around his head and eyes.

This is the World, I'm Lisa Mullins. Tens of thousands of Spaniards took to the streets today to express their outrage at the latest terrorist bombing blamed on the Basque separatist group ETA. The car bomb detonated in Madrid yesterday killing one of the Spain's Supreme Court justices along with his driver and bodyguard. Now Spain is bracing for even more violence. As the Worlds Clark Boyd reports. Madrid's Monday morning rush hour was thrown into turmoil yesterday when police responded to a car bomb attack in one of the cities more affluent neighborhoods. Yes, as authorities claimed the bombing is the work of the ETA. It would be the bloodiest attacks since the separatist group broke a 14 months cease-fire last December. The blast took the lives of three people including that of 70-year-old Supreme Court Judge, Jose Francisco Kerow and left more than 30 injured. It didn't take long for citizens in the Spanish capital to respond. Shouting "No" to ETA, but "Yes" to the Basque people, demonstrators in Madrid expressed their displeasure with the bombing, which even Basque Governments spokesman Hezu Honimaz criticized. ETA speaks of democracy, said Emaz, but he knows nothing of democracy. He said ETA has instead tarnished the image of the Basque people once again. But not everyone in the Basque country of Northern Spain and Southwestern France sees it that way. Since, 1968 ETA has been fighting a low level war with the Spanish government, in a bid to secure a separate Basque nation. And last December, after a 14-month cease-fire and one fruitless round of talks, the group said it would once again take up arms, and it has. This month alone six people have been killed in ETA related violence. Some Bascs like Gorka Espeal who is the Director a Basque organization devoted to dialog, says yesterdays violence only underscores the need for the sides to return to the negotiating table. Political dialog is the only one Democratic instrument that we go to achieve solution to these situations, and we do think that the Basque majority of the Basque population and also the Spanish population are demanding political talks to transform the situation. But on Spanish radio Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar rejected calls for dialog with ETA and said his government would continue to use force to combat the group. That's a sentiment shared by many Spaniards today, as Judge Kerow and 2 other victims of yesterdays bombing were laid to rest. For the World, this is Clark Boyd.

The Pentagon denies US warships are steering clear of the Suez Canal in the wake of the apparent terrorist bombing of the destroyer Cole in Yemen although none has used the Canal, since the attack on the Cole earlier this month. VOA's Alex Belida reports security along the Suez is being re-evaluated. At the same time, US forces in two gulf countries have been put on alert against possible terrorist action. Pentagon Spokesman, Ken Baken, says US forces in Kuwait and Saudi Arabia have now been placed on threat condition delta, the highest state of alert. The move ordered Monday, follows the earlier decision to place US forces in Bahrain and Qatar on the same delta status, because of terrorist threats. US forces in the Yemeni harbor of Aden were elevated to delta immediately following the deadly October 12th terrorist bombing of US destroyer Cole. Mr. Baken says the heightened alert in Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, affects some 10,000 US military personnel in those two countries. He says it was ordered because of what he termed credible threats, but he says no targets were specified. The Pentagon spokesman is meanwhile disputing news reports saying the Defense Department has decided to order US navy ships to temporarily stop using the Suez Canal out of fear of terrorist attack. Mr. Baken says no such instructions have been given, but he acknowledges security along the Canal is being constantly evaluated. We are evaluating with the Egyptians. Obviously, the security situation in the Canal, we do that all the time. So, with the Egyptians we both have a very fundamental interest in keeping the Canal secure. No US ships have transited through the Canal since before the October 12th attack on the US destroyer Cole in Aden, but Mr. Baken says no ships were scheduled to make the trip for several weeks. The badly damaged Cole has been towed out of Aden Harbor and is being loaded aboard a Norwegian owned heavy lift ship called the Blue Merlin. Mr. Bake, says no decision has yet been made on the route the Blue Merlin will take to return the destroyer to the United States for repairs. Alex Belida, VOA News, the Pentagon.

now, the latest on the crash of singapore airlines flight 006 at taiwan's chiang kai-shek international airport. the flight, bound for los angeles, barely left the ground when it slammed back down, in a fireball. distraught relatives of the victims are demanding to know why the plane took off in bad weather. but investigators are focusing on a possible obstruction on the runway itself. here's nbc's robert hager. as daylight brings the first shocking look at all that's left of the plane, the death toll climbs to at least 79 and may go higher still. 23 of the dead are americans. the plane's black box recorders have now been found and u.s. investigators are en route to taiwan to help. as for survivors -- we saw flashes of fire when the plane broke apart. flames came into the cabin, smoke. it was everywhere. many seated near the rear escaped through the huge gap left when it breaks away. what causes this tragedy? the pilot, who survived, says he was taxiing when suddenly you saw something in front of the plane. tried to jerk the nose up and take off early to miss it. but it was too late. he hit it and careens to one side. so far, investigators can't say what it was he hit. they are looking at heavy equipment working on air parallel runway but don't know if it was involved. they wonder if the plane was taxiing on wrong runway. the airline says there's no evidence of that. what about weather? the approaching typhoon. in california, this man who lost his mother and aunt and an uncle is angry. i don't know why the pilot had taken off in that kind of stormy weather with 80 mile per hour winds. i don't believe that was the right thing to do. airport officials say the wind was 35 miles an hour, gusting into the 50s. visibility about a third of a mile. well within the normally safe range. what if there was an obstacle on the runway? at takeoff speeds, the airport is traveling probably 200 feet every second or more. that would give the pilot six or seven seconds to see something he is approaching and react. that may not have been enough time. questions as investigators push to find out why this happened. robert hager, nbc news, washington.

A top Singapore Airlines official apologized Wednesday for Tuesday's crash of a jumbo jet in Taiwan that killed 79 passengers. Airline senior Vice-President Tee Hu Cho spoke in Los Angeles. It came to us as a shock. We are very sad, we are very sorry and we are trying our very best to cope with taking care of the passengers and the needs of the families. The airlines announced that it's providing 25000 dollars to each victim's family to cover expenses of traveling to Taiwan to retrieve the bodies of their loved ones. Singapore Airlines says it believes the Boeing 747 struck some sort of object on the runway during take off. Investigators say such a collision might have caused the jumbo jet to catch fire and break up.

Welcome to another hour of news and information on the Voice of America. I'm David Chadwick with VOA News Now. The United States says it wants to see more co-operation from the government of Yemen in the investigation into last month's terrorist attack on the navy destroyer, the USS Cole, which killed 17 American sailors. VOA's Nick Simeone reports. President Clinton has already written to Yemen's President asking for his full co-operation into the Cole bombing. But the New York Times quotes unnamed US officials are saying co-operation has only gotten worse and that FBI agents are not being allowed access to possible evidence obtained by the Yemeni government. All the FBI will say on the record is that it continues to work with the Yemeni authorities. But at State Department, Spokesmen Richard Boucher told reporters Washington is still pressing for full co-operation. We need more co-operation. We need extensive, we need different kinds of co-operation, different kind of access to evidence, the information, different kinds of procedures. We are working those things out. We are making progress in that regard. But Yemen may not be as interested in resolving the bombing as the United States. If it turns out that a country the State Department calls a safe haven for terrorists, could be accused of shouldering some of the blame for lax security. Tom Williams is a security expert at Security Management International, a company with expertise in protecting corporate and government assets around the world. If the witnesses have information that would point in any wrong direction, the Yemenis would want to make sure that they can control that information. Also, there is issues on sovereignty. The Yemenis could, if they already know what the information is entailing, there could be retribution against the Yemeni government. In neighboring Saudi Arabia, the investigation into a terrorist attack four years ago on the Cobar Towers Military Housing complex that killed 19 Americans, still remains unresolved. In that case as well, the FBI complained that Saudi authorities had not allowed its agents access to certain suspects. Nick Simeone, VOA News at the State Department.

On opposite sides of the world in Angola and on Taiwan, the search for the causes of separate air crashes continues. We have reports on each beginning with the Tuesday Taiwan crash of the Singapore Airlines jumbo jet, which so far has taken 79 lives. The United States said Wednesday, at least 10 Americans were among the dead. Grace Cutler reports, an approaching storm which hampered rescue efforts, may have blown something onto the rain swept runway causing the crash. Rescue workers Wednesday, pulled out the last of the dead from the wrecked Boeing 747. The death toll is expected to rise as passengers succumb to injuries. But some of the 20 crew members and 159 passengers on board did manage to walk away from the crash. The Singapore Airlines flight from Taipei to Los Angeles burst into flames after slamming into the runway moments after takeoff. The pilot who survived the crash says he hit something on the runway. It is still unclear what the doomed plane may have hit. Construction equipment could be seen on a neighboring runway and there were heavy rains and high winds brought by an approaching typhoon at the time of takeoff. Taiwan's Civil Aviation officials declined to comment on the cause of the crash until investigators study the plane's so called black boxes, the flight data and voice cockpit recorders. Anxious family members stood by in Taipei and Los Angeles awaiting news of their loved ones. The Airlines Chairman Michael Fam expressed regrets to all concerned and pledged to compensate families of the victims 25,000 dollars each. Officials say identifying the dead is a major task. While all the bodies were recovered, many were burnt beyond recognition. It was Singapore Airlines first major accident in decades. The Airline is one of Asia's most profitable and safe and ranks 11th in the World in terms of passenger traffic. Grace Cutler for VOA News, Hong Kong.

Divers slid video cameras attached to long rods into a hole in the mangled forward section of the sunken submarine Kursk on Thursday, to assess the chances of recovering more bodies, officials said. The massive internal damage to the nuclear-powered vessel could prevent divers from going further. The submarine was wracked by two explosions, one of which had the force of a small earthquake and was further magnified by the vessel's thick steel outer hull. ``It's already clear that the third compartment suffered serious damage as a result of the second powerful explosion,'' said Northern Fleet spokesman Capt. Vladimir Navrotsky, adding that the damage may be too extensive for the divers to enter the section. The Kursk sank on Aug. 12 after the two explosions, which tore through the forward compartments and most likely killed most of the 118 crew members instantly. But at least 23 sailors survived the initial explosion in the submarine's stern, as indicated by a letter found in the sub. One of the officers, Lt. Dmitry Kolesnikov, managed to write a farewell note to his wife before dying, and officials divulged small snippets from it last week. Kolesnikov's body lay in state Thursday in a former Czarist palace in his native city, St. Petersburg, and was to be buried later in the day. His coffin, draped in the St. Andrew flag of the Russian Navy, was surrounded by an honor guard in crisp dress uniform. During the memorial ceremony, officials released another fragment from his note. The excerpt was displayed in a black frame next to the coffin. ''15:45. It's dark to write here, and I'm trying to write blindly. It seems we have no chance, no more than 10-20 percent. I hope that at least someone will read this,'' Kolesnikov wrote, according to state-controlled ORT television. ``Here is a list of the crew who are in the ninth compartment and will try to get out. Greetings to everyone, don't lose hope,'' the note said. The time indicated, 3:45 p.m., was more than four hours after the two explosions sank the ship. Officials have not yet indicated whether the list of names followed. It took divers two days to cut through the Kursk's double steel hull into the forward compartment before inserting the video cameras, said navy spokesman Navrotsky. Earlier in the week, the divers stopped working on the eighth and ninth compartments in the rear of the submarine, where Kolesnikov's body and 11 others were retrieved. The divers risked puncturing their pressure suits or air tubes if they ventured further into the tangle of broken equipment, officials said. As the search moved to the forward compartments, Navrotsky appeared downbeat about the chances of recovering more remains, many of which were likely blown to bits by the explosions. ``Experts will decide whether to enter the third compartment or start work to cut a hole into the fourth compartment,'' he said. Russian officials have focused on the theory that the blasts were set off by a collision with another submarine shadowing Russian naval exercises in the Barents Sea. But others have said the most likely cause was a malfunction of a torpedo exploding in its tube. Navrotsky said that three more bodies were identified as Lt. Sergei Sadilenko, Lt. Rashid Aryapov and Warrant Officer Andrei Borisov. Four others, including Kolesnikov's, had already been identified.

Three days of talks between North Korea and the United States about North Korea's missile program ended Friday without conclusion in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, throwing into doubt the likelihood of a visit by President Clinton to North Korea. Administration officials said Friday that they had not expected an agreement at the sessions, which came on the heels of a trip to North Korea by Secretary of State Madeleine Albright. Even so, there now appears to be less enthusiasm for a presidential trip, and a White House official made plain Friday that Clinton would definitely not be going to North Korea at the tail end of his visit to Brunei and Vietnam later this month, as had been discussed. ``Whether the president goes is a function of what we think it would accomplish,'' a senior administration official said. ``If there are simply a bunch of vague assertions of what might happen _ that is not as compelling as if there were a significant set of understandings to be achieved.'' Because the issues in the talks are high-stake and complicated, questions were raised on Capitol Hill and among Asia experts about the wisdom of a trip to North Korea by a lameduck American president. There were also questions about whether there was enough time to complete such technical negotiations before Jan. 20. The United States is seeking a shutdown of missile research, development and testing by North Korea as well as an end to its exports of missiles and related technologies. The launch of a long-range missile by North Korea in 1998 was one of the factors that the Clinton administration said propelled it to plan a national missile defense system. Under discussion at the talks in Kuala Lumpur was a proposal under which North Korea would be able to launch civilian satellites on other nation's rockets, an idea that was explored by Albright and the North Korean leader, Kim Jung Il. No new talks were scheduled. Officials said the chief American negotiator at the talks, Robert Einhorn, who had been scheduled to go on to Beijing, would return home for extensive consultations. An array of Asia experts gathered by Albright for advice on North Korea at the State Department Thursday night generally agreed that a visit by Clinton as a lameduck president was probably not prudent, several participants said. ``It was clear to me this group would not want a presidential visit without a firm, unambiguous agreement _ at a minimum _ to bar development, research and testing of missiles and exports,'' said Lee H. Hamilton, who heads the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars. A panel of nonproliferation experts released a study this week opposing the idea of providing satellite launch facilities for North Korea. The panel, headed by Henry Sokolski, the executive director of the Nonproliferation Policy Education Center, said the know-how employed in launching a communications satellite could be adapted for military use.

An independent investigation into the past month's violence, reported on Friday, echoed many Palestinian accusations against Israel. Still, Palestinian officials criticized it for finding that one publicized Palestinian death was the result of a traffic accident, rather than a killing. A report by the Physicians for Human Rights, which is based in Boston, documents what it said was a pattern of the Israeli army shooting live bullets to wound and disperse unarmed rioters, a practice prohibited by army guidelines unless Israeli lives are at risk. But the Israeli army did not use exploding bullets or other internationally banned ammunition, as Palestinian officials have charged, according to the American forensic pathologists who conducted the investigation. An examination of hundreds of Palestinian casualties in October also found that scores were killed or badly injured by rubber-coated steel bullets fired at close range, another contravention of army rules, said the report. The Israeli army ``used live ammunition and rubber bullets excessively and inappropriately,'' the report said, charging that soldiers ``appeared to be shooting to inflict harm, rather than solely in self-defense.'' Yet while the investigation appeared to corroborate many Palestinian accusations against Israeli forces, its findings about one bitterly contested case were angrily dismissed by Palestinian officials and human rights activists. The death of Issam Judeh on Oct. 8 was the result of a traffic accident, as the Israeli army originally reported, rather than a killing by the Israeli army, as Palestinian officials asserted, according to the doctors. The doctors made an extensive study of photographic evidence, x-rays, hospital reports, Judeh's clothing and his damaged automobile. Judeh's death had been the most widely cited example in Palestinian media of a killing by Israeli settlers and soldiers. The Ramallah hospital where Judeh's body was brought announced that the body showed signs of brutal torture, including burns. Photographs of his disfigured corpse were given prominent play in Palestinian newspapers and television reports. Israeli and Palestinian officials said local anger over Judeh's death led to the mob deaths of two Israeli soldiers in Ramallah. Dr. Robert Kirshner and Dr. Nizam Peerwani, forensic pathologists who have conducted studies of torture deaths in Africa, the Balkans and Central America, said they found no indications of torture or burns. As is common in Muslim and Jewish culture, where burials traditionally take place shortly after death and marring the body is frowned upon, there was no autopsy, and the available evidence showed injuries consistent with an auto accident, the doctors said. Judeh's body had been found by his wife on a roadside near his damaged car. ``I don't think that the hospital was trying to mislead people,'' Kirshner said in a telephone interview from Chicago. ``I think it is because of ignorance of the injuries, the lack of forensic training. You see this all over the world. But what concerns me is that even after we told them it was an accident, some officials continued to portray it as a murder.'' Peerwani said in a telephone interview from Texas that he presented the conclusions personally to Muzer Sharif, the Palestinian deputy minister of health, who had announced that Judeh had been killed by Israelis. But Sharif said Friday night that without an autopsy, the pathologists' report was simply speculative. ``We are still committed to what we announced,'' Sharif said. ``We are fully convinced that he was killed as a result of torture.'' Separately, a private Palestinian human rights organization, LAW, sent copies of the photographs and medical records to a British forensic specialist, Dr. Christopher Milroy, who also concluded that Judeh died in a car accident. Abrasions had been misinterpreted by Ramallah doctors as burns, Milroy said. LAW, which also characterized the death as a slaying, has questioned Milroy's conclusion, as well as the new report by the Physicians for Human Rights. ''What we received is an opinion. It is not a report,'' said Khader Shkairat, LAW's director. ``We are still committed to the version that he was killed deliberately.'' The examination into Judeh's death was one part of a broader investigation that included a detailed analysis of 31 deaths over a 24-day period in Gaza, including that of 12-year-old Muhammed el-Dura, whose televised killing became a global symbol of the conflict. Like most of the dead in Gaza, the boy, shot in the chest and abdomen, was killed in Gaza's Netzarim junction by high-velocity bullets from an M16, the standard Israeli army rifle, the report said. Thirty-eight percent of the deaths were of children below the age of 18, and 14 percent were under 15, the report said. ``Obviously, this is not a genocide, but in a setting of civil violence this is a tremendous amount of casualties,'' said Peerwani, whose research in Bosnia and Rwanda has been used in war crimes prosecutions. The Boston human rights group said half of the fatal gunshots in the Gaza cases studied were to the head. The investigation was based primarily on local hospital records, including posthumous x-rays. ``Most Palestinian casualties were unfortunately shot in the upper body for the simple reason that they committed shootings and terrorist acts against Israeli solders and citizens,'' the Israeli army said in response to the report Friday night.

Weather on the Barents Sea improved Saturday and Russian and Norwegian divers resumed their search for bodies in the sunken nuclear submarine Kursk, a navy official said. The divers cut an opening in the inner hull over a compartment that served as the crew's living quarters, Northern Fleet spokesman Capt. Vadim Serga said. ``As weather reports predicted, surface conditions were much improved this morning at the site of the disaster,'' allowing the divers to resume their efforts to recover the bodies of the 118 sailors who died when the submarine exploded and sank Aug. 12, Serga said. He said the divers completed cutting a 4.8-inch opening in the inner hull. A larger hole would be cut later to give the divers access, he said. High winds and snow Friday forced divers' to halt efforts to recover bodies from the Kursk. So far, 12 bodies have been recovered, all from the submarine's stern. The divers moved their search toward less-damaged areas of the vessel Friday, after failing to enter a shattered third forward compartment. Before work was suspended Friday, Serga said they hoped to find more crew remains in the fourth compartment, which served as living quarters for the crew. The compartment held bunks, a kitchen and a room for meetings and social activity. At least 23 sailors in the submarine's stern survived the initial explosion, according to a letter found on the body of Lt. Dmitry Kolesnikov. Eight have been identified so far. The cause of the sinking remains unknown. Russian officials have theorized that the Kursk collided with a foreign submarine, setting off the powerful blasts. Others have suggested a technical malfunction caused a torpedo to explode in its tube.

Relatives of victims of the Singapore Airlines crash mourned at the charred wreckage of the jumbo jet on Saturday, some kneeling on the rain-soaked tarmac, as aviation experts struggled to understand how a veteran pilot could have tried taking off on a closed runway. Meanwhile, the airline announced that it would give $400,000 to the families of the passengers and crew who died when Flight SQ006 burst into flames while speeding down the airstrip filled with construction equipment. The crash killed 81 out of 179 people on board. Singapore Airlines earlier had offered $25,000 to the families of those who died and $5,000 to the injured. An airline spokeswoman said Saturday that the new $400,000 payment is separate from any earlier compensation. ``This is a very sad situation, and the airline hopes to help families through this terrible period by offering compensation without delay,'' the statement said. Wearing yellow plastic rain ponchos Saturday, some of the mourners in a group of about 100 people kneeled down on the tarmac as a steady drizzle fell at Chiang Kai-shek airport. Others prayed and stared at the heaps of metal that were once part of the Boeing 747-400 headed for Los Angeles. Investigators have said the jet crashed during a Tuesday night storm after the pilot mistakenly tried to take off on the closed runway and smashed into construction equipment, including concrete blocks and digging cranes. Officials said the crash probe was continuing and might take one or two years to complete. They declined to speculate about how the pilot could have made such an error and or say whether the closed runway should have been better marked. The strip had not been blocked off because it was frequently used by taxiing aircraft, said Chang Kuo-cheng, assistant director of Taiwan's Civil Aviation Administration. Closing down the entire runway would have created serious delays for planes lining up for departure, he said. Taiwan's aviation administration had warned airlines not to use the runway in an Aug. 31 letter and in reports given to the pilots during mandatory pre-flight briefings, Chang said. All international requirements were met in warning pilots about the runway, he said. The pilot was supposed to take off on the runway marked with a big red sign saying ''5L-23R,'' which was next to the closed runway, ''5R-23L.'' The runways were also marked with an ''05L'' and ''05R'' painted on the airstrip's surface. U.S. attorney Gerald Sterns, who specializes in representing air crash victims' families, said the airport might have been able to avoid confusion by altering the ''5R-23L'' sign on the repaired runway. The San Francisco lawyer said, ``The best defense is to put up a sign that says, `Runway Closed.' It's no big deal.'' He also said during big storms the control tower, which doesn't have ground radar, should use its radio to ask the warning pilots about the closed runway to make sure they aren't using it. The ``black box'' cockpit recorder indicated that wasn't done with the Singapore Airlines flight. But Chang said the airport's signs were in compliance with international regulations and the runways were properly marked. Others have speculated that, with visibility low because of the blustery winds and driving rain, the pilot saw a ''5'' on the sign and an ``L,'' while not noticing the other letters on the sign. Thinking he was on the correct runway, he took off. But Sean Peng, a spokesman with Taiwan's Civil Aviation Administration, said, although the signs might be confusing to the untrained, pilots are accustomed to deciphering the numbering systems, which are used internationally. ``Once professionals see the signs, they'll understand them,'' Peng said, who was perplexed by the pilot's mistake. Kay Yong, managing director of Taiwan's Aviation Safety Council, emphasized that it was too early to blame the crash on pilot error or describe the cause of the accident. Yong said that investigators were just laying out factual data. However, John Findlay, general secretary Hong Kong Aircrew Officers Association, said Taiwanese officials were too quick to announce their findings and that it may take months or years to find out what caused the pilot's error and what was happening on the plane at the time. ``We believe they need to go about it slowly, very slowly.''

Reporters accompanying Secretary of State Madeleine Albright on her recent trip to North Korea had no chance to see the rusted steelworks, the flooded mines or factories at a standstill. Nor were they able to see the small livestock markets that have sprung up in some parts of the country, testimony, apparently, of farmers' abandoning their collectives and taking matters into their own hands as a matter of sheer survival. But they were able to see that a major hospital had no lights except in the foyer and to hear about operations without anesthesia. They learned of the motto ``Children are king,'' and indeed, Albright saw _ and danced along with _ 5-and 6-year-olds who literally sang the praises of the North Korean leader, Kim Jung Il. Some 15 miles out of the capital, however, children labor on a road-building project, breaking stones by hand, a sight that recently reduced some toughened Western aid workers to tears. Even on a hasty two-day trip, it was clear there are only a few paradoxes in North Korea. The country is overwhelmingly poor, and its people are indoctrinated with a mixture of homegrown ideology focused on self-reliance and communist beliefs from the 1920s and '30s. In contrast to the United States' engagement with the Soviet Union and China, the Clinton administration has made clear that its objectives with North Korea do not include a makeover of the totalitarian regime into a democratic government with a market economy. The major goal is simply to coax Kim to get rid of his missiles and reduce the threat of war. Kim's goals seem equally limited. His country desperately needs help, and if North Korea takes the necessary steps to get off the State Department's list of countries that support terrorism _ which essentially revolves around what to do with three members of a terrorist group, the Japanese Red Army, who are wanted by Japan _ the regime will qualify for support from the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. But even given the modesty of each side's aspirations, if engagement continues, North Korea's people will inevitably come into more contact with the outside world. And that raises questions about how a nation as closed as North Korea will react. Certainly, contacts with the West will come as a shock. But for the moment, the North Korean regime most fears contact between its people and South Koreans, who enjoy a vastly more prosperous life and who in large numbers feel great emotional bonds to their Northern brethren. In the days before Albright arrived, North Korean officials forbade U.S. officials who drove over the demilitarized zone from South Korea to bring their South Korean drivers with them. All signs in English and emblems of South Korea affixed to the U.S. officials' cars had to be covered. But there is not the slightest hint that reunification along the model of East and West Germany is possible anytime soon. East Germany was far more porous than North Korea, where Kim has achieved an Orwellian thoroughness in keeping his people insulated _ all televisions and radios, which broadcast only government material, must be registered. What passes for broadcast news, largely the latest doings of the ``Dear Leader,'' is delivered in a harsh martial voice, and often over street loudspeakers, making it hard to ignore. Because self-sufficiency has been elevated by the state as the ultimate virtue and contrasts with modern prosperity have been shut out, there is little likelihood of immediate demand for the political and social change that brought revolution in the Soviet Union. Any kind of change is likely to come slowly. A few small ruptures in the seal around North Korea's people illustrate how glacial the pace of change may be. Five years ago, the State Department's desk officer for North Korea, Ken Quinones, accompanied by three other officials, landed in the country for an extremely delicate job: overseeing the removal of fuel rods from the Yongbyon reactor that contained enough plutonium for four or five nuclear bombs. The mission was to start the process of closing down the reactor under the terms agreed to between North Korea and the United States in 1994. The Americans, who were bunked at the top secret facility, were made to feel just what they were, Quinones said: enemies on enemy territory. They fought to get the tiniest freedom of movement. Only after agonizing negotiation did they win the right to go for a morning and evening walk to a tree, a quarter-mile outside the gate. (It helped that the tree happened to commemorate the founding leader of North Korea, Kim Il Sung, the current leader's father.) ``Everything was gradual and incremental, with profuse explanations every step of the way,'' said Quinones, who is now the head of Northeast Asia projects for Mercy Corps, a nongovernmental organization specializing in medical help for poor countries, including North Korea. One of the most interesting examples of interaction between North Koreans and outsiders is a joint effort between the government and the Nautilus Institute, a group based in Berkeley, Calif. Two years ago, on a farm west of Pyongyang, Nautilus installed windmills to generate energy for household lighting, a village water pump and a refrigerator in the village kindergarten. To Peter Hayes, the director of Nautilus, the project illustrates how stereotypes can, over time, be broken down. At first, he said, it was hard for the villagers to believe that the American technicians would return after the installation of the windmills, turbines and other equipment _ all of it imported, together with tools for assembling. When the Americans lived up to their promise and did return, some trust was established. Even so, Hayes said, it was hard to get villagers to allow the Americans to inspect their homes to see that the light bulbs initially installed were still working. But this suspicion broke down too. Hayes says he was not surprised when one of the North Koreans on the project told him, ``My mother thinks that all Americans are wolves, and we are the prey.'' But one North Korean showed great gratitude that his family was rescued from the darkness _ due to lack of oil and other energy sources _ that now blankets most of North Korea at night. The most rewarding words Hayes said he heard were from the man who said: ``Thank you, please come back and build more.''

By legend, this remote place nestled between the Arabian Sea and the black, crumpled mountains that form a shield against the vast deserts of Arabia is the land of the Queen of Sheba and the place fabled for the gold and frankincense and myrrh that the Wise Men carried to the manger where Jesus was born. Even today, more than 2,500 years after a civilization first flourished here, ancient mudbrick skyscrapers, amber-eyed men with short-tailed turbans and elusive, fast-walking women clothed head-to-toe in black shrouds and tall, conical straw hats lend the landscape a pervasive air of mystery. It was into this world, ancient and unchanging, that agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation stepped two weeks ago. What drew them was not a way of life that has fascinated generations of Arabists, anthropologists and explorers. Rather, they were probing the links between this fastness of low-lying mountains and Osama bin Laden, the self-proclaimed leader of an Islamic ``holy war'' against the United States, who is considered a prime suspect in organizing or at least inspiring the bombing of the destroyer Cole in Aden harbor on Oct. 12 that killed 17 American sailors. The two men who spent four months staking out the American warships entering Aden harbor _ thought to be the same two who loaded a skiff with a high explosives and blew a gaping hole in one of the world's most sophisticated warships _ spoke with accents that identified them as natives of Hadhramaut, this province in eastern Yemen that contains the bin Laden's ancestral village, Al-Rubat. It was from that hilltop village that Muhammad bin Laden, Osama's father, migrated in the 1950s to Saudi Arabia, where he formed close ties with the ruling Saud dynasty and accumulated a billion-dollar fortune building roads and palaces and trading real estate. Though the 43-year-old Osama bin Laden, the 17th of more than 50 children born to his father, never lived in Wadi Doan and now makes his headquarters in the isolated mountain caves and desert hideouts of Afghanistan, he absorbed his fundamentalist views on Islam from the strict Wahhabi form of Muslim beliefs that is prevalent in this region. And it is here, in Wadi Doan, that some of the clues to his character _ as well as to the bombing of the Cole _ may lie. FBI officials have said they have only suppositional evidence linking bin Laden to the Cole attack, but the agency believes from probes into at least a half-dozen major terrorist attacks on American targets in the past decade that Wadi Doan and similarly remote places in Yemen's hinterland have served as strongholds for a variety of Islamic terrorist groups with links to bin Laden. One way and another, the FBI has established links between these Yemeni redoubts and several of the worst Islamic terrorist attacks on American targets, including the bombing of two American embassies in East Africa that killed 242 people and wounded about 5,000 in August 1998 and the World Trade Center bombing in New York in 1993 that killed six people and injured 1,000. Altogether, more than a dozen major attacks on American targets in the Middle East, Europe and elsewhere over the past decade _ including an attack on an Aden hotel in 1992 that was aimed at American soldiers, but missed them, killing two Yemenis _ have been linked to groups with ties to bin Laden. Now, the FBI's investigation into the Cole bombing has led them back to Wadi Doan. Beyond the accents of the two men suspected in the attack, the FBI also suspects that bin Laden, under pressure from the Taliban rulers of Afghanistan, who have been subjected to U.N. trade sanctions for harboring him, gave a number of hints shortly before the Cole attack that he was renewing links to his family's ancestral home, possibly as a prelude to seeking a new sanctuary in Yemen. For one thing, the 6-foot-3-inch bin Laden, in a videotape secretly delivered to a television station in the Persian Gulf state of Qatar and broadcast from there throughout the Middle East on Sept. 22, wore traditional Hadhrami dress, with a curved dagger at his belt, as he delivered a fresh tirade against the United States and new threats to attack American targets in the Arabian peninsula. For another, Al-Quds, a London-based Arab-language newspaper with a history of solid reporting on bin Laden's activities, reported recently that, following strict Islamic tradition, bin Laden had held a lavish wedding feast in the Afghan city of Kandahar and married, as his fourth wife, a 17-year-old girl from a prominent Hadramaut family. Bin Laden's ancestral village, Al-Rubat, lies about 1,350 miles from the deserts and mountains of eastern and southern Afghanistan where he now hides, since quitting his previous base in Sudan under growing FBI pressure in the early 1990s. But the remote Wadi Doan is redolent of many things that appear to have fed into bin Laden's character and his battle against America _ including a profound Islamic faith that has evolved little in a millennium, a deeply frugal lifestyle, and a passion for secrecy and conspiracy in the face of all things alien or unfamiliar. Though bin Laden grew up in the Saudi Arabian city of Jiddah, about 700 miles away across the Arabian peninsula, those who know him say he remains every bit a Hadhrami _ as the people of this remote region of eastern Yemen are known _ among other things intensely clannish, and just as intensely conservative in their adherence to strict forms of Islam. ``He is a very good man, a very honest man, a very devout man,'' said Jafr Ahmed, a man in his 70s with cracked spectacles who sat on a stoop in the hilltop fastness of Al Hajrayn, smoking a hookah pipe fashioned from an old oil can and a length of rubber hose. Ahmed, who worked as a jackhammer operator for the bin Laden's company in Saudi Arabia for 35 years, added, ``Father and son both, they were kind, they were true to Islam.'' Those around here who knew his father say the key to Osama bin Laden's character _ his shrewdness and singularity of purpose, his deeply conservative religious and political views, his profound distaste for non-Islamic influences that have penetrated some of the most remote corners of old Arabia, even the cunning tradecraft he has used in his meticulously planned attacks _ lies in the unrelenting traditions of the Hadhrami. One of the investigative breaks that brought the FBI to Hadhramaut within days of the Cole bombing was the discovery that one of the presumed bombers, who called himself Abdullah Ahmed Khaled Musawah and wore the thick, bushy beard favored among the devout in Islam, carried a driver's license and other documents identifying him as a Hadhramaut native. The other man, slight and goateed, rarely spoke to those who met him in the steep, cloistering alleyways above Aden harbor, before the two men disappeared for the last time at dawn on the day of bombing. But neighbors said that the second man also spoke with a thick Hadhrami accent, in his case spiced with the linguistic influences of Saudi Arabia and the Persian Gulf. As Hadhramis, the suspected bombers came from a world that could scarcely be more different from the one inhabited by the Americans who sent the Cole into Aden to begin refueling stops in the Yemeni port despite years of warnings that Yemen offered a haven for Islamic terrorists. (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) In these broad valleys, where the rivers dried up in times immemorial, becoming shallow streams only during the August rains, the distant world has not been wholly shut out. For one thing, the poverty that set in centuries ago _ when the collapse of the Roman Empire caused a decline in the frankincense trade and newer civilizations turned increasingly to other, cheaper fragrances available closer at hand _ has made wanderers of the Hadhrami people. With little to sustain them here, and the maritime traditions born of living on the Arabian Sea, Hadhramis began dispersing to places as distant as Java, the Malaccas and the great port cities of India. During the first big Middle Eastern oil boom in the 1950s, the migration shifted to Saudi Arabia and the Persian Gulf. It was this migration that carried Osama bin Laden's father, Muhammad, and several brothers, to Saudi Arabia, where they parlayed their Hadhrami frugality and shrewdness into a vast fortune that left Osama bin Laden, after his father died when he was still in his teens, with a personal wealth Saudi acquaintances of the bin Ladens have estimated at $300 million, perhaps even more. On their travels, Hadhramis took with them special skills, especially in construction techniques developed over the millennia in building the distinctive mud skyscrapers in which most Hadhramis live. When they returned, as many did once they had made enough money to sustain their families, they brought back vestiges of foreign influence. In recent years, for example, virtually every home in their mud skyscrapers has satellite television that has made Hadhramis enthusiastic watchers of Egyptian movies, and Lebanese game shows, and of other light entertainment originating still farther afield, in Europe and the United States. But the basic Hadhrami qualities _ Islamic devoutness, grinding thrift, and, above all, an abiding wariness of foreigners and anything alien to Islam _ have endured. So, too, has an even narrower exclusiveness towards Arabs and Muslims from much closer at hand, a trait sociologists have said is particularly marked in Wadi Doan, the stoney valley that runs down toward the Arabian sea from a point south of the Empty Quarter. For most Hadhrami, this means never discussing with a stranger anything of political or religious importance, and certainly nothing to do with the bombing of the Cole. ``I have no right to ask you anything, and you have no right to ask me _ this way, we both can be happy,'' said Jamal Ahmed, a 40-year-old seller of stationery, backing away from a visitor to his shop in Al Hajrayn to engage in a self-conscious dusting of his array of pencils, notebooks and erasers. It was this culture that the bin Ladens carried with them on their travels and made Hadhramaut, for Osama bin Laden, an ideal base when he began in the early 1990s, from his headquarters in Afghanistan, to develop the terrorist diaspora he has used in his self-proclaimed ``holy war'' against the United States and the ruling dynasties in the Persian Gulf that are its allies. As Yemen's government discovered after it united the country in a bitter civil war in 1994, the writ of any law but the Koran's, and the local landlords' and tribal leaders', does not run deep. (END OPTIONAL TRIM) In the distinctive citadels they have built on the rocky hills that flank the valley, Hadhramis tolerate the groups of intrepid tourists, mostly from France and Germany, who wander the narrow streets. As long as questions relate to matters of tradition and lifestyle, of the skills used in the bee-keeping, goat-herding and subsistence farming that provide much of what little there is in local employment _ and as long as no one, particularly no Western man, attempts to speak to the shrouded women who scurry past along narrow alleyways _ Hadhramis are friendly, if not exactly exuberant in their attitude toward outsiders. But once the talk shifts to topics even vaguely related to politics, much less anything as potentially explosive as the use of Hadhramaut as an Islamic terrorist bastion, shutters go up quickly. Ali Omar Bahareish, a trader selling honeycombs opposite the mosque in the hilltop citadel of Al Hajrayn, about 20 miles north of the bin Laden family's native village at Al Rubat, chatted easily for an hour about his 35 years as a construction worker in Saudi Arabia, some of it working for the bin Laden family company that now has projects throughout the Middle East. Like many Yemenis, and even most of the people approached in the ancient citadels that crowd every hilltop in Wadi Doan, Bahareish said he was sorry for the sailors who died aboard the Cole, and sorry, too, for the people of Hadhramaut, since the bombing would further discourage the tourism that also adds to what little local economy there is. But he had scarcely had a chance to say even that before a Yemeni government ``minder'' assigned to accompany this reporter and a crew from ABC television's ``Prime Time'' leapt to his feet from the alcove where he had been dozing and ordered the honey-seller to shut up. ``Don't talk about that, nothing, not a word, nothing about bin Laden,'' said the minder, in an angry whisper, glowering through his dark glasses, before moving from the alcove to a position a half-dozen paces away where he could monitor the conversation even more carefully.

Families of people killed in the Singapore Airlines crash in Taiwan will each be offered $400,000, the airline said Saturday, a sum more than five times the amount the company is required to give in liability cases. Under a steady drizzle, four busloads of victims' relatives were taken Saturday to the crash site at Chiang Kai-shek airport outside Taipei, where some kneeled down and prayed, while others just stared at the heaps of metal that were once part of the Los Angeles-bound plane. The compensation announcement came a day after the investigators said that the pilot of Flight SQ006 mistakenly took off Tuesday night on a closed runway filled with construction equipment, including digging cranes and concrete blocks. After colliding with objects on the airstrip, the Boeing 747-400 burst into flames and split into three pieces, killing 81 of the 179 people on board during bad weather caused by an approaching typhoon. The airline had already offered $25,000 to the families of those who died and $5,000 to the injured to cover any immediate costs. The new $400,000 payment is separate from any earlier compensation. ``This is a very sad situation, and the airline hopes to help families through this terrible period by offering compensation without delay,'' the company said in a statement. All claims stemming from international air travel are governed by the Warsaw Convention, which imposes a $75,000 per passenger limit on liability. Families can seek more if the air carrier is engaged in willful misconduct, such as breached security or poor maintenance. Before last week's accident, Singapore Airlines had never had a deadly crash in its 28-year history. In 1997, a plane operated by its subsidiary, SilkAir, crashed in Indonesia, killing 104 passengers and crew members. The airline offered families $200,000 per victim in the SilkAir accident. On Friday, Cheong Choong Kong, deputy chairman and chief executive of Singapore Airlines, said the company accepted ``full responsibility'' for the crash. Officials said the crash probe was continuing and might take one or two years to complete. They declined to speculate about how the pilot could have made such an error or say whether the closed runway should have been better marked. The strip had not been blocked off because it was frequently used by taxiing aircraft, said Chang Kuo-cheng, assistant director of Taiwan's Civil Aviation Administration. Closing down the entire runway would have created serious delays for planes lining up for departure, he said. Taiwan's aviation authorities had warned airlines not to use the runway in an Aug. 31 letter and in reports given to the pilots during mandatory preflight briefings, Chang said. All international requirements were met in warning pilots about the runway, Chang said. The pilot was supposed to take off on the runway marked with a big red sign saying ''5L-23R.'' The strip was next to the closed runway, ''5R-23L.'' The runways were also marked with an ''05L'' and ''05R'' painted on the airstrip's surface. American attorney Gerald Sterns, who specializes in representing air crash victims' families, said the airport might have been able to avoid confusion by altering the ''5R-23L'' sign on the repaired runway. ``The best defense is to put up a sign that says, `Runway Closed.' It's no big deal,'' the San Francisco-based lawyer said. He also said that during big storms the control tower, which doesn't have ground radar, should use its radio to warn pilots about the closed runway to make sure they aren't using it. The ``black box'' cockpit recorder indicated that wasn't done with the Singapore Airlines flight. But Chang said the airport's signs were in compliance with international regulations and the runways were properly marked. Others have speculated that, with visibility low because of the blustery winds and driving rain, the pilot saw a ''5'' on the sign and an ``L,'' while not noticing the other letters and numbers on the sign. Thinking he was on the correct runway, he took off. But Sean Peng, a spokesman with Taiwan's Civil Aviation Administration, said that although the signs might be confusing to the untrained, pilots are accustomed to deciphering the numbering systems, which are used internationally. The Singapore Airlines' pilot had been to the airport 10 times before the crash. ``Once professionals see the signs, they'll understand them,'' said Peng. Kay Yong, managing director of Taiwan's Aviation Safety Council, emphasized that it was too early to blame the crash on pilot error or to describe the cause of the accident. Yong said that investigators were just laying out factual data. However, John Findlay, general secretary of the Hong Kong Aircrew Officers Association, said Taiwanese officials were too quick to announce details of the investigation. He said it may take months or years to find out what caused the pilot's error and what was happening on the plane at the time. ``We believe they need to go about it slowly, very slowly.'' he said.

Coils of barbed wire close an opening in a wall around the shack that suspects in the USS Cole bombing allegedly used to prepare a small boat for its deadly mission. A scrawny camel chewing on rotting fruit was the only presence near the shack on a recent afternoon. The security agents who had swarmed the area following the Oct. 12 bombing of the destroyer are gone. The Cole has disappeared from Aden's harbor; life is returning to normal around the houses and locations thought to have connected to the blast. But despite promising leads, the mystery of the worst strike on the U.S. military since 1996 has yet to be unraveled. Some experts believe the Cole explosion has ushered in a period of heightened danger, with a possibility of additional anti-U.S. and anti-Israel attacks in the Middle East. That is partly because of continued tension in Israel and the Palestinian territories. The United States is perceived as backing Israel in the crisis that erupted Sept. 28, a perception fueling cravings for revenge and punishment against Americans. ``This is just the tip of the iceberg,'' said Vince Cannistraro, a former CIA counterterrorism expert. ``We're going to see a whole series of suicide bombings ... over the next months or so.'' Cannistraro said attacks would not be of the Cole scale, but rather smaller and more spontaneous, especially around the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, a time of more religious fervor. Ramadan begins in late November. There has been no responsibility claim considered credible in the strike on the Cole. American officials have said Osama bin Laden _ America's No. 1 terror suspect who has pledged to drive the U.S. military out of the Middle East _ is a focus of the bombing investigation. The Saudi millionaire is accused of masterminding the 1998 bombings on U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. Yemenis have rounded up some senior members of Islamic Jihad, a group formed by veterans of the Afghan war against the Soviets in the 1980s that has ties to bin Laden. President Ali Abdullah Saleh has said one of the suspects is Egyptian. Two detainees allegedly took part in preparing for attacks in December 1993 on two hotels frequented by foreigners in which an Austrian and a janitor were killed. Officials and diplomats at the time blamed Muslim fundamentalists angered by Yemen's support for the U.S.-led relief operation in Somalia. Preparations for the bombing are believed to have started in March. Around that time, a man went to the naval police base to register a white boat using a fake identification card issued in Lahej, an Islamic Jihad stronghold 22 miles north of Aden. When the man was asked to produce the boat for inspection, he said it was being repaired and led police to the shack where the boat allegedly was fitted with explosives. Investigators believe four people plotted the Cole bombing and, like members of well-run terrorist groups, they didn't reveal the whole plan to their helpers. A carpenter who rented out the shack in Madinat Ash-Shaab neighborhood apparently helped the men weld linings for explosives into the boat and had seen them bring explosives into the cinderblock room with blue shutters. But the carpenter told investigators he didn't know what the men had planned to do with the explosives and that they repeatedly had told him to mind his own business. A Somali-born woman who had bought the car that towed the boat also told investigators the suspects gave her money to make the purchase, but she said she had no idea it was to be part of a bomb plot. A network inside and outside Yemen provided the men with practical support _ identification cards and money. Phone records show the suspects made collect calls to Gulf countries and received money from those places in the form of transfers to local exchange bureaus. Authorities are looking for paperwork relating to four identification cards, at least one of them fake, issued between 1996 and 1997 that has disappeared from government files. Most of those detained have been released. However, the carpenter, the Somali-born woman, four Islamists detained in Lahej and several civil servants from the Lahej office that issued the identification card remained in custody Friday. The United States is pressing Yemeni authorities leading the probe to allow U.S. agents a greater role in the investigation, and there are reports the two sides are about to reach a compromise where the Americans would be present during the interrogation of sources and suspects. Cannistraro said if Yemeni investigators find proof bin Laden was behind the attack, President Saleh would not shy away from naming him ``because it's a foreign, not Yemeni'' operation. ``But if they find that there was support to the operation from Yemenis themselves in the country, that would be a little bit embarrassing. They might try to conceal that,'' he said.

By legend, this remote fastness nestled between the Arabian Sea and the black, crumpled mountains that form a shield against the vast deserts of Arabia is the land of the Queen of Sheba and the place fabled for the gold and frankincense and myrrh that the Wise Men carried to the manger where Jesus was born. Even today, more than 2,500 years after a civilization first flourished here, ancient mudbrick skyscrapers, amber-eyed men with short-tailed turbans and elusive, fast-walking women clothed head-to-toe in black shrouds and tall, conical straw hats lend the landscape a pervasive air of mystery. It was into this world, ancient and unchanging in essential ways, that agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation stepped two weeks ago. What drew them was not a way of life that has fascinated generations of Arabists, anthropologists and explorers. Rather, they were probing the links between this region of low-lying mountains and Osama bin Laden, the self-proclaimed leader of an Islamic ``holy war'' against the United States, who is considered a prime suspect in organizing or at least inspiring the bombing of the destroyer Cole on Oct. 12 that killed 17 American sailors. The two men who spent four months staking out American warships entering Aden harbor _ thought to be the same two who loaded a skiff with a high explosives and blew a gaping hole in one of the world's most sophisticated warships _ spoke with accents that identified them as natives of Hadhramaut, this province in eastern Yemen that is home to bin Laden's ancestral village, Al-Rubat. It was from that hilltop village that Muhammad bin Laden, Osama's father, migrated in the 1950s to Saudi Arabia, where he formed close ties with the ruling Saud dynasty and accumulated a billion-dollar fortune building roads and palaces and trading real estate. Though the 43-year-old Osama bin Laden, the 17th of more than 50 children born to his father, never lived in Wadi Doan and now makes his headquarters in the isolated mountain caves and desert hideouts of Afghanistan, he absorbed his fundamentalist views on Islam from the strict Wahhabi form of Muslim beliefs that is prevalent in this region. And it is here, in Wadi Doan, that some of the clues to his character _ as well as to the bombing of the Cole _ may lie. FBI officials have said they have only suppositional evidence linking bin Laden to the Cole attack, but the agency believes from probes into at least a half-dozen major terrorist attacks on American targets in the past decade that Wadi Doan and similarly remote places in Yemen's hinterland have served as strongholds for a variety of Islamic terrorist groups with links to bin Laden. One way and another, the FBI has established links between these Yemeni redoubts and several of the worst Islamic terrorist attacks on American targets, including the bombing of two American embassies in East Africa that killed 242 people and wounded about 5,000 in August 1998 and the World Trade Center bombing in New York in 1993 that killed six people and injured 1,000. Altogether, more than a dozen major attacks on American targets in the Middle East, Europe and elsewhere over the past decade _ including an attack on an Aden hotel in 1992 that was aimed at American soldiers, but missed them, killing two Yemenis _ have been linked to groups with ties to bin Laden. Now, the FBI's investigation into the Cole bombing has led them back to Wadi Doan. Beyond the accents of the two men suspected in the attack, the FBI also believes that bin Laden, under pressure from the Taliban rulers of Afghanistan, who have been subjected to U.N. trade sanctions for harboring him, gave a number of hints shortly before the Cole attack that he was renewing links to his family's ancestral home, possibly as a prelude to seeking a new sanctuary in Yemen. For one thing, the 6-foot-3-inch bin Laden, in a videotape secretly delivered to a television station in the Persian Gulf state of Qatar and broadcast from there throughout the Middle East on Sept. 22, wore traditional Hadhrami dress, with a curved dagger at his belt, as he delivered a fresh tirade against the United States and new threats to attack American targets in the Arabian peninsula. For another, Al-Quds, a London-based Arab-language newspaper with a history of solid reporting on bin Laden's activities, reported recently that, following strict Islamic tradition, bin Laden had held a lavish wedding feast in the Afghan city of Kandahar and married, as his fourth wife, a 17-year-old girl from a prominent Hadhramaut family. Bin Laden's ancestral village, Al-Rubat, lies about 1,350 miles from the deserts and mountains of eastern and southern Afghanistan where he now hides, since quitting his previous base in Sudan under growing FBI pressure in the early 1990s. But the remote Wadi Doan is redolent of many things that appear to have fed into bin Laden's character and his battle against America _ including a profound Islamic faith that has evolved little in a millennium, a deeply frugal lifestyle, and a passion for secrecy and conspiracy in the face of all things alien or unfamiliar. Though bin Laden grew up in the Saudi Arabian city of Jiddah, about 700 miles away across the Arabian peninsula, those who know him say he remains every bit a Hadhrami _ as the people of this remote region of eastern Yemen are known _ among other things intensely clannish, and just as intensely conservative in their adherence to strict forms of Islam. ``He is a very good man, a very honest man, a very devout man,'' said Jafr Ahmed, a man in his 70s with cracked spectacles who sat on a stoop in the hilltop fastness of Al Hajrayn, smoking a hookah pipe fashioned from an old oil can and a length of rubber hose. Ahmed, who worked as a jackhammer operator for the bin Laden's company in Saudi Arabia for 35 years, added, ``Father and son both, they were kind, they were true to Islam.'' Those around here who knew his father say the key to Osama bin Laden's character _ his shrewdness and singularity of purpose, his deeply conservative religious and political views, his profound distaste for non-Islamic influences that have penetrated some of the most remote corners of old Arabia, even the cunning tradecraft he has used in his meticulously planned attacks _ lies in the unrelenting traditions of the Hadhrami. One of the investigative breaks that brought the FBI to Hadhramaut within days of the Cole bombing was the discovery that one of the presumed bombers, who called himself Abdullah Ahmed Khaled Musawah and wore the thick, bushy beard favored among the devout in Islam, carried a driver's license and other documents identifying him as a Hadhramaut native. The other man, slight and goateed, rarely spoke to those who met him in the steep, cloistering alleyways above Aden harbor, before the two men disappeared for the last time at dawn on the day of bombing. But neighbors said that the second man also spoke with a thick Hadhrami accent, in his case spiced with the linguistic influences of Saudi Arabia and the Persian Gulf. As Hadhramis, the suspected bombers came from a world that could scarcely be more different from the one inhabited by the Americans who sent the Cole into Aden for the 25th in a series of refueling stops that began in 1999, disregarding years of CIA and State Department warnings that Yemen offered a haven for Islamic terrorists. (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) In these broad valleys, where the rivers dried up in times immemorial, becoming shallow streams only during the August rains, the distant world has not been wholly shut out. For one thing, the poverty that set in centuries ago _when the collapse of the Roman Empire caused a decline in the frankincense trade and newer civilizations turned increasingly to other, cheaper fragrances available closer at hand _ has made wanderers of the Hadhrami people. With little to sustain them here, and the maritime traditions born of living on the Arabian Sea, Hadhramis began dispersing to places as distant as Java, the Malaccas and the great port cities of India. During the first big Middle Eastern oil boom in the 1950s, the migration shifted to Saudi Arabia and the Persian Gulf. It was this migration that carried Osama bin Laden's father, Muhammad, and several brothers, to Saudi Arabia, where they parlayed their Hadhrami frugality and shrewdness into a vast fortune that left Osama bin Laden, after his father died when he was still in his teens, with a personal wealth Saudi acquaintances of the bin Ladens have estimated at $300 million, perhaps even more. On their travels, Hadhramis took with them special skills, especially in construction techniques developed over the millennia in building the distinctive mud skyscrapers in which most Hadhramis live. When they returned, as many did once they had made enough money to sustain their families, they brought back vestiges of foreign influence. In recent years, for example, virtually every home in their mud skyscrapers has satellite television that has made Hadhramis enthusiastic watchers of Egyptian movies, and Lebanese game shows, and of other light entertainment originating still farther afield, in Europe and the United States. But the basic Hadhrami qualities _ Islamic devoutness, grinding thrift, and, above all, an abiding wariness of foreigners and anything alien to Islam _ have endured. So, too, has an even narrower exclusiveness towards Arabs and Muslims from much closer at hand, a trait sociologists have said is particularly marked in Wadi Doan, the stoney valley that runs down toward the Arabian sea from a point south of the Empty Quarter. For most Hadhrami, this means never discussing with a stranger anything of political or religious importance, and certainly nothing to do with the bombing of the Cole. ``I have no right to ask you anything, and you have no right to ask me _ this way, we both can be happy,'' said Jamal Ahmed, a 40-year-old seller of stationery, backing away from a visitor to his shop in Al Hajrayn to engage in a self-conscious dusting of his array of pencils, notebooks and erasers. It was this culture that the bin Ladens carried with them on their travels and made Hadhramaut, for Osama bin Laden, an ideal base when he began in the early 1990s, from his headquarters in Afghanistan, to develop the terrorist diaspora he has used in his self-proclaimed ``holy war'' against the United States and the ruling dynasties in the Persian Gulf that are its allies. As Yemen's government discovered after it united the country in a bitter civil war in 1994, the writ of any law but the Koran's, and the local landlords' and tribal leaders', does not run deep. (END OPTIONAL TRIM) In the distinctive citadels they have built on the rocky hills that flank the valley, Hadhramis tolerate the groups of intrepid tourists, mostly from France and Germany, who wander the narrow streets. As long as questions relate to matters of tradition and lifestyle, of the skills used in the bee-keeping, goat-herding and subsistence farming that provide much of what little there is in local employment _ and as long as no one, particularly no Western man, attempts to speak to the shrouded women who scurry past along narrow alleyways _ Hadhramis are friendly, if not exactly exuberant in their attitude toward outsiders. But once the talk shifts to topics even vaguely related to politics, especially anything as potentially explosive as the use of Hadhramaut as an Islamic terrorist bastion, shutters go up quickly. Ali Omar Bahareish, a trader selling honeycombs opposite the mosque in the hilltop citadel of Al Hajrayn, about 20 miles north of the bin Laden family's native village at Al Rubat, chatted easily for an hour about his 35 years as a construction worker in Saudi Arabia, some of it working for the bin Laden family company that now has projects throughout the Middle East. Like many Yemenis, and even most of the people approached in the ancient citadels that crowd every hilltop in Wadi Doan, Bahareish said he was sorry for the sailors who died aboard the Cole, and sorry, too, for the people of Hadhramaut, since the bombing would further discourage the tourism that also adds to what little local economy there is. But he had scarcely had a chance to say even that before a Yemeni government ``minder'' assigned to accompany this reporter and a crew from ABC television's ``Prime Time'' leapt to his feet from the alcove where he had been dozing and ordered the honey-seller to shut up. ``Don't talk about that, nothing, not a word, nothing about bin Laden,'' said the minder, in an angry whisper, glowering through his dark glasses, before moving from the alcove to a position a half-dozen paces away where he could monitor the conversation even more carefully.

Officials have identified 10 of the 12 bodies recovered from the sunken nuclear submarine Kursk as Russian and Norwegian divers Saturday resumed their search for more bodies, a navy official said. The divers Saturday afternoon completed cutting a hole in the inner hull over the fourth compartment in the vessel's forward area, Northern Fleet spokesman Capt. Igor Babenko said. High winds and snow later Friday forced a temporary halt to divers' efforts to recover bodies from the Kursk, but they were able on Saturday to resume their efforts to recover the bodies of the 118 sailors who died when the submarine exploded and sank Aug. 12. The divers moved their search for bodies toward less damaged areas of the vessel on Friday, after failing to enter a shattered third forward compartment. After the hole was cut into the fourth compartment, divers circulated water to disperse the murk in the compartment and prepared to take in television equipment, navy spokesman Capt. Valdimir Navrotsky said on RTR television. Another navy spokesman, Capt. Vadim Serga, said divers hoped to find more crew remains in the fourth compartment, which served as living quarters for the crew. The compartment held bunks, a kitchen and a room for meetings and social activity. Twelve bodies have been recovered so far, all of them from the submarine's stern. Of the 12, 10 had been identified as of Saturday, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported. The identities of the two others was expected to be established later Saturday, the news agency said. At least 23 sailors survived the initial explosion in the submarine's stern, as indicated by a letter found on the body of Lt. Dmitry Kolesnikov. The cause of the Kursk's sinking remains unknown. Russian officials favor a theory that a collision with a foreign submarine set off the powerful blasts. But others have said the most likely reason was a torpedo exploding in its tube because of a technical malfunction. A state commission of inquiry into the sinking of the Kursk will convene in Moscow on Wednesday, the Interfax news agency reported. It said that the diving operation will be completed by the end of next week.

The closed-door trial of accused U.S. spy Edmond Pope resumed Saturday after doctors said he was well enough to continue to be tried, but his lawyer said the medical examination had been conducted improperly. Pope had suffered bone cancer that was in remission when he came to Moscow, but his family and attorney repeatedly have expressed concern that it could have re-emerged since his April 3 arrest. The court has denied several requests for Pope to be examined by English-speaking doctors. Pope suffered two bouts of back and joint pain this week, forcing his trial to be suspended Friday. The news agency Interfax cited a doctor at the Lefortovo prison, where Pope is incarcerated, as saying that Pope was examined Friday at the presidential medical clinic, one of Russia's top facilities, and that there was no sign of the bone cancer returning. Pope's lawyer, Pavel Astakhov, said the court had received no documents about the medical examination and had not been informed of where or how the examination had been conducted. He said that violated judicial procedure. Prison doctors previously diagnosed the cause of Pope's pain as osteochondrosis, a form of arthritis, and rheumatic inflammation of the back and hip joints, Astakhov said. But he claimed that they lacked the equipment or expertise to make an accurate diagnosis. Russia's Federal Security Service arrested Pope on suspicion of trying to illegally buy plans for a secret high-speed torpedo used by the Russian navy. Pope has pleaded innocent, and his supporters say the plans were for 10-year-old technology that has already been sold abroad. Pope, 54, a retired U.S. Navy officer from State College, Pa., had worked for the Applied Research Laboratory at Pennsylvania State University. He later founded CERF Technologies International, a company specializing in studying foreign maritime equipment. During the closed-door trial on Saturday, the court received written testimony from Valdimir Ivashkov, a professor at Moscow's Bauman Technical College, saying documents given to Pope about the torpedo contained only non-classified information. Ivashkov was responsible for tests on the torpedo's engine, Astakhov said. Astakhov also was quoted by Russian media as saying that Pope's request to vote in the U.S. presidential elections on Tuesday was denied. Astakhov argued that Pope had a right to cast his vote at the U.S. embassy, but Russian officials said nobody could be allowed to leave Lefortovo on Tuesday because it is a Russian holiday. Oleg Plotnikov, the state prosecutor, said in a newspaper interview published Saturday that Pope was a career intelligence officer who was attempting to purchase the manufacturing technology, which is secret. Plotnikov said, ``the fact that the U.S. Congress, Secretary of State (Madeleine) Albright and (President) Clinton himself are giving Pope so much attention makes one wonder whether the man is just the owner of a company employing as few as three or four personnel.'' Astakhov said Pope has been barred from taking his medication. Russian regulations bar outside supplies of medicines to inmates, and prison officials refused to allow Pope's wife, Cheri, to give him his American medicines when she visited him last week. Pope's supporters say they have little hope of a fair trial or acquittal.

Iraq resumed domestic flights to the towns of Basra and Mosul on Sunday in defiance of no-fly zones enforced by U.S. and British warplanes since shortly after the 1991 Gulf War, the official Iraqi News Agency reported. Two Russian-made military cargo planes carrying passengers took off from Baghdad at 1 p.m., the agency reported. It did not say how many passengers were on the two flights. During the Gulf War, Iraq moved its 15 Boeing airliners to Jordan, Iran and Tunisia to escape bombing. They remain there. In Egypt, Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf said after meeting President Hosni Mubarak that ``these flights will continue despite the threats, since the aim of these flights is to destroy the American-British criminal act by imposing the no-fly zones.'' Iraqi Airways, the country's national carrier, charges $13 per passenger to Basra, 343 miles south of Baghdad, and $11 per passenger to Mosul, 250 miles north of the capital. ``It is the first domestic flight since the vicious 30-state aggression on Iraq in a challenge to the hostile measure imposed by the American and British administrations,'' INA said. The ''30-state aggression'' is the phrase used by the official Iraqi media to refer to the U.S.-led, multinational force that evicted the Iraqi army from Kuwait in the Gulf War. The U.S. military says Iraqi military planes have frequently violated the zones with quick in-and-out forays since December 1998, when Iraq began challenging the allied planes. Under the no-fly arrangements, the Iraqi military is not allowed to fly fixed-wing aircraft or helicopters into the zone areas, but there was no word on Sunday on whether Iraq gave Britain and the United States advance notice of the domestic flights. The resumption of domestic flights follows the arrival in Baghdad of dozens of international flights from non-governmental organizations and foreign countries seeking an end to U.N. sanctions imposed to punish Iraq for invading Kuwait in 1990. The U.S. State Department warned Friday that foreign aircraft flying into Iraq should avoid the no-fly zones because of ``aggressive Iraqi activities'' in these areas. Spokesman Richard Boucher said aircraft flying anywhere in Iraq could face danger but that the no-fly zones are of a particular concern. But Boucher stopped short of saying whether the U.S. and British warplanes policing the zones will intercept Iraqi passenger planes. U.S. and British jets have been patrolling the skies over northern and southern Iraq for nearly a decade, arguing that the no-fly zones are needed to protect Kurdish and Shiite Muslim minorities from Iraqi forces. Iraq says the zones violate its sovereignty and international law. As part of its challenges to the zones in the past two years, Iraq has been firing missiles and anti-aircraft artillery at the U.S. and British warplanes.

Iran's president may boycott an important Islamic summit in Qatar this month to protest that country's commercial ties with Israel, a senior official in the Iranian president's office said Sunday. Mohammad Khatami, who currently holds the rotating presidency of the Organization of the Islamic Conference, is seeking to pressure Qatar to sever economic ties with Israel by threatening to send a lower-level delegation to the summit, the official said by telephone from Tehran. The Palestinian issue and relations with Israel will top the agenda of the Nov. 12-14 summit, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. Qatar is the only Gulf Arab state to maintain commercial ties with Israel. Oman severed its relations after the start of clashes between Palestinians and Israeli troops five weeks ago in which at least 170 people, nearly all Palestinians, have been killed. Tunisia and Morocco shut down their interest sections in Israel after an Arab summit in Cairo, Egypt, last month. Egypt and Jordan, which do not border the Persian Gulf, remain the only Arab countries to have full diplomatic relations with Israel. Iran is a vehement opponent of Muslim countries improving ties with Israel. Tehran does not recognize the existence of the Jewish state. Khatami was critical of Arab leaders following the Cairo summit, accusing them of doing too little for the Palestinians. ``I am very unhappy with my brothers who recently gathered at the Arab League summit,'' Khatami said. ``I would like to voice my grievance as a member of the massive Islamic nation of several billion people, as the president of the Islamic Republic of Iran and as the chairman of the Organization of the Islamic Conference. I would like to say to you that you did not meet the expectations of the Islamic nation.'' The OIC presidency will be handed over to Qatar at the summit.

Iraq resumed domestic flights to the towns of Basra and Mosul on Sunday in defiance of no-fly zones enforced by U.S. and British warplanes since shortly after the 1991 Gulf War, the official Iraqi News Agency reported. Two Russian-made military cargo planes flew from Baghdad at 1 p.m. with a total of 154 passengers on board, the agency said. An Antonov with 42 passengers flew to Mosul and an Ilyusin with 114 passengers flew to Basra. Nearly a decade ago, Iraq moved its 15 Boeing airliners to Jordan, Iran and Tunisia to escape bombing during the Gulf War. They remain abroad. Thousands of people gathered to welcome the planes as they arrived in Basra and Mosul, according to the agency.

Iraq sent domestic passenger flights carrying 154 people into skies patrolled by U.S. and British warplanes on Sunday, the first challenge of its kind to the no-fly zones that Iraq considers infringements on its sovereignty. Two planes left Baghdad at 1 p.m. bound for Basra in the southern no-fly zone and Mosul in the northern zone, the official Iraqi News Agency reported. They returned safely to Baghdad about four hours later, the agency said. Iraq, which says the flights mark the resumption of regular passenger service to the cities, used Russian-made military cargo planes for the flights _ an Antonov with 42 passengers to Mosul and an Ilyushin with 114 passengers to Basra. The resumption of the flights, which Iraq announced on Oct. 30, came nearly a decade after Iraq's fleet of 15 Boeing airliners was moved to Jordan, Iran and Tunisia to escape bombing during the 1991 Gulf War. They remain abroad. Passengers aboard the inaugural flights included officials and journalists who returned with the planes to Baghdad. Thousands of people had gathered to welcome the planes on arrival in Basra and Mosul, according to INA. Transport Minister Ahmed Murtada Ahmed Khalil said flights will take off daily to the two cities. The United States says Iraqi military planes have violated the zones often with quick in-and-out forays since December 1998, when Iraq began challenging the patrols. The new challenges _ though in military aircraft _ marked the first civilian flights into the zone. The U.S.-British patrols bar fixed-wing Iraqi aircraft or helicopters from entering the zones, but there was no word on Sunday on whether Iraq had given Britain and the United States advance notice of the domestic flights. In Egypt, Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf said after meeting Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak that ``these flights will continue ... since the aim of these flights is to destroy the American-British criminal act of imposing the no-fly zones.'' The United States and Britain maintain the no-fly zones are needed to protect Kurdish and Shiite Muslim minorities from Iraqi forces. Iraq says the zones, which are not mandated by the United Nations, violate its sovereignty and international law. Iraq has been firing missiles and anti-aircraft artillery at the U.S. and British warplanes. The resumption of domestic flights follows the arrival in Baghdad of dozens of international flights from non-governmental organizations and foreign countries seeking an end to U.N. sanctions imposed to punish Iraq for invading Kuwait in 1990.

On the eve of an election with little more than a dozen of the 34 Senate races still competitive, Democrats face a Herculean task to have any hope of bringing six years of Republican control to an end. GOP senators hold a 54-46 margin in the outgoing Congress and go into the election with 35 holdovers returning to the 31 Democrats with two years or four years left in their terms. But Republicans also have a virtual lock on 12 of the 19 seats they are defending; Democrats are safe in only 10 of their 15 seats at stake. ``Democrats will have to thread the needle electorally to regain the Senate,'' said Marshall Wittmann, senior fellow for the Hudson Institute, a conservative public policy group. From Florida to Washington state, 11 races appear extremely competitive, an unusually high number that means Democrats can take over, but only if things break their way. With so many tight races and a lack of overriding national issues in the Senate campaigns, each party's phone calls, mailings and door-to-door canvassing will be crucial. As she has on the eve of the past seven elections, Mary Crouse plans to spend Monday evening telephoning fellow Minnesotans and asking them to vote Republican. ``It's a formula we've used,'' said Crouse, 67, a retired stationery store sales manager from the St. Paul, Minn., suburb of Forest Lake. ``And it's worked.'' Multiply Crouse by tens of thousands of volunteers, add many millions of dollars and sprinkle in drives by dozens of special interest groups, and that is what both parties are doing nationally. Also trying to mobilize voters are outside groups such as the Christian Coalition, the National Rifle Association, the AFL-CIO and the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. ``Turnout is everything for Democrats,'' said Jim Jordan, spokesman for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. Without ``first-class turnout operations, we don't win.'' Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., predicts his party will retain control. ``Obviously, both sides understand how important turnout is,'' he said. ``We've paid a lot of attention to that.'' Of the 11 races that seem closest, seven are for seats now held by Republicans, giving Democrats more targets of opportunity. Democrats will have to gain five seats to take control. A victory by Democratic presidential nominee Al Gore means that Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., would leave the Senate to become vice president and be replaced by a Republican appointed by the state's GOP governor, John Rowland. The highest profile Senate race is in New York, where first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton is pitted against GOP Rep. Rick Lazio. Capitalizing on the strong feelings Clinton engenders with the public, Lazio managed to outraise her $33 million to $27 million through mid-October and make the race the second most expensive in Senate history and a close contest. The most expensive Senate race ever is across the Hudson River in New Jersey, where Democrat Jon Corzine, former chief executive officer of Goldman Sachs investment bank, is expected to spend more than $60 million of his own money. Moderate GOP Rep. Bob Franks has about one-tenth that amount at his disposal but has made the race close by making Corzine's spending an issue. The previous individual record was set in 1994 by losing GOP candidate Michael Huffington, who spent $30 million. Democrat Diane Feinstein spent $14.4 million in winning that Senate race, and their $44.4 million total was the record until this year. In Missouri, GOP Sen. John Ashcroft is facing the widow of his original opponent, Democratic Gov. Mel Carnahan, who was killed in a plane crash on Oct. 16. His death occurred too late for his name to be removed from the ballot, but his wife, Jean, has said she would serve if her husband outpolls Ashcroft and the new Democratic governor appoints her. The only Democratic incumbent in trouble is Virginia Sen. Charles Robb, the former Marine combat veteran and son-in-law of President Lyndon Johnson. Former Gov. George Allen, son of the former Washington Redskins football coach of the same name, is given a good chance of unseating Robb. Besides Ashcroft, five other GOP senators face strong challenges. Senate Finance Committee Chairman William V. Roth, 79, a 30-year Senate veteran from Delaware, has fed concerns about his age by falling twice recently, once before television cameras. His challenger is the state's popular Democratic Gov. Thomas Carper, 53. Republican Sen. Conrad Burns was battling to hold his Montana seat against Democrat Brian Schweitzer, a wealthy rancher who tried to focus the election on high prescription drug prices. Sen. Spencer Abraham, R-Mich., is in a neck-and-neck race with Democratic Rep. Debbie Stabenow, a statehouse veteran. Also in trouble are Sens. Rod Grams, R-Minn., and Slade Gorton, R-Wash., both facing multimillionaire Democratic challengers. In other close races, Democrat Bill Nelson seemed to have a shrinking lead over GOP Rep. Bill McCollum for a Florida seat that was held by a Republican. Former Democratic Gov. Ben Nelson had a slight edge over GOP Attorney General Don Stenberg for Nebraska's open Democratic seat. In the House, where all 435 seats at stake, Republicans are trying to protect if not augment their current 222-209 majority. There are two independents and two vacancies. Only three or four dozen House seats are clearly in play, so control will hinge on just a few contests. Five of the battles are in California, including the nation's most expensive race, a fight between GOP Rep. Jim Rogan and Democratic challenger Adam Schiff. Kentucky and Florida each had two or three crucial races, with others in states including New York, New Jersey, Arkansas, Georgia, Connecticut and Washington state.

Russian and Norwegian divers searched the fourth compartment of the wrecked submarine Kursk, Sunday. But they found too much damage to proceed with the task of recovering bodies. A spokesman for Russia's Northern Fleet says the divers were only able to venture about one meter into the compartment because of poor visibility.

In the final dramatic days of a marathon campaign, Al Gore cast his duel with George W. Bush as a choice between ``two very different pathways,'' with the Supreme Court and economic progress in the balance. Bidding to regain the White House for the Republicans, Bush brandished tax cuts and Social Security reform while accusing Gore of practicing the ``politics of scaring people.'' The candidates rallied across a handful of battleground states Sunday and intensified their appeals to core supporters and undecided voters. Florida and the Midwest were in the political epicenter. Pre-election surveys suggested the battle could be the closest in generations, and indeed the Senate and the House were up for grabs too, with Republicans seeking to retain control. National polls gave a narrow edge to Bush in the presidential race to Bush, but Gore's support in large battleground states made for an unpredictable race to 270 electoral votes and victory. ``I'm asking you not only for your vote but for you enthusiasm,'' Gore said during one of two stops at black churches in Pennsylvania. ``I want you to go the extra mile.'' Bush's exhortations _ ``The voters are there, let's turn them out!'' _ took on special significance in Florida, where his brother Jeb runs a state that Bush had expected to put away weeks ago. In a nod to Cuban-Americans, Bush sprinkled a Miami speech with Spanish phrases, including one that translated to, ``We're going to take Washington, D.C.!'' and another that represented his middle initial and his winning hopes for Tuesday: ``W!'' Salsa music and a burst of daylight fireworks punctuated Bush's oratory. Bush, celebrating his 23rd wedding anniversary on the campaign trail, said, ``We need to get rid of the partisan bickering that has plagued Washington D.C. We need to get rid of the politics of anger and ... we need a fresh start, folks, after a season of cynicism.'' At the day's second rally, on a football field at Florida International University, Bush accused Clinton and Gore of being ``talkers, not doers'' and defended anew his Social Security and Medicare proposals. ``We need a president to bring Republicans and Democrats together to make sure the Social Security system works, not only for seniors but for younger workers as well,'' Bush said. The Bush plan would allow workers to invest some of their Social Security funds in the stock market, seen by Democrats as too risky. Gore started the day in hotly contested Pennsylvania, where he said that a woman's right to abortion was on the line. `The Supreme Court is at stake because the next president, the one you pick Tuesday, will pick a majority on the court that will interpret our Constitution for the next 30 to 40 years,'' he said, noting that Bush has praised conservative justices Clarence Thomas and Antonin Scalia. Gore mocked Bush's promise to be a get-along president, aiming his words at the large population of seniors citizens in both Pennsylvania and Florida. ``The question is, will he get along with HMOs? You'll get along with them fine if you kill the patients' bill of rights. The drug companies? You'll get along with them if you kill the prescription drug benefits for seniors,'' Gore said, concluding, ``There's a choice on Tuesday between two different pathways to the future.'' With 26 states and 225 electoral votes solidly in his column or leaning his way, Florida would put Bush at 250 votes and within reach of victory depending on results from one of the big Midwestern states or a combination of victories in such tossup states as Arkansas, New Mexico, Iowa, Delaware, New Hampshire, Maine and Oregon. Even Gore's home state of Tennessee was a target for Bush. Gore has 15 states plus the District of Columbia solidly in his column or leaning his way, for 241 electoral votes. However, that includes 62 votes from swing states where Bush has made a big push _ Pennsylvania, Michigan, Minnesota and Wisconsin, let alone California and Illinois. To win, Gore seeks to add Florida and one or two of the swing states. It was possible Bush might win the nationwide popular vote and Gore to prevail in the electoral college. That kind of split has happened just three times in the nation's history, most recently in 1888. The candidates' travel schedules told the tale. Bush, trying to expand the battlefield, dispatched running mate Dick Cheney to California while the nominee himself plans to close the campaign in Tennessee, Wisconsin, Iowa and Arkansas _ all Democratic strongholds during the Clinton-Gore elections. The vice president planned a sleepless sojourn through Iowa, Missouri, Michigan and back again to Florida _ 30-straight hours before returning home to Tennessee. Bush, too, was watching returns from his home state. Democrats conceded that Bush had more room for error. ``Just about everything has to go right for us,'' said Democratic strategist Dane Strother. One wildcard is Green Party candidate Ralph Nader, who threatens to cut into the Gore vote in such key states as California, Michigan, Minnesota, Oregon and Wisconsin. Nader urged supporters in Washington to ``vote their conscience,'' and Gore campaign chairman William Daley said on CBS's ``Face the Nation'' that Nader ``may make the difference in some states.'' A businessman took out a full-page ad in Sunday's New York Times, reassuring Nader supporters that ``a vote for Nader is not a vote for Bush'' in the Empire State, where Gore is expected to win easily. More is at stake Tuesday than the White House. Democrats sought to upset Republican control of the House and Senate, while most of the 11 governor's races on the ballot remained close until the end. Across the country: _ Jean Carnahan stepped up the campaign to elect her husband to the Senate despite his October death in a plane crash. The widow was asked to accept a Senate appointment if Gov. Mel Carnahan defeats Sen. John Ashcroft and she said on ABC that his legacy ``is too important to let die.'' _ House Speaker Dennis Hastert was in Connecticut trying to help Mark Nielsen defeat Rep. James Maloney, D-Conn. Connecticut Republicans also hope to defeat Democrat Sam Gejdenson in their battle to retain the House. ``This is an important race and an important election,'' Hastert said. ``We can win this.'' _About 200 legislative races tip the balance of power in some 20 states. ``It's old-time politics, shaking hands, eyeball to eyeball,'' said Mike Gaston, a GOP chairman in Clark County, Wash., where Republicans hope to overcome a 49-49 split in the House and win three seats to take the Senate. _Former President George Bush declared himself ``a nervous father'' in Iowa, but predicted victory for his son. President Clinton campaigned in Arkansas and said of the Gore-Bush race, ``It's close.'' Gore, who has tried to distance himself from the president, made a rare reference to the man Bush calls ``The Shadow.'' ``I want to thank you and all of Philadelphia for giving Bill Clinton and me a chance to bring change to the economy of this country,'' Gore said from the pulpit of a black church in Philadelphia. In Florida, the race is tighter than expected because Gore raised doubts about Bush's plans to privatize portions of Social Security and linked Bush to drug companies in the debate over prescription drug coverage. ``Al Gore has been relatively successful early on scaring seniors,'' said Gov. Jeb Bush who made the rounds of Sunday talk shows. ``Scare. Scare. Scare.'' His brother followed script at a West Palm Beach, Fla., rally. ``Somebody who tries to scare people into the voting booth must not be very confident about his own positions. You know what happens Nov. 7, we're going to reject the politics of scaring folks,'' the Texas governor said before flying to Miami, Tampa and Orlando in a busy bid to save the state. Like Bush in Florida, Gore was forced Sunday to defend once-friendly turf, appearing in Wisconsin _ a state that last backed a GOP presidential candidate in 1984.

When the Russian and United States navies ran into trouble at sea, both superpowers turned to the descendants of the Vikings _ Norwegians _ for help. The bomb-damaged American warship, USS Cole, is being brought home from Yemen aboard a giant Norwegian-owned specialized transport ship, the Blue Marlin. And when the Russia nuclear submarine Kursk sank in the arctic waters of the Barents Sea in August, the once-powerful Northern Fleet also looked to Norway for help. Twice. This Scandinavian nation of 4.5 million people has the world's third-largest merchant fleet. As the world's second-largest oil exporter, it also has leading-edge vessels and equipment needed to service the oil fields off its often storm-swept coast. ``We have always worked at sea,'' said Bente Baerheim of Stolt Offshore ASA, a Norwegian company that sent a ship and divers to confirm that the 118-member crew of the Kursk had died in the Aug. 12 disaster. Nowadays, however, it can be hard to spot much Norwegian about a Norwegian-owned ship, since the oil and shipping industries have become global. The vessel may be designed in one country, built in another, fly the flag of a third country, be manned by a foreign crew and never sail in Norway's waters. They are still Norwegian, insisted Ole Kristian Baervahr of the Norwegian Shipowners Association. ``Shipping is a global industry,'' he said. ``When looking at ships, the main thing you should consider is ownership, who controls them.'' Even before the Vikings set off on daring voyages in their longboats a millennium ago, Norwegians were already accomplished seafarers. They had no choice. Norway, which is nearly as long as continental Europe, has almost 13,600 miles of ragged coastline, with fjords that cut deep in the mountainous mainland. The nation turned to the water for transport. ``Norway has always been a seafaring nation,'' said Einar Braathen of the Norwegian Federation of Manufacturing Industries. ``Norwegians had to have that competence for anyone to be able to live here.'' But today, aboard the Norwegian ship Blue Marlin, it is another seafaring people _ the Latvians _ who run the show. Frederik Steenbuch, manager of Oslo-based Offshore Heavy Transport that owns the 56,000-ton Blue Marlin, laughed at the idea that Norwegians were transporting the USS Cole. The warship was badly damaged in an Oct. 12 bomb attack that killed 17 sailors and wounded 39. ``This has nothing to do with Norway,'' he said. ``It is purely international. The Blue Marlin was built in Taiwan, flies a Panama flag and has a crew from Latvia. ... The key machinery on board was built in Korea under a Danish license.'' Others say companies like Steenbuch's wouldn't exist without the nation's strong focus on the sea and thriving offshore oil industry. ``There is broad base of maritime and offshore competence in Norway,'' Baervahr said. The Norwegian vessels that went to the aid of the Russian navy after the Kursk disaster were developed for the offshore oil industry. A team of British and Norwegian deep-sea divers, who usually work for the oil industry, sailed to the Kursk wreck site aboard the DSV Seaway Eagle, an advanced Norwegian diving vessel. In about 30 hours, the oil industry divers were able to do what the Russian navy hadn't been able to do in a week: reach the Kursk under about 330 feet of water and confirm that the crew was dead. ``Most of the technology that made the Kursk operation possible was probably developed working for (the Norwegian oil companies) Statoil and Norsk Hydro off Norway,'' Baerheim said by telephone from the company's headquarters in the west coast city of Stavanger. But, Baerheim said, the Seaway Eagle was built in the Netherlands, flies a Liberian flag and has an international crew. Now another Norwegian offshore oil vessel, the Regalia, is working above the wreck of the Kursk, off northwestern Russia's Kola Peninsula, to recover the dead. Deep-sea divers from Norway and Russia, supported by the rig, have cut holes in the Kursk's hull and recovered a dozen bodies. The Regalia is owned by the Norwegian company ProSafe ASA, is under contract to the American concern Halliburton, flies a Bahamas' flag, was built in Sweden in 1985 and has a mainly Swedish and British crew. Baerheim said being global is also a Norwegian tradition. The Vikings, after all, sailed to North America and as far south as Baghdad. ``The Vikings were also very international. They had the world as their marketplace,'' she said.

Four men arrested over the past two days are being questioned about the fatal bombing of the USS Cole last month, sources close to the investigation said Monday. The newest suspects were tracked down through phone records showing that the suspected bombers had been in contact with them, the sources said on condition of anonymity. All four live in the southern port city of Aden, where the two suspected suicide bombers blew up a small boat filled with explosives alongside the Cole on Oct. 12 as it prepared to refuel. Seventeen Americans were killed. Investigations have also revealed that officials in Lahej, a stronghold of the militant Islamic Jihad, provided the suspected bombers with government cars for use within Aden and between Aden and Lahej, 22 miles to the north. The sources said the suspected bombers knew the officials from their time together fighting the Soviets in Afghanistan in the 1980s. The officials are believed to be affiliated with the Islamic Jihad, a group formed by veterans of the Afghan war, and had met several times with the suspected bombers since March, when preparations for the bombing are believed to have started. According to the sources, the two men took their boat for a test ride in the harbor where the Cole was to dock, one month before the bombing. One of the fishermen who helped them take the boat down into the water is believed to have been an accomplice, the sources said. The United States is pressing Yemeni authorities leading the probe to allow U.S. agents a greater role in the investigation. A Yemeni official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Monday that authorities have turned down an American request to relay their questions to the detainees. He said that expanding the American role in the investigation is being discussed, but that his country's stand remains that the Americans cannot interrogate any Yemeni citizens. There has been no claim of responsibility considered credible in the strike on the Cole. American officials have said Osama bin Laden _ America's No. 1 terror suspect who has pledged to drive the U.S. military out of the Middle East _ is a focus of the bombing investigation. The Saudi millionaire, who is living in Afghanistan, is accused of masterminding the 1998 bombings on U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.

Divers labored Monday to clear the jumble of debris in a compartment of the wrecked nuclear submarine Kursk, hoping to find bodies of some of the 118 men who died when it exploded and sank, the Russian navy said. The compartment, which includes the submarine's living and service areas, is strewn with instruments and machinery, some of which had to be cut apart and removed, said Capt. Vadim Serga, a spokesman for Russia's Northern Fleet. Since cutting a hole into the compartment Sunday, the divers have not been able to move more than about six feet into the compartment, where officials have said the bodies of 12 seamen may be found, Serga said. Relatively calm weather in the Barents Sea was aiding the work, Serga said, but weather forecasts indicated heavy winds may hit the region Monday night. Although the divers are working 350 feet below the surface, severe weather could force suspension of the recovery effort because high waves toss the ships to which the divers are connected by tethers. So far, only 12 bodies have been recovered from the submarine, which sank Aug. 12. Because of the intensity of the explosion that shattered the vessel, officials say many of the bodies may have been blown apart. All the bodies recovered so far were found in the submarine's stern. At least 23 sailors survived the initial explosion in the rear of the vessel, as indicated by a letter found on the body of Lt. Dmitry Kolesnikov. Twelve bodies have been recovered and identified. On Monday, officials released the names of two more bodies that had been identified as Seaman Roman Kubikov and Petty Officer Vyacheslav Mainagashev, the Interfax news agency reported. The cause of the Kursk's sinking remains unknown. Russian officials favor a theory that a collision with a foreign submarine set off the powerful blasts. But others have said the most likely reason was a torpedo exploding in its tube because of a technical malfunction. A state commission of inquiry into the sinking of the Kursk is to convene in Moscow on Wednesday, according to Russian news reports. Also Monday, a chapel built as a gift to submariners was opened in Vidyayevo, which had been the Kursk's home, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported. The log chapel was built by carpenters from Kostroma, a city noted for its wooden architecture.

America was electing a president Tuesday in what bid to be the closest election in 40 years, choosing between Republican George W. Bush's promise to be a ``uniter not a divider'' and Democrat Al Gore's claim that he alone has the experience to ``fight for you and win.'' Voters also were choosing a new Congress. Exhausted by the effort, the candidates _ Bush, the governor of Texas and son of a president, and Gore, the vice president, for eight years a presidential understudy _ surrendered their fate to the voters and made ready to join millions of their fellow citizens at the polls. Bush was casting his ballot in Austin, Texas, and making calls to West Coast radio stations to urge voters to turn out. He also was calling voters in Michigan, Oregon, Florida, Iowa and Wisconsin After some pre-dawn campaigning in Florida, Gore was voting in Carthage, Tenn. The earliest results came in moments after midnight Tuesday from two New Hampshire towns. In Dixville Notch, the result was Bush, 21, Gore 5, Ralph Nader 1. In nearby Hart's Location, it was Bush 17, and Gore 13, with one vote for a write-in candidate. Before that Election Day ritual, the candidates barnstormed the country one last time. Bush hit four states _ Tennessee, Wisconsin, Iowa and Arkansas _ that voted for President Clinton and Gore in 1992 and 1996, but which polls suggest could go Republican. ``My spirits are high. I feel great,'' he told an audience after returning to Austin just after midnight. For his part, Gore engaged in marathon campaigning through crucial Iowa, Missouri, Michigan and Florida, where he said the star-studded crowd of tens thousands that greeted him in Miami's fashionable South Beach left him with ``no doubt whatsoever'' of a win there. ``Florida is the place where the future is being born,'' Gore said. Behind them was the most expensive election in history _ $3 billion on presidential and congressional races, about $30 for every vote cast _ but one that failed to stir much excitement. In addition to replacing Clinton, the people were electing all 435 members of the House, 34 senators and 11 governors, filling their state legislatures and settling 204 ballot issues in 42 states, ranging from legalizing marijuana in Alaska to fluoridating the water in San Antonio, Texas. Despite millions of automated phone calls and waves of television advertising, analysts predicted that fewer than half the adult population would vote, about the same as the 96 million who cast ballots in 1996. With peace and prosperity both at hand and not big issues, the fight was chiefly over how to divide the spoils: in the big tax cuts the Texas governor proposes or in shoring up Medicare, Social Security and education, as the vice president favors. Bush portrayed himself as more trustworthy and capable of ending bickering in Washington _ ``a uniter.'' Gore said his two decades in government give him the experience to prevail in taking on the special interests. ``You need someone who will fight for you and win and has the experience to do so,'' he argued. Bush led in most national polls and enjoyed a potentially decisive enthusiasm edge among likely voters. But late polls showed a tightening of the race. Gore held fragile leads in many of the swing states that may decide the election. An unusually large number of states were in the tossup camp _ Florida, New Hampshire, West Virginia, Ohio, Michigan, Missouri, Pennsylvania, Oregon, Washington, Wisconsin and New Mexico among them. Even Gore's Tennessee and Clinton's Arkansas were close calls. Bush was safe in Texas, where he has been a popular two-term governor, and had a lock on most of the South. Gore's task was complicated by ``Clinton fatigue'' _ a weariness of the sex scandal that led to an impeachment ordeal _ and by the base-eroding threat posed by the insurgent Nader, who argued both major parties are captives of the same corporate money. If Nader can win 5 percent of the national vote, his Green Party would be assured of federal financing in 2004. The election's apparent closeness raised the remote possibility of a Bush victory in the popular vote but a Gore edge where it counts in the Electoral College, where each state has as many votes as it has seats in Congress. Such outcomes have occurred three times in U.S. history, most recently in 1888. The battle for Congress after six years of Republican dominance was just as murky. Democrats hoped to regain control of the Senate, where the GOP holds sway, 54-46, and the House, where Republicans hold a 222-209 majority, with two independents and two vacancies. And a Senate tie was possible, with the new vice president _ either Republican Dick Cheney or Democrat Joseph Lieberman _ casting the vote to decide which party controls. Or Sen. Lieberman, still on Connecticut's ballot for re-election, could win the vice presidency, forcing him to resign from the Senate and possibly throw the chamber to the GOP. For the first time in history, a president's wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, sought election to the Senate. She faced Republican Rep. Rick Lazio in New York, nominated when prostate cancer caused New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani to abandon plans to run. Clinton, his wife and daughter Chelsea voted at an elementary school in Chappaqua, N.Y. Clinton said he felt sad about not being on the ballot, but had come to accept it. ``I've had my time, and it was a good time,'' he said. ``I've loved it.'' In five states, women were major-party candidates for governor, including Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, battling her Republican opponent while also battling breast cancer. In Missouri, Senate Democratic candidate Mel Carnahan remained on the ballot despite the Oct. 16 plane crash that killed him. Carnahan's successor as governor, Roger Wilson, promised to appoint Carnahan's widow to the seat if Republican incumbent John Ashcroft loses.

Republicans scored an important victory Tuesday when former Gov. George Allen defeated Sen. Charles Robb in Virginia, a turnover that gave Democrats only a distant chance of regaining control of the Senate. The Democrats did win two Republican Senate seats, defeating Sen. William Roth of Delaware, the five-termer who heads the Finance Committee, and taking the seat vacated in Florida by retiring Sen. Connie Mack. But the Robb defeat left them with a steep hill to climb to recapture control of the Senate they lost in 1994. The earliest returns for the House of Representatives showed no party switches. Republicans held onto two sharply contested Kentucky seats, those of Reps. Anne Northup in Louisville and Ernie Fletcher in the Lexington-Frankfort area. Democrats needed a net gain of seven seats to retake the House, which they also lost in 1994. They were assured of one pickup _ in California, where no Republican was running to succeed Rep. Matthew Martinez, who only became a Republican last spring after losing the Democratic primary. With several close races anticipated on the West Coast, a final House tally was not expected before Wednesday at the earliest. In Washington state, which has three hotly fought House races and a competitive Senate battle, officials estimated that as many as half the votes would be cast by absentee ballot. They said they were not sure how long it would take to count them. In Senate races, the already bizarre Missouri contest, where the late Democratic governor, Mel Carnahan, was running neck and neck with Sen. John Ashcroft, a Republican, took another unusual turn when a federal judge ordered the polls held open an extra three hours in St. Louis, where Democrats had sought extended hours because of huge lines and a heavy turnout. But after less than an hour of extra voting, Republicans, who complained that it was unfair to give Democratic St. Louis extra voting time, won an appeal to close the polls. The bitterly fought Virginia race, where back-to-back television ads competed to call each candidate a liar, gave Allen a solid victory, although well short of a landslide. Allen rolled up votes in rural areas. A heavy black vote helped Robb, but fell short of the overwhelming majorities of more than 90 percent he recorded four years ago when he defeated former Lt. Col. Oliver North. In the Delaware race, Roth, 79, promised to use his seniority to deliver political plums to the tiny state, while Gov. Thomas Carper, 53, a vowed to bring new energy to the job, in a veiled reference to his rival's age. Late in the campaign, Roth fell twice, once on camera, which only served to underscore public concerns about his health. (NEW MATERIAL FOLLOWS) Going into Tuesday's balloting, the margin of control of the House was the closest since 1954, when there were 219 Republicans, 215 Democrats and one independent on Election Day. In that election, Democrats won 232 seats and Republicans 203. This year, there were 222 Republicans, 209 Democrats, two independents _ one of whom votes with each party _ and two vacancies, one caused by the death of a Republican and the other by the death of a Democrat. But after the Republican landslide of 1994 swept out vulnerable Democrats and weaker Republicans were thinned out in the 1996 and 1998 elections, no more than three dozen seats were left that constituted real battlegrounds, and the parties and outside interest groups poured millions of dollars into them. Republicans had far more retirements, which led to open seats that are usually easier to win than seats that are defended by incumbents. Headed into Election Day, both parties had predicted they would capture control. The Senate, though, was not that close. Headed into Election Day, Republicans held 54 seats while Democrats had 46. In both houses, Democratic gains were expected, but a change of control seemed unlikely, though not impossible. One test for Democrats was their ability to hold seats that had been opened by the retirements of Democratic incumbents who would have been easily re-elected. They did so in New York with Hillary Rodham Clinton, the first first lady to run for office, who won election to the seat held by Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the Democrat who had served four terms. She defeated Rep. Rick A. Lazio, R-N.Y. The Democrats' task was almost as easy in New Jersey, where Jon Corzine, an investment banker, poured $60 million of his own money into winning the seat vacated by fellow Democrat Frank Lautenberg. Corzine defeated Rep. Bob Franks, R-N.J. In one closely watched House race, the Democrats picked up a seat vacated by a retiring Republican, Tom Coburn of Oklahoma. Coburn kept his pledge to retire after three terms, but his handpicked successor, Andy Ewing, was defeated by Brad Carson, a Democratic lawyer.

Republicans scored an important victory Tuesday when former Gov. George Allen defeated Sen. Charles Robb in Virginia, a turnover that led Democratic leaders to say they would not regain control of the U.S. Senate. Even with final results yet to come in several states that Democrats hoped to win, Sen. Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the minority leader, said that at best ``we could be at 50-50 in the Senate.'' But that would still leave the Senate in Republican hands. Sen. Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut, who lost as Vice President Al Gore's running mate, will now return to the Senate, eliminating the risk that Gov. John G. Rowland could have appointed a Republican to succeed him. With Dick Cheney elected vice president, he would preside and cast a tie-breaking vote for the Republicans. The Democrats did win three Republican Senate seats, defeating Sens. William Roth of Delaware, the five-term incumbent who heads the Finance Committee, and Rod Gramms, a Minnesota freshman, as well as taking the seat vacated in Florida by the retiring Sen. Connie Mack. Incomplete returns for the House of Representatives suggested that a Democratic bid to capture control there was also faltering. Republicans held on to two sharply contested Kentucky seats, those of Reps. Anne Northup in Louisville and Ernie Fletcher in the Lexington-Frankfort area. Those results presaged a series of victories by incumbents of both parties who had seemed in danger this fall. But Samuel Gejdenson, a 20-year Democratic veteran from Connecticut, apparently lost to state Rep. Robert Simmons. Democrats took an open Republican seat in Oklahoma, but Republicans won Democratic seats in Virginia and Pennsylvania, and the parties swapped seats on Long Island. In all those races, incumbents were not running again. The Democrats needed a net gain of seven seats to retake the House, which they also lost in 1994. They had been assured of one pickup _ in California, where no Republican was running to succeed Rep. Matthew Martinez, who only became a Republican last spring after losing the Democratic primary. With several close races anticipated on the West Coast, a final House tally was not expected before Wednesday at the earliest.

The bitterly fought Virginia race, where back-to-back television ads competed to call each candidate a liar, gave Allen a clear but unspectacular victory. Allen rolled up votes in rural areas. A heavy black vote helped Robb, but fell short of the overwhelming majorities of more than 90 percent he recorded four years ago when he defeated former Lt. Col. Oliver North. ``Once the Virginia race was called for George Allen, Democrats' odds of retaking the Senate became very, very long,'' said Jennifer E. Duffy, who tracks Senate races for the Cook Political Report, a nonpartisan newsletter in Washington. Still, Duffy said, a burden rested on four embattled Republicans in Missouri, Montana, Michigan and Washington. ``If you're John Ashcroft, Conrad Burns, Spence Abraham or Slade Gorton, the fate of the Senate sits on your shoulders,'' she said, referring to those states' senators. In the Delaware race, Roth, 79, promised to use his seniority to deliver political plums to the tiny state, while Gov. Thomas Carper, 53, vowed to bring new energy to the job, in a veiled reference to his rival's age. Late in the campaign, Roth fell twice, once in from of television cameras, and the falls only served to underscore public concerns about his health. ``For many people, this was a tough choice,'' Carper said in a telephone interview Tuesday night, ``but in the end they looked to the future.'' Carper sidestepped questions about whether he felt that concerns over Roth's health turned the election in the governor's favor. Going into Tuesday's balloting, the margin of control of the House was the closest since 1954, when there were 219 Republicans, 215 Democrats and one independent on Election Day. In that election, Democrats won 232 seats and Republicans 203.

The Democrats' task was almost as easy in New Jersey, where Jon Corzine, an investment banker, poured $60 million of his own money into winning the seat vacated by fellow Democrat Frank Lautenberg. Corzine defeated Rep. Bob Franks, R-N.J. Democrats seemed sure to end the night with gains in the Senate. In the Florida contest for Mack's Senate seat, Bill Nelson, the Democratic state insurance commissioner, defeated Rep. Bill McCollum, a 20-year House veteran and a manager in the impeachment effort against President Clinton. In Minnesota, Grams was beaten by Mark Dayton, an heir to the Dayton-Hudson department store fortune and a former state auditor. In one closely watched House race, the Democrats picked up a seat vacated by a retiring Republican, Tom Coburn of Oklahoma. Coburn kept his pledge to retire after three terms, but his handpicked successor, Andy Ewing, was defeated by Brad Carson, a Democratic lawyer. But state Sen. Ed Schrock, a retired admiral, won one of the most heavily militarized districts in the country, in Virginia Beach and Norfolk. He defeated Jody Wagner, a Norfolk lawyer, to take the seat that opened when Owen Picket, a Democrat, retired. In Pennsylvania, state Sen.Melissa Hart won a seat that has been Democratic for decades, a seat that opened up when Rep. Ron Klink made an unsuccessful effort to unseat Sen. Rick Santorum, a freshman Republican. In New York, Felix Grucci, a Republican, won the Long Island seat that opened when Michael P. Forbes, a Republican turned Democrat, was defeated in the primary. In the neighboring district, Steve Israel, the Democrat, defeated Joan Johnson for the seat vacated when Lazio ran against Clinton.

Republicans appeared on the way to extending their six-year reign in the Senate, even as first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton swept to a history-making victory by capturing a Senate seat in New York for Democrats. Mrs. Clinton swamped Republican Rep. Rick Lazio to become the first presidential spouse elected to Congress. Despite her victory, Democrats were left having to sweep all five Senate races that were still undecided late Tuesday evening. That left the GOP one seat away from retaining its hold on the chamber. Republicans held a 54-46 edge before the voting. ``There's a positive feeling about incumbents because the economy is good, we're at peace, we've balanced the budget, and we've had welfare reform,'' Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., himself easily re-elected, said during his victory party in Jackson, Miss. Even so, Senate Democratic Leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota predicted additional victories and said he was not giving up hope that he would be majority leader in the next Congress. ``We've got a lot to look forward to tonight,'' he said on CNN. Holding the majority would give the Republicans their first eight-year stretch of Senate supremacy since the 1932 elections ended 14 years of unbroken GOP control. Veteran Democratic Sen. Charles Robb of Virginia, Republican Sen. Rod Grams of Minnesota and William Roth, the long-time Delaware Republican, all were toppled from office. Roth, 79, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, lost his bid for a sixth term to Delaware Democratic Gov. Thomas Carper. Roth's age had become a factor in the race after he stumbled twice publicly. Of the 40 percent of voters who said Roth's age would hinder his ability to serve effectively, nearly nine in 10 said they voted for Carper, according to exit interviews by Voter News Service, a consortium of the AP and television networks. Striking back for the GOP, Republican George Allen, the former governor of Virginia, ousted Robb after two terms in the Senate. Robb, son-in-law of President Lyndon Johnson, was the last Democrat holding statewide office in the GOP-trending Old Dominion. ``It would be a major disappointment to me if the results of this race mean the difference'' in Republicans keeping control of Senate, Robb said in his concession speech. But in a remark that every victorious candidate would assuredly second, Allen told cheering supporters, ``Tonight we begin moving forward and it sure is sweet.'' In Minnesota, department store heir Mark Dayton used millions of his own money to defeat the conservative Grams, who served a low-profile single term and was beset by a divorce and other personal problems. Perhaps the evening's most poignant drama involved the race for for Republican John Ashcroft's Missouri seat. Ashcroft's opponent, Democratic Gov. Mel Carnahan, died in an Oct. 16 plane crash. His widow, Jean, said she would accept the new governor's offer to appoint her if her husband outpolled Ashcroft. Mrs. Clinton's bitter battle against Lazio, the upstart four-term congressman from Long Island, became an expensive contest that drew donors from across the country in what was partly an emotional proxy referendum on Bill Clinton and his presidency. Underlining how Mrs. Clinton's candidacy polarized voters, about half of Lazio's supporters said in interviews that they were mainly voting against Mrs. Clinton. But despite Lazio's efforts to cast Mrs. Clinton as an out-of-state carpetbagger, half of voters interviewed said the issue didn't bother them, and strong majorities of women, blacks and Hispanics supported her. ``Thank you for opening up your minds and your heart, for seeing the possibility of what we can do together,'' she told cheering supporters at a Manhattan hotel, her beaming husband and daughter, Chelsea, beside her. Democrats got a boost in New Jersey where Democrat Jon Corzine, after spending more than $60 million of his own fortune, held onto a seat vacated by Democratic Sen. Frank Lautenberg. Corzine, a former chief executive officer of Goldman Sachs, outspent four-term GOP Rep. Bob Franks by 10-1, making it the costliest two-candidate Senate race in history. Franks' effort to make Corzine's record-setting expenditures an issue fell short. In Florida, Democrat Bill Nelson, the state's insurance commissioner, grabbed the seat of Republican Sen. Connie Mack, who is retiring. Nelson defeated GOP Rep. Bill McCollum, who was a manager during President Clinton's impeachment trial and spent his campaign trying to moderate his conservative image. But former Republican Rep. John Ensign nabbed the Nevada Senate seat vacated by the retirement of Democratic Sen. Richard Bryan. Ensign, who narrowly lost a 1998 Senate bid, easily defeated Democrat Ed Bernstein. Sen. Zell Miller, D-Ga., appointed to replace the late GOP Sen. Paul Coverdell, easily won the remaining four years in Coverdell's term. By capturing more than half the vote in a field of seven candidates, the popular former governor averted a Nov. 28 runoff. Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., Democratic presidential candidate Al Gore's running mate, won easy re-election to his Senate seat. But a Gore victory would make Lieberman vice president, opening the door for GOP Connecticut Gov. John Rowland to name a Republican to replace him in the Senate. A victory by George W. Bush, the GOP presidential contender, would make Dick Cheney vice president, in line to break any tie votes in the Senate. Either way, Democrats needed 51 Senate seats to be assured of a majority. Based on history, neither party expected the presidential candidates to have much impact on the Senate struggle. The last time a winning presidential candidate's party also gained Senate seats was Ronald Reagan's 1980 GOP landslide. Three committee chairmen breezed to re-election: Agriculture Committee Chairman Richard Lugar of Indiana, Health and Education Committee Chairman James Jeffords of Vermont and Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch of Utah. A Democratic icon, Sen. Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts, first elected in 1962, won his seventh full term. And Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., the second-longest serving senator ever, won his eighth term. Also winning re-election were Republican Sens. Mike DeWine of Ohio, Bill Frist of Tennessee, Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas, Olympia Snowe of Maine and Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania. Other incumbents re-elected included Democrats Kent Conrad in North Dakota, Jeff Bingaman in New Mexico, Diane Feinstein in California, Daniel Akaka in Hawaii and Herb Kohl in Wisconsin. Republicans Craig Thomas in Wyoming and Jon Kyl in Arizona also won. Republican Lincoln Chafee of Rhode Island was elected to his own six-year term a year after being appointed to the seat after the death of his father, John, who had been a revered institution in the state's political scene. Though there were no national issues common to the Senate contests, most shared an underlying factor: money. From January 1999 through Oct. 18 of this year, 108 candidates in the 34 Senate races reported raising $327 million, 52 percent more than the same period two years earlier. That excluded the roughly $80 million raised by the National Republican Senatorial Committee, a figure nearly matched by its counterpart, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. Also untabulated were as many millions of dollars in unregulated soft money that corporations, unions and other interest groups use to buttress each side. The money spent by Corzine, former chief executive officer of Goldman Sachs investment bank, was expected to more than double the previous record for a Senate candidate. California Republican Rep. Michael Huffington used $30 million in a losing effort against Democrat Dianne Feinstein in 1994. Huffington and Feinstein combined for $44.4 million, the previous record for total spending in a Senate race. The Clinton-Lazio race also surpassed that contest, with Lazio reporting spending $33 million through Oct. 18 to Clinton's $26 million.

Reluctant to claim victory for her late husband but confident that Mel Carnahan ``would be really proud,'' Jean Carnahan thanked voters who elected him U.S. senator three weeks after his death. ``We remain heirs of a legacy, bearers of a dream,'' she told supporters gathered in St. Louis early Wednesday. Democratic Gov. Roger Wilson had offered to appoint her to the Senate if her late husband defeated Republican Sen. John Ashcroft on Tuesday. Mrs. Carnahan said she would accept the offer to keep her husband's legacy alive. Mel Carnahan led Ashcroft by more than 41,000 votes out of 2.3 million cast. ``It has been such an incredible outpouring, people making special efforts to take friends to polls, people who haven't been involved in politics,'' Mrs. Carnahan said in a telephone interview with The Associated Press early Wednesday. ``They believed in the cause and they wanted to be a part of it,'' she said. ``I think he would really be proud of what people have done for him.'' The two-term governor died in a plane crash Oct. 16, along with the couple's eldest son, Roger, and campaign adviser Chris Sifford. Ashcroft, 58, took an eight-day hiatus from campaigning, which he said hurt him when polls gave the deceased governor an edge. Ashcroft and GOP backers also lashed out at the media, saying journalists were suppressing his message. Mrs. Carnahan, 66, conducted a low-key but effective campaign, consisting mainly of one news conference, one TV commercial and a single interview from the seclusion of the family home. Moderate voters _ who account for nearly half the electorate _ made the difference for her husband, favoring the Democrat by a 3-to-2 margin, according to Voter News Service exit polling. Of Carnahan voters, better than nine in 10 would have chosen his widow, too, the poll found. No one had ever posthumously won election to the Senate, though voters on at least three occasions sent deceased candidates to the House. Some Republicans have floated the idea of a legal challenge, arguing the late governor was not an inhabitant of Missouri, as the U.S. Constitution requires. Carnahan supporters must first weather allegations of voter fraud in St. Louis. Heavy turnout prompted a state judge, at Democrats' request, to keep polls open until 10 p.m. After nearly an hour, an appeals court swiftly threw out the order and closed the polls. Mrs. Carnahan said she is committed to promoting her late husband's ideas and values. ``It appears that many believed in that legacy and want that message to be carried on,'' she said.

After a night of suspense and drama, the presidential vote is cast but the verdict is unknown. The outcome of the race between Republican George W. Bush and Democrat Al Gore hung on an incomplete vote count Wednesday in Florida, where only a few thousand votes separated the two candidates out of 95 million cast across America. The outcome _ or lack of one _ left the nation wondering who would succeed Bill Clinton on Jan. 20 and raised the prospect the question would be unanswered for days. Gore himself thought he had lost, when the broadcast networks projected Bush the winner in Florida _ and thus the nation. The vice president telephoned his congratulations to the Texas governor. Then he called again and took his concession back. ``There's never been a night like this one,'' Gore campaign chairman William Daley said at Gore headquarters in Nashville, Tenn. ``This race is simply too close to call.'' Standing in the rain, the Nashville crowd chanted, ``Recount!'' The Associated Press count showed Bush leading by less than 1,700 votes in Florida, and both the Bush and Gore campaigns were sending teams of lawyers to the state Wednesday to keep an eye on the recount. Daley said former Secretary of State Warren Christopher would oversee the recount for the Democrats. A formal canvass of the Florida ballots could take 10 days. The election stacked up as the closest race since John F. Kennedy defeated Richard M. Nixon in 1960 by 118,574 votes, a contest whose outcome was also uncertain until the day after the voting. Bush and Gore were both in reach of the 270 electoral votes needed to win the presidency. As dawn broke in the East, Bush has won 29 states for 246 electoral votes. Gore has won 18 states plus the District of Columbia for 255. Green Party insurgent Ralph Nader failed to get enough votes to qualify for federal funding in 2004, but he took enough _ presumably from Gore _ to emerge as the potential spoiler to the vice president. The congressional race was narrow as well. Before the election, Congress was Republican but closely divided and it emerged Republican and even more closely divided following Tuesday's voting. Republicans picked up six Democratic House seats in scattered states, enough to renew their hold for two more years. But their majority shrank when they gave back eight other seats elsewhere, including four in California. ``We figured it was going to be close,'' said House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill. _ and it was. With winners declared in 33 of the 34 races at stake, Republicans will have at least a 50-48 margin in the Senate. Too close to call was the race in Washington state, where former Rep. Maria Cantwell was challenging incumbent Republican Sen. Slade Gorton. Voters ousted Sen. William V. Roth of Delaware, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee and father of the tax-saving Roth IRA, as well as four Republicans and Democrat Chuck Robb of Virginia Missourians rejected Republican Sen. John Ashcroft, electing instead their dead governor, Mel Carnahan, killed three weeks ago in a plane crash. His successor has pledged to appoint widow Jean Carnahan, who told supporters, ``I pledge to you, rather, let's pledge to each other, never let the fire go out.'' In New York, Hillary Rodham Clinton became the first president's wife to win a Senate seat. When word of his wife's victory came in, President Clinton was on the telephone in their hotel suite, talking to a personality named Billy T on Las Vegas radio station KCEP, trying to nudge Westerners to the polls. Clinton told Billy T he was the first president in history to have a wife in the Senate ``and I like it.'' Across the nation, with 98 percent of the votes counted, Bush and running mate Dick Cheney had 48 percent to 48 percent for Gore and his running mate, Joseph Lieberman, who was bidding to become the first Jewish vice president. The Gore-Lieberman ticket held a slim lead in the popular vote. Regardless of the outcome of the presidential race, Lieberman was guaranteed a job next year. He easily won re-election to the Senate from his home state of Connecticut. If the Democrats win the White House, he would be replaced by a Republican appointed by the state's GOP governor. Bush, whose father, President George H.W. Bush, was defeated by Clinton in 1992, had the satisfaction of carrying both Clinton's and Gore's home states of Arkansas and Tennessee. Bush, in Austin, Texas, ate dinner and said he was worried more about what the suspense was doing to his parents than to himself. He did not address his supporters, who waited deep into the night in a cold rain. And Gore, aides said, went to bed. Voter turnout was higher than expected, a notch above 1996, when fewer than half of the adult population cast ballots. On Tuesday, between 52 percent and 53 percent voted, estimated one turnout expert, Curtis Gans, director of the Committee for the Study of the American Electorate. ``It's kind of neat to be that important,'' said Barbara Garwood, 50, in Orlando, Fla., who voted for Bush. She made that comment at a time it appeared that Florida had delivered victory to Bush. Some voters saw the election as a referendum on Clinton's stewardship. ``I don't want another eight years of the kind of administration we've had,'' said David Fair, a Knoxville, Tenn., priest who voted for Bush. ``I feel our country has become less moral.'' But Gordy Janisse, 48, a custodian in St. Clair Shores, Mich., pointed to the economy to explain his vote for Gore. ``Why try to fix something that's not broke?'' he asked. ``It's common sense.'' Exit polls showed that voters who cared most about taxes and world affairs supported Bush, while those most concerned about Medicare, prescription drugs, Social Security, the economy and education favored Gore. Bush was the solid favorite among men and white voters and the wealthy, while Gore won among women, blacks, Hispanics and those earning below $30,000 a year, according to the exit interviews, which were conducted by Voter News Service, a consortium of The Associated Press and the television networks. Nader won just 3 percent of the national vote. That was good enough to potentially tip several states to Bush _ Florida among them. Thus, Nader fell short of the 5 percent of the national vote to qualify his party for federal campaign funds in the 2004 elections. But Nader was far from disappointed: ``We're in it for the long run.'' ``You can't spoil a system spoiled to the core,'' he said to a standing-room crowd in the ballroom of the National Press Club. About half of Nader voters said in exit polls they would have voted for Gore in a two-way race; about 30 percent said they simply would not have voted without Nader in the race. ``I voted for Nader because I didn't like any of the other candidates,'' said Melissa Larson, 22, a student at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee. ``I'd rather have Gore (than Bush), but I couldn't bring myself to vote for him.'' The Reform Party's candidate, Pat Buchanan, reduced to an asterisk, barely registered. Clinton's scandals may have hurt Gore. About two thirds of voters said in exit polls that Clinton would be more remembered for scandal than for his leadership. Those who considered the scandals as important tended to vote for Bush, the polls said.

Defense Secretary William Cohen said Wednesday it is too early to conclude that suspected terrorist mastermind Osama bin Laden was behind the bombing of the USS Cole in Yemen. Speaking with reporters in his Pentagon office, Cohen was asked whether evidence collected so far by U.S. and Yemeni investigators points to bin Laden, the exiled Saudi millionaire who is wanted by the FBI in connection with the 1998 bombings of U.S. embassies in Africa. ``We can't say that at this point,'' Cohen responded. ``That's a conclusion that hopefully the FBI will be able to reach (soon), in terms of who is responsible and who we can hold accountable. Osama bin Laden is one that we will continue to look at, but it is by no means definitive at this point as to who was responsible for this.'' Bin Laden has called for a holy war on the United States and vowed to drive the U.S. military out of the Middle East. The Cole, a guided-missile destroyer, was refueling in Aden harbor on Oct. 12 when a small boat loaded with explosives maneuvered to the ship's side and detonated the bomb, blowing a 40-by-40-foot hole in the hull and killing 17 sailors. Cohen said U.S. investigators in Yemen are ``still getting good cooperation'' from Yemeni authorities, but he knew of no breakthroughs. The Cole, meanwhile, continued its journey aboard the heavy-lift ship Blue Marlin en route to the United States. Navy officials said Tuesday no final decision had been made on whether the Cole would return to its home port at Norfolk, Va., or to a shipyard in Maine or Mississippi. The Navy intends to repair the $1 billion ship and return it to service.

From BBC news in London, I'm Gregor Craggy for the world. The American people have now spoken but it is going to take a little while to determine exactly what they said. That was President Clinton's conclusion a short while ago as he arrived back in Washington. As the race to succeed him remains deadlocked, the president found a silver lining in today's extraordinary situation. No American will ever be able to seriously say again my vote doesn't count. A crucial recount is now underway in Florida. The state holds the key to the fate of both Al Gore and George W. Bush, Prisilla Huff reports. In Florida the recount is proceeding slowly. George W Bush is confident he is the next occupant of the White House. Al Gore cautions the process is ongoing. Let me make my own resolve clear. No matter what the outcome, America will make the transition to a new administration with dignity, with full respect for the freely expressed will of the people and with pride in the democracy we're privileged to share. As the tally is checked and double-checked, rumors are flying of all kinds of vote are fraud. Election officials are being very cautious. So fat Gore has gained some votes in the recount and the margin of difference is slim. For the World I'm Prissila Huff in Washington. The election has also produced a tight outcome in Congress. Democrats have captured a few seats but not enough to take the narrow majority the Republicans still hold in both houses. Susan Marmian has more. In California, Republicans lost 4 seats in the House Of Representatives for a total of 8 seats given over to Democrats nationwide. But Democrats lost 6 seats of their own, which means Republicans have squeaked by with a majority for another 2 years. Republicans will also continue to rule the roost in the Senate although now by a narrower margin. One of the seats Republicans lost in the Senate went to a Missouri Democrat. Residents there voted to send their beloved Democratic Governor Mell Cornaheim to Congress. Cornahaim diet in the plane crash while campaigning last month making him the first dead man ever to win a spot in the US Senate. His widow is expected to take his place. For the World I'm Susan Marmian. In New York Hillary Clinton won her Senate race. She is the first, First Lady elected to public office but she says there is no chance, she will run for the White House in 4 years. No I am going to serve my 6 years as the Junior Senator from New York. I felt very gratified that so many people were working so hard on behalf of a positive campaign about the issues. The Republican still hold at least 50 seats in the Senate, Democrats have gained two seats in the house, but still trail the Republicans by nine. Voters in 42 states also decided on a range of policy proposals and in Alabama they lifted a 99-year-old unenforceable ban on interracial marriage. Voters also approved background checks for all gun buyers at gun shows in Colorado and Oregon and in Arizona they ended bilingual education. BBC news, for the World I'm Gregor Craggy.

Praising Missouri for being a ``compassionate state,'' Republican John Ashcroft conceded the Senate election to the late Gov. Mel Carnahan, paving the way for his widow to assume the seat. ``I hope the outcome of this election is a comfort to Mrs. Carnahan,'' Ashcroft said in an emotional speech Wednesday while surrounded by family and two dozen supporters at his suburban St. Louis headquarters. Mel Carnahan _ whose named remained on the ballot after being killed in a plane crash on the way to a campaign rally three weeks ago _ outpolled Ashcroft by more than 48,000 votes out of 2.36 million cast Tuesday. Never before in U.S. history has anyone posthumously won election to the Senate, though voters on at least three occasions chose deceased candidates for the House. ``Missouri is a compassionate state and, I think, in a very special way, they have demonstrated their compassion,'' Ashcroft said. Before the election, Roger Wilson, the new Democratic governor, said that if Carnahan won, he would appoint his 66-year-old widow, Jean Carnahan, to the Senate. She would take on the position after Ashcroft's term ends Jan. 3, and would serve until the next general election, in 2002. Ashcroft, a former two-term governor, state attorney general and auditor, said he plans to go back to his farm near Springfield after his term ends. ``I look forward to spending time with my wife, Janet,'' Ashcroft, 58, said, breaking off to fight back tears as his wife laid her head on his shoulder. He said he does not want to think about whether he will seek the same seat in 2002 or any other office. Ashcroft also rejected the possibility of a challenge to the election, saying he will not take part in any legal action and will discourage others from doing so. Some Republicans had argued that at the time of the election, Carnahan was not _ as the U.S. Constitution requires _ a Missouri inhabitant, because he was dead. Also, the Missouri GOP has urged an investigation into possible voter fraud in St. Louis on Tuesday. ``I don't think my election hinged on voter fraud in the city,'' Ashcroft said. ``I lost this race because I didn't get as many votes as my opponent did.'' A Voter News Service exit poll of 1,431 Missouri voters found Ashcroft had strong support from the third of voters who called themselves conservatives. But self-proclaimed moderates, who made up nearly half of the state electorate, favored his opponent. About three-fifths of moderates said they voted for Carnahan. Results were subject to a sampling error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points for all voters, higher for subgroups. Political observers applauded Ashcroft's speech. ``He's a smart man and a smart politician, and he did everything perfectly in terms of doing what he should have done, being gracious, being sensitive and not closing a single door,'' said Ken Warren, a Saint Louis University political science professor. After the plane crash, Ashcroft took an eight-day hiatus from campaigning, which he said hurt him in the polls. If Ashcroft is known as the first Senate candidate ever to lose to a dead person, Warren said, it won't be a negative association. ``Ashcroft had an impossible job,'' he said. ``The whole situation developed very late in the campaign, where the bounce Carnahan got from his tragic death did not dissipate in time for Ashcroft to rebound himself from having to stand on the sidelines while Carnahan was praised.'' Mrs. Carnahan conducted a low-key but effective effort consisting mainly of one news conference, one TV commercial and a single interview from the family home. Early Wednesday, she spoke to hundreds of St. Louis-area supporters from her home in Rolla. ``We remain heirs of a legacy, bearers of a dream,'' Mrs. Carnahan said. ``On this night, I pledge to you _ rather, let us pledge to each other _ we will never let the fire go out. God bless you always.''

Bowing to Iranian and Saudi pressure, Qatar announced Thursday it will shut down an Israeli trade mission in Doha. Qatar, the only Arab state in the Persian Gulf region to maintain commercial ties with Israel, did not say if it would officially sever relations with the Jewish state. But relations between the two countries were based solely on this mission. Tunisia and Morocco, two North African Arab states, closed their interest sections in Israel after last month's Arab summit in Cairo. Egypt and Jordan are the only Arab countries that maintain full diplomatic relations with Israel. ``The state of Qatar has decided to close the Israeli trade representative office in Doha to consolidate Islamic solidarity,'' an official Qatari source was quoted as saying by the official Qatar News Agency. The move followed intense pressure from several countries, including Libya, invited to the Islamic summit in Doha. Iran and Saudi Arabia had threatened to boycott the gathering if Qatar, the only Gulf state with ties to Israel, did not shut down the low-level office. The QNA news agency said the decision came ``in appreciation of what the leaders of Islamic countries in the Organization of the Islamic Conference had expressed toward the critical circumstances that the Middle East is going through.'' Following the Qatari announcement, Iran announced that President Mohammad Khatami will attend the summit in an official statement from the president's office in Tehran. The two-story Doha villa that Israel used as a trade mission had become the focus of discussions at a ministerial meeting that was originally expected to discuss the plight of Palestinians. Earlier, Qatari Foreign Minister Sheik Hamad bin Jassem bin Jabor Al Thani said Qatar was considering closing the trade mission. ``But we haven't taken the decision yet because there are ongoing Palestinian-American contacts and because during the latest Arab summit Arab leaders said that peace was the strategic choice,'' Sheik Hamad added. ``But if matters deteriorate further we will sever ties.'' Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat meets President Clinton in Washington on Thursday amid efforts to end weeks of Israeli-Palestinian violence that has left nearly 180 people, mostly Palestinians, dead. In an opening statement at the conference's ministerial meeting, Kharrazi called on Islamic nations to ``unify and solidify our positions in support of Palestine'' and find ways to ``counter the ongoing brutal and inhumane aggression and alleviate the suffering of the Palestinian people.'' Following the eruption of the clashes Sept. 28, Oman, a Gulf state, severed its relations with Israel, leaving Qatar as the only Arab state in the Gulf region to have commercial ties with Israel.

It was a day of mourning in the West African nation of Ivory Coast today. A massive funeral ceremony was held at a sports stadium in the commercial capital of Abidjan for those killed last month in violence following contest of presidential elections. The unrest led to the overthrow of the country's military leader General Robert Guei who had tried to hold on to power despite his defeat at the polls. New President Lauran Gbagbo has since pledged to work for national unity and today he told thousands of mourners at the stadium ceremony that he will strive for peace and reconciliation. The BBC's Mark Doyal filed this report from Abidjan. They died, the funeral obituary said, in the name of democracy. The shock of what happened here in late October is still sinking in. Some 200 dead, may be more, to oust a military regime. This woman representing the mothers of the victims said Ivory Coast had changed from being a peaceful country to one that she no longer recognized. In the football stadium, it soon became apparent that the funeral ceremony was also to be a victory rally for President Gbagbo, his name chanted from the stands. A veteran opponent of military and single party civilian rule, Lauran Gbagbo made a call for national reconciliation, a nod in the direction of healing old wounds. But he was also victorious. After twenty years of opposing undemocratic governance, Lauran Gbagbo was in his element. The single party days and the days of military coups were over he said, 'Finit'. While few people would question Lauran Gbagbo's right to a victory celebration, after all he is widely believed to have won the elections the military tried to steal, some of his fellow Heads of State, including the powerful Presidents of South Africa and Nigeria are worried. They have called for fresh elections, partly because some of the other potential candidates were excluded by the military from the October polls. But most Ivorians, and not surprisingly Lauran Gbagbo himself, disagree. The new Ivory Coast leader got a roar of approval when he told the crowd he would tell foreign leaders who called for new elections to leave Ivory Coast to sort out its own problems. The mood of the crowd at the funeral ceremony was a mixture of sadness for the dead and anger for those seem to be responsible. These pro- Gbagbo students are chanting a war song to taunt the soldiers they overthrew. Emotions are running high here and few people think that Ivory Coast's political turmoil is over yet. For The World, I am Mark Doyal in Abidjan.

Bowing to intense pressure from several Islamic states, Qatar has closed Israel's Trade Mission in Doha before an Islamic summit in the Qatari capital. Saudi Arabia, Iran, and several other countries have threatened to boycott the Organization of the Islamic Conference summit, unless Qatar severed its low-level ties with Israel. VOA Middle East correspondent Scott Bob reports Qatar is the fourth Arab nation to break relations because of the violence between Palestinians and Israelis over the past six weeks. Qatar announced it was closing the small Israeli Trade office in Doha in the face of a growing threat of a boycott of the Islamic summit by several powerful members. Saudi Arabia announced Wednesday it would not attend the summit, due to begin Sunday. And Iran hinted its President, outgoing Chairman of the Islamic Conference Mohammad Khatami might not attend. Libya has also said it will not attend. Qatar earlier had refused to close the Israeli Trade Mission. Three other Arab nations, Oman, Morocco, and Tunisia closed their Israeli Trade offices after a summit of Arab leaders two weeks ago called for the freezing of all normalization with Israel in retaliation for the violence. Arab leaders accused Israel of reacting too harshly to Palestinian street protests. The Israeli government says the protest had been encouraged by Palestinian leaders. The Iranian government which opposes the Oslo Peace Accord criticized the Arab Summit for not completely breaking all relations with Israel. Egypt, Jordan, and Mauritania are the only Arab nations with full diplomatic relations with Israel. But these have been severely strained by the recent violence. The Qatari foreign minister announced the measure to foreign minister of the Islamic Conference as they began preliminary meetings Thursday, in Doha. The Qatari minister criticized the repression of Palestinians and said there will no peace without implementation of the UN resolutions on the Middle East conflict.

Cuba blamed election uncertainty in Florida on foes of Fidel Castro, charging that Cuban exiles there are desperately trying to regain the political power they lost with Elian Gonzalez's return to the communist island. ``A dark cloud today darkens the political scene in the United States,'' the Communist Party daily Granma declared Thursday in a front-page editorial. ``Once again this nation pays the price for its leaders' criminal and genocidal policies toward our nation,'' it said. For Cuba, the recount of presidential votes across Florida, complaints of voter confusion over ballots in Palm Beach County and a smattering of reports of alleged irregularities in other areas was proof of efforts by Cuban exiles to hold on to power. ``This time the mafia is going all out,'' said the editorial, using a term commonly employed by Cuba's leadership to describe anti-Castro exiles in Florida. The exiles are ``thirsty for revenge, desirous of recuperating lost ground'' after losing the battle earlier this year to block 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez's return to Cuba, the editorial said. The boy, who survived a boat wreck during a journey to the United States, returned with his father in late June after a seven-month tug-of-war between the Cuban government and exiles in Florida. ``Once the decisive day of the presidential elections arrived, they thought themselves capable of deciding who will be the president of the United States,'' Granma said of the exiles. The editorial accused the exile community of ``electoral fraud as was carried out by their predecessors in Cuba before the revolution.'' Meanwhile, Cuban Foreign Minister Felipe Roque Perez, in New York on Thursday for a U.N. visit, drew a link between the election's outcome and frequent U.S. advice to other nations. ``I believe that those in the United States who have always tried to become judges of elections that take place elsewhere must be receiving a lesson of modesty and humbleness,'' Perez Roque said at a news conference. He added that Cuba would gladly send monitors for a new election if asked by U.S. officials. On Wednesday night, Cuban state television showed Castro mocking the American electoral process with a visit to the beach. The bearded Castro walked in the sand at the beach in his typical olive green uniform and chatted with bathing suit-clad tourists from the United States and Europe. One American man was shown giving a thumbs-down both to Vice President Al Gore and Texas Gov. George W. Bush. Regardless of who becomes American president, Castro has promised to continue resisting U.S. pressure and has said he does not believe the four-decade trade embargo against Cuba can last forever. U.S. lawmakers have made numerous proposals to ease the trade sanctions over the past year, only to have them narrowly defeated or watered down amid concerns about the Cuban-American vote in the months leading up to the presidential election. Cuban officials complain the only legislative proposal that became law _ the agricultural appropriation bill, which permits the export of food and medicine to Cuba _ makes the import of U.S. food too difficult to be practical.

The first American farmers to visit Cuba since passage of a new U.S. law allowing them to sell food to the island said Friday they failed to convince communist officials to buy their products. ``We need the Cuban government to take a more positive position on the opportunity provided by the legislation,'' Jack Laurie, president of the Michigan Farm Bureau, told a news conference. ``We would hope to persuade them to look more positively at what we have accomplished, than what we have not,'' said Laurie, who was flanked by other officials of the farm bureau and the Michigan Dry Bean Commission. The Cuban government insists it will not buy a cent of American food under the legislation that would allow U.S. agricultural sales to the island for the first time in about 40 years. Because of pressures from Fidel Castro's foes in Congress, the law bars the U.S. government and American banks from financing the purchases _ restrictions the Cuban government says make such sales almost impossible. Those restrictions would require Cuba to pay for food either in cash or through financing via third countries. Cuban officials also were angered by the law's tightening of restrictions on travel by Americans to the island. Laurie and other members of the Michigan agricultural mission said they would willingly finance sales of agricultural products to Cuba via third countries. ``I think commercially it's possible _ clumsy, but possible,'' he said. ``Unfortunately trade between two countries cannot be void of political concerns.'' Although the Cuban government expressed interest in buying dry beans and other products from Michigan farmers, it refuses to back down on its insistence that it will not do so under the law, Laurie said. Cuban officials' apparent concern, Laurie said, is ``if they do it, that will say that this mechanism will work... And we concur that it will not work long-term. ``Still, we would like to test the mechanism,'' he added. Members of the trade mission said they would attempt to secure additional legislation to remove the new law's financing restrictions and thus open the door for food sales. Michigan farmers say Cuban officials told them that if and when the legislation changes they have an open invitation to export their dry beans to Cuba. Bob Green, executive director of the Michigan Bean Commission, estimated his state could sell as much as $10 million worth of dry beans to Cuba annually. Cuba currently consumes about 180,000 tons of dry beans annually, Cuban officials say. Of that, about 100,000 tons is imported, most of it from Mexico, Argentina and Canada. About half of the imports are black beans, the legume most common in Cuban diets. Another 40 percent are red and pinto beans, and 10 percent are navy beans. Michigan delegation members said Cuban officials told them the island imports more than $900 million annually in food, including 1.2 million tons of cereals, 420,000 tons of rice and another 200 million tons of grain. ``The buyer is willing, but the conditions of the market make it difficult,'' Laurie said. ``We feel that it is important that the Cubans know .... that our industry and the majority of the American people intend to change these laws at the start of the next Congress.''

Almost a year after efforts to launch new global trade talks collapsed in Seattle, U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky said Saturday that the World Trade Organization should agree on fresh negotiations by 2001. ``I would think well within the next year, yes,'' Barshefsky told The Associated Press in Singapore, just before she was to fly to Brunei, where Pacific Rim leaders, inlcuding President Clinton, will hold their annual summit this week. The disastrous WTO meeting in Seattle was a big blow for Barshefsky and the Clinton administration, with protesters battling police outside and trade ministers on the inside unable to agree on a formula for new trade liberalization talks. This week's Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum can do no more than urge new WTO talks, but Barshefsky expressed confidence the world's trade ministers can soon find enough common ground to make it happen. ``We, Europe and a number of the developing countries have been in the process of laying quite a bit of groundwork for it,'' Barshefsky said by telephone. ``And I think the question is not whether there will be a new round, but when. It's reasonable to presume that a new round will be inaugurated, certainly, within the next year.'' Barchevsky sounded more optimistic than others gathering here ahead of the APEC summit. Malaysia _ which believes the WTO still hasn't done enough to meet the concerns of developing countries _ has expressed skepticism that APEC will even call for WTO talks, given the deep divisions between rich and poor nations in the WTO. But Barshefsky said: ``Quite a bit of the resistance is moderating, and I think that without a new round we do risk the atomization of global trade, and that would be a disastrous result.'' At their summit, leaders from the 21 APEC nations are also expected to ask OPEC to boost oil output to bring down fuel bills in the consuming nations. Pacific Rim economies are projected to grow by 3.5 percent next year, but persistent high oil prices could slash those prospects by almost one-third, officials said Saturday. APEC economic ministers start their meetings Sunday, followed by the gathering of heads of state Wednesday and Thursday. APEC is a loose grouping of 21 economies with a goal of free trade between both sides of the Pacific Rim by 2020. The members are Canada, Chile, Mexico, Peru and the United States; China, Brunei, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, the Philippines, Russia, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam; and Australia, New Zealand and Papua New Guinea.

A train transporting skiers to a glacier resort in Austria caught on fire inside a mountain tunnel Saturday, trapping as many as 140 people, the mayor of a nearby town said. The train is reported to be around 600 yards inside the mountain. ``Some people have been rescued but we have no way of knowing if there is any more survivors,'' said Norbert Karlsboeck, mayor of Kaprun, a town some 50 miles south of Salzburg in the central Austrian Alps. A massive rescue operation was launched, with some 13 helicopters, teams of police, doctors and Red Cross workers all at the site, the mayor said. The fire broke out at about 9:30 a.m. local time. ``We do not know anything about the reason for the fire, only that it broke out on the train,'' Karlsboeck said. Police were calling on motorists to keep away from the area so as not to hinder rescue attempts.

A train transporting skiers to an Austrian alpine resort caught on fire Saturday, trapping as many as 140 people inside a mountain tunnel, the mayor of a nearby town said. Fifteen people, all with minor injuries, were rescued, the Austria Press Agency. Rescuers still have not been able to reach the burning compartment on the train, reportedly stopped 600 yards inside the mountain. ``Some people have been rescued but we have no way of knowing if there are any more survivors,'' said Norbert Karlsboeck, mayor of Kaprun, a town some 50 miles south of Salzburg in the central Austrian Alps. A massive rescue operation was launched after the fire broke out at 9:30 a.m., with some 13 helicopters and teams of police, doctors and Red Cross workers at the site, the mayor said. ``We don't have any contact with the (burning) compartment, that's the problem at this point,'' a spokesman from the Salzburg regional police told the Austria Press Agency. The train, on rails and pulled by cables, takes skiers up the mountain from Kaprun to the glacier resort of Kitzsteinhorn and passes through a long tunnel along the way. ``We do not know anything about the reason for the fire, only that it broke out on the train,'' Karlsboeck said. Police were calling on motorists to keep away from the area so as not to hinder rescue attempts.

A train transporting skiers to an Austrian alpine resort caught on fire Saturday, trapping more than 100 people, local officials said. The Red Cross said about 15 people managed to escape, but at least three people were dead. The train, pulled by cable underground for most of the more than 3,200 yards up the Kitzsteinhorn mountain to the ski slopes, was reported to be around 600 yards inside the mountain, in the heart of the Austrian Alps. Rescuers still have not been able to reach the burning compartment on the train. ``Some people have been rescued but we have no way of knowing if there are any more survivors,'' said Norbert Karlsboeck, mayor of Kaprun, a town at the base of the mountain some 50 miles south of Salzburg in the central Austrian Alps. Fifteen people, all with minor injuries, were rescued from the scene, the Austria Press Agency said, citing Salzburg Red Cross officials. But the officials also said, without elaboration, that there were at least three dead. A massive rescue operation was launched after the fire broke out at 9:30 a.m., with some 13 helicopters and teams of police, doctors and Red Cross workers at the site, the mayor said. ``We don't have any contact with the (burning) compartment, that's the problem at this point,'' a spokesman from the Salzburg regional police told the Austria Press Agency. ``We do not know anything about the reason for the fire, only that it broke out on the train,'' Karlsboeck said. The resort is a popular summer and early winter skiing resort, situated at some 3,200 yards high in the Alps. Police were calling on motorists to keep away from the area so as not to hinder rescue attempts.

Polar bears, their white coats tinged with yellow after a summer of fasting on the tundra, are gathering here on the western shores of the Hudson Bay, waiting for sea ice that once again will free them from land, allowing them to hunt seals. Almost imperceptibly, this timeless tableau on treeless salt marshes is changing: the ``Lords of the Arctic,'' North America's largest land carnivores, are 10 percent thinner and have 10 percent fewer cubs than they did 20 years ago. The culprit, scientists and residents here said, is climate change. Today, on average, ice melts off the Hudson Bay three weeks earlier than 25 years ago. That means three weeks less each year for the polar bears to hunt and gorge on seal pups. And so the bay's 1,200 polar bears, the world's southernmost polar bear population, are fast becoming worldwide symbols of climate change. In mid-November, when the first adolescent male bears gingerly test the new ice here, protesters in The Hague, Netherlands, are to dress in sad-faced polar bear costumes and stage ``die-ins'' at opening sessions of negotiations over the Kyoto Protocol, a three-year-old international treaty intended to cut greenhouse gases. ``The polar bear is coming to symbolize the disappearing north, the end of the kind of climate we all grew up with,'' said Peter Tabuns, executive director of Greenpeace Canada, which has 120,000 members. ``The habitat that polar bears depend on is being wiped out. That is pretty strong stuff, emotionally and intellectually.'' Ursus maritimus, or bear of the sea, is the kind of charismatic mammal favored for promoting environmental causes. Fascinated by these ``gentle giants,'' 10,000 tourists from around the world trek every fall to this northern village of 1,100 residents, reachable only by train or plane. On the main street, where one not-so-gentle giant killed a local man in 1984, affluent visitors flock to the Lazy Bear Lodge and Cafe, the Bear Country Inn and the Great White Bear Gift Shop. Bristling with cameras, tourists roll out daily in tundra buggies, heated, elevated, bear-proof viewing mobiles, or lift off in sleek helicopters, with polar bears painted on the noses. Every spring, bears prowl ice floes, smashing open snow lairs that seals create over breathing holes. Gorging on seal pups, a 1,200-pound adult male bear can pack as much as 150 pounds of seal meat into his stomach. ``It's the big bear pig-out,'' said Jane Waterman, a University of Central Florida biologist who has worked here with Ian Stirling, the lead polar bear researcher in Manitoba. ``When they come off the sea ice, they are big bags of lard with feet.'' But by all indicators, ice in the western Hudson Bay is breaking up earlier as temperatures rise. ``The trend for earlier breakup is really important for polar bears, because the spring is when polar bears store most of their energy,'' said Stirling, a research biologist for the Canadian Wildlife Service. ``If bears are only able to feed for two weeks less than 20 years ago, that means two weeks less energy, two weeks less fat than 20 years ago.'' Since 1950, temperatures here have risen by half a degree Fahrenheit every decade. For this century, scientists project that temperatures will rise by 4 degrees to 11 degrees. If trends stay unchanged, within 30 years this sub-Arctic region of treeless tundra could shift to New England-style temperate leafy forest, according to a climate change model prepared by Environment Canada, a federal agency. ``One of the forecasts is that we will eventually lose ice in the Hudson Bay,'' said Stirling, who has studied bears here for 30 years. ``If that happens, we may lose bears in the bay.'' Canada and Russia will be the two nations most affected by global warming in this century, predicted a report issued in September by the World Wide Fund for Nature, a private group. With a polar bear staring from the cover, the report predicted that in this province, about half the current habitats would be altered or lost, and that nearly half of animal and plant species would have to migrate northward at the rate of half a mile a year to survive. nn

Ashen-faced and weeping, friends and relatives of the missing waited Saturday for word of where their loved ones were: On a ski slope in the heart of the Austrian Alps south of Salzburg, or dead inside a cable car demolished by fire. As distraught relatives gathered miles from the scene of the disaster that killed about 170 people, plumes of smoke kept spewing for hours from the mouth of the tunnel where the car burned. ``Why us? Why so many?'' asked Deacon Peter Hofer at a memorial service at the local fire hall. About 100 residents came, including firefighters and rescue crews still in their oilskins. ``God is with us in our sadness, in our need and in our pain, and together we will find a way out of all our mourning,'' Hofer said. Three caskets lay in the hall, apparently bodies of people who were waiting in a passenger area outside the tunnel and died of smoke inhalation. Emergency crews spent the day trying to figure out who was dead and who was just unaccounted for. Firefighters wearing protective breathing gear busied themselves at the tunnel entrance _ and some who came out said the car was torched down to the chassis. Earlier Saturday, about 180 people, many of them children or teen-agers, were riding the cable car up Kitzsteinhorn mountain to enjoy late fall sunshine and balmy weather at the popular glacial peak and ski resort. But as the car was pulled through the long tunnel that burrows into the mountain, fire broke out, leaving it trapped. There was no escape for most of those inside as the fire raged on for hours: Many victims apparently managed to get out of the burning car but were killed by acrid smoke as they tried to flee by running upward on narrow stairs leading out of the tunnel, said Manfred Muller, the head of cable car technical operations. Only a handful of people managed to make their way out into the Alpine air. Afterward, road access to the tunnel was blocked by police, with even friends and relatives unable to get access to the site. Instead, downvalley, in the resort town of Kaprun, they gathered in a sports hall to wait for officials to compile lists of who was where. As night fell and a full moon rose over the picture-postcard Alpine village, many had no idea if their children, friends, brothers and sisters were dead or alive. One man from the neighboring town of Mittersill was waiting, hoping that his son Marcus, 16, would be among the survivors. ``My son went up there with one of his friends,'' said the man, who asked not to be identified. ``A friend works at the cable car. He gave him two free passes.'' Nearby, a woman and her daughter clasped each other, crying wordlessly. At one end of the hall, volunteers entered name after name into computers, recording people who were still alive and had been tracked down in nearby hotels. Among those not yet located were 23 Americans, including two children, from a ski club at the U.S. military's Leighton Barracks in Wuerzburg, Germany, said trip leader Debbie Bruce-Duncan. She said she and several others from the group hadn't gone up the mountain because they decided to shop Saturday instead of skiing. The U.S. military in Germany said two ski clubs from the Kaiserslautern military community also were believed to have been in the Kaprun area Saturday. A U.S. military spokesman had no immediate details. Salzburg Gov. Franz Schausberger suggested that those trapped inside when the fire broke out early in the morning didn't have a chance. Because of the draft at both ends of the tunnel, air currents fanned the flames, and the blaze ``spread at a raging speed _ like in a fireplace,'' Schausberger said. Among the lucky ones were a handful of German survivors who were among the 18 people hospitalized. Hospital officials said they managed to find their way through choking smoke to the outside ramp leading up to the tunnel entrance after a ``very strongly built man,'' smashed a window with a ski pole. They were rushed to a local hospital. A group of about 40 Slovenes also had luck on their side: They turned around on the way to the tunnel after their bus developed problems.

A volcano outside Mexico City grumbled for a third straight day Saturday, spewing ash, gas and water a mile above its crater as a moderate-level alert remained in effect. The government warned people to stay at least six miles away from the Popocatepetl volcano, which had erupted 76 times by Saturday afternoon and was expected to continue belching ash over the next few days, the National Center for the Prevention of Disasters said. The emissions do not posed a threat to population centers in the area, it said. Scientists began to observe a tremor in the volcano following an eruption Thursday that spewed ash up to 25 miles. The tremor indicated a buildup of energy that could lead to further eruptions, they said. Communities in the state of Puebla have reported light ash falls in recent days from the Popocatepetl (Poe-poe-kah-TEP-a-til) volcano. The 17,886-foot volcano is about 40 miles southeast of Mexico City. It has been spewing vapor, ash and rock intermittently since December 1994 after lying largely dormant since 1927. In an unrelated incident, the Colima volcano in western Mexico shot smoke hundreds of feet late Friday but later calmed down and posed no threat to area residents.

At least three plots against American targets in Yemen failed in the past year before last month's suicide bombing of the USS Cole, Yemeni sources close to the investigation said Saturday. More than one suspect in Yemeni custody being questioned in connection with the Oct. 12 Cole bombing has admitted to involvement in a campaign targeting Americans in Yemen, the sources said, insisting on anonymity. They did not provide a specific number but did say the suspects belong to the Islamic Jihad and other Islamic groups. The Islamic Jihad is linked to America's No. 1 terror suspect, Osama bin Laden. In the first week of November 1999, Yemeni authorities foiled plans to blow up a convoy of U.S. military personnel heading to Yemen's National Center for the Removal of Land Mines hours before the operation was to be carried out, the sources said. Yemeni security forces discovered the explosives _ planted about one mile away from the hotel where the Americans were staying _ and defused them, sources said. Suspects being questioned in the Cole explosion gave detailed information regarding the route the Americans took to and from the center, where U.S. military personnel give Yemenis technical training on removing land mines, the sources said. It is estimated that more that than 30 Americans _ all military _ were at the center when the explosives were set to go off. When that attempt fell apart, the sources said the suspects made plans to attack the Royal Hotel, near the port in Aden, where most of the American servicemen were staying. It wasn't immediately clear when that operation was to be carried out, and no details were available on why it failed. An attack similar to the one carried out on the Cole was aborted in January when the attackers realized their boat had been overloaded with explosives and was not seaworthy, the sources said. ABC News, citing intelligence sources, has reported that the target of that attack was the USS The Sullivans, a destroyer that refueled in Yemen on Jan. 3. In Washington, a U.S. intelligence official has confirmed that some of the same people thought to have been involved in the Cole attack botched a similar attack 10 months ago against a U.S. warship that had stopped to refuel in Aden harbor. Seventeen sailors were killed and 39 others were injured when the Cole was bombed Oct. 12.

About 170 people are dead after a fire broke out in a cable car in the Austrian Alps. Officials in the Salzburg region say many of the dead were children and teenagers. The fire spread rapidly through the car as it passed through a three-kilometer long tunnel. Reporter Marilyn Kuna has more on the tragedy. It's a train that goes up to a glacier which is renowned for snow boarding and it's one of the most modern trains and everybody is still asking themselves how this could have happened. Eight people escaped the car, which was believed carrying a capacity load of about 180. Most of the victims were skiers traveling to Kitzsteinhorn Mountain, one of Austria's most popular resorts near the city of Salzburg. The victims may include many visitors from Germany, Britain and the United States.

Evacuation workers struggling through Saturday night in a dark and cold Alpine tunnel began extracting the bodies of about 155 people, including eight Americans, who perished on Saturday when a cable car they were riding to a ski run was destroyed in an inferno of flames. Officials said the bodies of those killed in Austria's worst Alpine disaster were so badly burned that they could be positively identified only by DNA testing, which is expected to begin on Monday. The rumble of rescue helicopters could be heard throughout Sunday over this mountain village, population 3,500, as about 80 rescue workers entered the tunnel to begin carrying out the bodies on stretchers. These were then transported by helicopter to a tent at the foot of the cable-car rails, which stretch about two and a half miles to an Alpine glacier favored by skiers. On Saturday morning, the cable car, which can transport as many as 180 people, wormed its way through the tunnel that pierces the Kitzsteinhorn mountain. Skiers and snowboarders, many of them teen-agers and children, were traveling to the snow-dusted glacier for a morning of skiing in late fall sunshine. But as the cable car moved through the mountain, fire broke out, transforming the tunnel into a chimney of fierce smoke and flames. The Austrian government declared a state of mourning, and in Vienna, the capital, dignitaries including the Austrian president, Thomas Klestil, joined thousands of people at a mourning service in the city's cathedral. Public buildings, including the Vienna State Opera, were draped in black, and flags flew at half staff. The deaths ``leave us speechless, since nothing more now can be done,'' the chancellor, Wolfgang Schuessel, said at an ecumenical religious service near the foot of the cable-car tracks. ``Consolation can come only from our faith and our church.'' The accident has sent Austrians into a frenzy of soul-searching. The Alpine region lives increasingly on tourism revenue, and the question of how safe its winter sport facilities are has been cast into stark relief. Schuessel, at a news conference in a local gymnasium, said Austria spent millions of dollars annually to ensure ``an extremely high level of safety'' in its skiing centers. But he said experts would seek to find out what more should be done. The Kaprun cable car, he said, would not be put back into service until the cause of the accident had been determined and corrective steps taken. The accident is certain to fuel discussion of the safety of Alpine tunnels in general. In May 1999, a fire in the Tauern auto tunnel in Salzburg province killed 12 people. Earlier last year, a raging fire in the Mont Blanc tunnel that connects France and Italy left 39 people dead. Emergency crews could begin entering the Kitzsteinhorn tunnel only on Sunday afternoon, after the tunnel had cooled and toxic gases formed by the fire had dissipated. Electric lighting had to be assembled so workers could pick their way through the burned and twisted wreckage, which was strewn with bodies. An Austrian police officer overseeing the evacuation, Maj. Franz Lang, described the inside of the tunnel as ``relatively dark, cold, with some smoke in some areas.'' He said that the exact number of victims was still unknown, but that it could be as high as 175. Walther Thaler, a regional deputy to the Austrian Parliament in Vienna, said a rescue worker had told him the scene in the tunnel was ``so horrific he did not want to describe it, for the sake of the families.'' Officials said the victims included more than 90 Austrians or Germans, two Slovenians, one Croatian, 10 Japanese, and also eight Americans from the U.S. Army's Leighton Barracks, near Wuerzburg, Germany, who were members of a military ski club vacationing in Austria. Other members of the American group were apparently spared the disaster when they chose to go shopping on Saturday rather than ski, a member of the group said. Maj. Drew Stathis, one of the American group, was quoted by The Associated Press as saying that among the Americans believed missing was a family of four, including two children. But Franz Schausberger, governor of the province of Salzburg, which includes Kaprun, said the identification of the victims by nationality was based only on circumstantial information, like tourist lists and indications from friends or relatives, and thus had to be taken ``with corresponding caution.'' Positive identification of individuals would be possible, he said, only by DNA testing. Beginning on Monday, the bodies will be transported to forensic laboratories in Salzburg, about 60 miles northeast of here, and relatives of the presumed victims will be asked to supply material for genetic comparison. As a cloudless day gave way to a crisp cold night and full moon, many had no idea whether their relatives had been found or removed from the tunnel. ``The waiting, the waiting is awful,'' said the Rev. Peter Hofer, the local Catholic pastor, who celebrated a Mass of mourning for the victims on Sunday. In the Gothic chapel of St. Margaretha, perched above the tiny village of chalets straddling a mountain stream, townspeople came through the day to light candles and pray. Along the streets, residents placed candles in front of their homes _ to commemorate the victims, a hotel clerk said. Wolfgang Poiger, a dairy technician in his 30s who had come from the neighboring resort of Zell am See with his wife and two children, said he first realized something was wrong on Saturday when helicopters passed through the Alpine valleys with increasing frequency. His wife said they were awaiting news of the 8-year-old daughter of friends, who was believed to have been aboard the cable car. Like many of the villages in these stretches of the Austrian Alps, Kaprun subsisted from farming until after World War II. To spur the economy, the government erected a major hydroelectric plant nearby after the war. But it was not until the region discovered its full tourism potential, based on hiking in summer and skiing in winter, that the area gained in affluence. Among the old Alpine farmhouses, with their peaked roofs and gingerbread balconies, there are now cozy hotels created in similar style. Blessed with the presence of one of Austria's two or three glaciers, and affording almost year-round skiing, the region attracts skiers from across Europe and beyond. Thaler, the regional legislator, said Kaprun drew an estimated 100,000 skiers and other vacationers each year. The cable car, over 90 feet long, travels on rail tracks but is pulled up the tunnel by cable, much as San Francisco's cable cars are moved. It had gone about 600 yards into the two-and-a-half-mile tunnel when the fire broke out. Officials said the cause of the fire was not yet known. But Schausberger, the governor, said, ``We are assuming that the fire spread with lightning speed,'' making the use of fire extinguishers or other emergency measures aboard the cable car impossible. Other officials said a metal staircase of more than 10,000 steps went the length of the tunnel as an escape route, but was also impossible to use. Lang said the bodies of victims had been found behind, in front of and underneath the charred and twisted remains of the cable car. But 12 passengers were able to escape the inferno, when a man described as a burly Bavarian smashed a cable-car window and urged others to follow him through the window and down the tunnel to safety. Others not even in the cable car were less lucky. The driver of a cable car that was descending the tunnel at the same time was burned to death by hot smoke and flames sucked up the tunnel by the draft. Three people waiting for the next cable car at the station atop the line were similarly burned to death. Schausberger said the rescue work would continue through the night. He said the workers were entering the tunnel from above and through an emergency shaft that leads into the tunnel about a third of the way down its mountain course. Other workers, he said, were busy seeking to secure the remains of the cable car. Because of possible damage to the cable that pulls it, there was a danger that the twisted remains could break loose and race down the track to the base, causing further damage, Schausberger said.

Austrian officials today begin the gruesome task of recovering the bodies of the estimated 155 people who perished in a rail tunnel disaster in Austria's Alps. Previous efforts were called off because of intense heat and bellowing smoke coming from the train, which was destroyed Saturday in a tunnel fire 100 kilometers Southwest of Salzburg. Reporter Stephan Boss has more on the story. The Governor of Salzburg province Francz Schalzburger said Sunday, that at least 165 people were trapped in the train when it caught fire after entering a more than three kilometer tunnel on the way up to the Kitzsteinhorn glacier ski slopes. Twelve skiers escaped the inferno by smashing their way out of the train and climbing downhill to safety. Mr. Schalzburger said the dead included dozens of Austrians and Germans, as well as Japanese tourists and American soldiers from a military base in nearby Germany. He said earlier that the victims included children and teenagers who wanted to participate in snowboard and ski festivities on the top of the mountain. Stephan Boss for VOA News, Budapest.

Sandra Schmitt, a freestyle skiing world champion from Germany, was among the victims of the cable car fire disaster in Austria. The German ski federation said on its Web site Monday that 19-year-old Schmitt and her parents died in the ski resort of Kaprun. Schmitt won the moguls world championship title last year and was the junior world champion this year. Four talented skiers, all born in 1987, and three federation coaches also died, the federation said. In addition, seven members of a ski club in the Bavarian resort of Chiemgau were among the victims.

After arguing for two days over how and when to start a new round of global trade talks, Pacific Rim ministers agreed Monday that the WTO should first come up with an agenda that takes into account the needs of poor nations. The agreement came after foreign and trade ministers from the 21 members of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum struggled to bridge a gap between the needs of developed and developing nations. In a compromise, APEC ministers stopped short of calling for World Trade Organization talks to begin next year, as the United States, Australia, Japan and others were seeking. Instead, they set 2001 as the deadline for agreeing on an agenda, which developing countries led by Malaysia are insisting on before they negotiate. A final statement urged new trade talks by ``the earliest available opportunity.'' APEC ministers encouraged WTO members ``to muster the political will'' to first agree on an agenda in 2001, taking into account the needs of poorer countries. The ministers also said current high oil prices threaten economic development and called for more research into alternative fuels. Some clung to the possibility that APEC leaders, including President Clinton, could still adopt the 2001 deadline for starting WTO talks when they hold their annual summit beginning Wednesday. Developing countries led by Malaysia want to make sure the West cannot put environmental protection and labor standards on the table _ which they say would harm their ability to compete globally by exploiting their main assets: natural resources and cheap labor. Those concerns and complaints that the Geneva-based WTO is unduly controlled by rich countries dashed efforts to launch a new round of trade talks last year in Seattle. That meeting ended with ministers divided and enemies of economic globalization rioting outside. With 139 members, the WTO was created in 1995 on the theory that open markets benefit everyone. Its binding decisions determine how trade is conducted between nations and what restrictions countries can impose to protect their own producers. The APEC economies, which represent half the world's output, can do no more than urge new WTO talks. But the meetings of the APEC ministers in Brunei on Sunday and Monday showed that the developing nations are refusing to cave in to the wishes of the West. Poor nations have long complained they are left out of crucial decision-making in global trade deals. Affluent Hong Kong agreed Monday, with Secretary of Commerce and Industry Chau Tak Hay branding the WTO ``a clubhouse for the wealthy nations.'' While Hong Kong is already a member of the WTO, China has been working to join it for 14 years. It is currently engaged in a dispute with Mexico, which is the only major WTO member that has not agreed on its entry terms. APEC was founded in 1989, and Clinton launched the annual meetings in 1993. APEC comprises the United States, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, China, Australia, New Zealand, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Mexico, Papua New Guinea, Peru, the Philippines, Russia, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam.

Environmental groups accused the United States on Monday of seeking loopholes to avoid cutting pollution, as a U.N. conference opened to set rules for reducing harmful gases released into the atmosphere. One major issue revolved around how much countries could trade off against their commitments to roll back their own pollution by helping other countries reduce theirs or by planting new forests to absorb greenhouse gases. The question pits the United States, which advocates unlimited emissions trading, against the European Union and some developing countries, which fear it will defeat the effort to force the biggest polluters to change their ways. ``Significant loopholes and accounting tricks are being proposed by the U.S. delegation,'' a coalition of environmental groups said. ``The oil industry certainly wants to exploit every loophole, which will be the noose around nature's neck,'' said Jennifer Morgan of the World Wildlife Fund. The United States argues that emissions trading is the most cost-effective way to meet the global target of reducing greenhouse gases by 5.2 percent from 1990 levels, and would give a breathing space for the transition to cleaner energy and expensive new technologies. Under the imperative banner ``Work it out,'' about 6,000 bureaucrats, scientists, environmentalists and businessmen attended the opening. That number was expected to grow to 10,000 during the second week with the arrival of about 100 government ministers for the culmination of negotiations. Months of talks preceded the conference, setting the stage for what conference chairman Jan Pronk hoped would be the concessions. ``I feel there is a positive inclination by governments to reach success. But I also am aware that the positions are very far apart,'' he said. Three years ago in Kyoto, Japan, governments drew up targets and a rough outline for rolling back emissions of carbon-based gases but could not agree on the details. Europe agreed to cut emissions by 8 percent, the United States by 7 percent and Japan by 6 percent. Each country was allowed to decide how it would make the required reductions. So far, 30 countries have ratified the Kyoto Protocol. Mexico is the most industrialized country on the list, and none is among the heaviest polluting countries. The agreement needs the ratification of 55 countries, representing at least 55 percent of the harmful emissions, before it will come into force. In an opening statement Monday, U.S. delegate David Sandalow affirmed the U.S. commitment to ``making real progress here and now and to shaping a treaty that can be ratified.'' Implicitly rejecting allegations the United States is avoiding real emissions reductions, Sandalow said the U.S. economy was growing at 4 percent a year but emissions were increasing by about 1 percent. Adding to the sense of urgency in reaching an agreement is recent flooding on the European continent and Britain, which some scientists attribute partially to global warming. Robert Watson, head of the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, set the challenge before the delegates with a stark review of the earth's climate, which he said had been stable since the last Ice Age until well into the 20th century. ``The weight of scientific evidence suggests that the observed changes in the Earth's climate are, at least in part, due to human activities,'' he said. In the next 100 years, he said, deserts will become drier, crops will decrease in areas like Africa and Latin America, forests will become more vulnerable to pests and disease, coral reefs will die and rising seas will cause the displacement of tens of millions of people.

Rescue workers in Austria have recovered the bodies of more than 40 victims of Saturday's fire in an Alpine train tunnel. Police say they now fear 159 people were killed in the blaze. Clare Duval reports. Battling the cold and the dark, rescue teams are slowly extracting the bodies of those killed in the Railway tunnel fire, inching forward deep into the Kitch Dine Horn mountain. They are close to the cable car itself. Its floor has melted, complicating the task of cutting out the victims trapped in entangled debris. The forensic examination of those bodies will be long and painstaking. Many are unrecognizable and can only be identified by DNA tests and dental records. Clare Duval, BBC News, Caproon, Austria.

Investigators revealed Tuesday that they found an oily substance on a mountain railway in Austria, offering the first possible clue as to what may have caused a cable car inferno that claimed at least 156 lives. Police criminal investigators refused to say what sort of suspicious material they discovered on the ramp leading to the mountain tunnel where the cable car caught fire Saturday. Christian Tisch, a police forensic technician, said the material was being chemically analyzed and that it appeared to be similar in consistency to lubricants. ``The material looks as though it may have dropped from the vehicle,'' Tisch said. He declined further comment on the substance, but said that before the train entered the tunnel ``defects may have occurred.'' Despite the new clue, the cause of the deadly fire in the cable car remained uncertain. The Salzburg prosecutor's office is investigating the disaster to determine if criminal charges could be filed. Investigators combed the floor of the tunnel Tuesday, searching centimeter by centimeter for traces of human remains to help identify victims of the inferno. Dozens of rescue workers battled against fatigue and exhaustion to pull bodies from the tunnel, working through the second straight night to try to recover as many as possible. Strong winds were predicted for later Tuesday, which could slow efforts to fly the bodies to Salzburg. That would slow the already painstaking task of identifying the badly burned remains. Experts had begun collecting toothbrushes and razor blades in hopes of finding DNA samples that matched with the bodies. Investigators don't yet know how many people perished in the inferno. Though authorities had believed at least 159 people died, they lowered that number on Tuesday to 156. Even then, they added the caveat that perhaps four more victims might yet be identified. The cable car had a turnstile counting system, but officials say that children and teen-agers sometimes slip under the barrier, making that count subject to question. The intensity of the fire left the bodies so badly charred that they could not be recognized, said chief forensic pathologist Edith Tutsch-Bauer. Details about the accident continued to emerge Tuesday. A group of survivors belonging to a German ski club in Vilseck, Germany, issued a statement saying they heard two strong explosions while they were in the tunnel. The blasts apparently occurred after they managed to scramble out of the compartment and run away from the car. Soon afterward, the cable pulling the car broke and sparks were shooting past them, the statement said. ``Each one in the group was in panic, fearing that the burning train could get loose and crash down the flight path,'' the statement said. Lists of victims were mostly complete by Monday, primarily by identifying those left unaccounted for among skiers and snowboarders on the glacier slope Saturday. But the identification of bodies could take up to four weeks, said Tutsch-Bauer. Those missing and presumed dead include eight Americans, including a family of four and two soldiers who became engaged last week. Officials said 18 people survived _ 12 who saved themselves from the cable car after they broke its window with a ski and six who had been waiting at the top of the tunnel. One was in serious condition, the others were released from the hospital Sunday. The disaster was believed to be the worst involving skiers being transported by cable car. Two Austrian cable cars resembling the one on that caught fire on Kitzsteinhorn have been halted for safety checks.

Mounting evidence links Osama Bin Laden to acts of terrorism against the United States, which is putting more pressure on the Taliban to surrender him. But analysts say the accused terrorist is just part of an intricate puzzle enveloping Central Asia. Many forces are at work in the region including Russian ambitions and it's hard to sort them all out though analysts are trying. VOA's Ed Warner presents some of their wildly varying views. New evidence implicates Osama Bin Laden in the 1998 bombings of US embassies in Africa, say two American specialists on counter terrorism. Writing in the New York Times, Milt Beardin and Larry Johnson note that in pleading guilty to his role in the bombings, a former US army Sergeant admitted Osama was also involved. In their opinion, that should be enough evidence to satisfy the Taliban who could then release him for trial in an Islamic court in another country. But will they? Although they have been engaged in talks with US officials, they have shown little sign of budging on Osama Bin Laden or on any other issue. Wanoden Hyder, Interior Minister of Pakistan, which supports the Taliban says the Taliban has not returned several Pakistani terrorists who took refuge in Afghanistan. In an interview with VOA, Under Secretary of State Thomas Pickering said the United States is cooperating with Russia to bring pressure on the Taliban. We agreed on the need to impose additional United Nations sanctions against the Taliban principally because they failed to comply with resolution 1267 and send Osama Bin Laden to a place where he can be brought to justice and because they have continued to support in Afghanistan terrorism. In that battle, we are prepared to go and work with whoever it is, who is prepared to help in the fight, whether it is Russia or Pakistan or India or Saudi Arabia or whoever. Mr. Pickering added that the United States does not object to Russian troops providing security in Tajikistan, just north of the fighting in Afghanistan. That is questionable security counters Vladimir Socor, Senior Analyst of the Washington-based James Stone Foundation. Speaking from his post in Munich, Germany, he notes the Russian effort to regain control of Central Asia. Russian policy does not seek stability. The key concept here is that of controlled instability. As in other parts of the former Soviet Union or on the borders of the former Soviet Union, the Russian policy is based on this concept of controlled instability, which implies exploiting local conflicts in order to enable Russia to emerge as a political and military arbiter. Mr. Socor says Russia is aiding anti-Taliban forces in Northern Afghanistan to keep Central Asia in turmoil and thus weaken Uzbekistan, its main rival in the region. Uzbekistan has been improving its relations with the Taliban and along with Turkmenistan argues that Afghanistan is not making any kind of trouble across its border. That point was emphasized by former Foreign Minister of Turkmenistan Boris Shikhmuradov at a meeting in Washington. Many visits to Afghanistan have persuaded him that the Taliban want peaceful relations with their neighbors after all the exhausting years of war. This problem cannot be resolved by sanctions against the Taliban or any other Afghan government. The only way to deal with this conflict is by dialogue and cooperation with the international community. The Taliban have agreed to do this through the United Nations. Others are more skeptical, but Mr. Shikhmuradov said he had the advantage of meeting with Mullah Omar, the reclusive Taliban leader. He is not a great conversationalist, the minister conceded, and he has strong convictions, but he is willing to listen and even encourage tourism according to reports. Three months ago, he issued a decree to preserve two famous giant Buddhist statues, which the Taliban had planned to destroy. The US government says flatly the Taliban continues to harbor other terrorist groups along with Osama Bin Laden. In the far eastern economic review, Pakistani journalist and author Ahmed Rasheed writes that by forbidding legitimate opposition, the repressive Central Asian governments have given rise to Islamic militants determined to overthrow them. Some of these are based in Afghanistan. Mr. Rasheed cites the Islamic movement of Uzbekistan, which he says has 3,000 heavily armed fighters in Afghanistan. But this is disputed by Vladimir Socor who says the Islamic movement of Uzbekistan launch their attacks on Uzbekistan from Tajikistan with Russian connivance. He insists Tajikistan, not Afghanistan is the main source of instability in Central Asia. At the least, say bewildered observers, the so-called great game of the 19th century, the British-Russian rivalry was simplicity itself compared to today's Central Asian complexities.

President Clinton will deliver the keynote address at the Annual Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Summit, which opens today in Brunei. Mr. Clinton is among 20 Pacific Rim leaders on hand for the two-day forum. He hopes this session will produce a call for a new round of global trade talks. Later this week Vietnam by a US President since the end of the Vietnam war. VOA's David Gallus reports from Brunei. The President is making his farewell appearance at the annual APEC Summit, which he founded in 1993 when he had brought regional leaders together for the first meeting at Blake Island in Washington State. The goal of APEC continues to be a free trade area around the Pacific Rim, though progress has slowed in recent years and US efforts are focused now on convening a new round of trade liberalization negotiations in the World Trade Organization next year. On the sidelines of the trade talks, Mr. Clinton will have several bilateral meetings including what will likely be his final encounters as President with Russian President Vladimir Putin and China's Jiang Zemin. Mr. Clinton flies to Vietnam late Thursday for a visit that caps a normalization process with Hanoi that began early in his administration and included the conclusion of a sweeping trade agreement in July.

President Clinton, at a farewell summit in Asia, assured world leaders Wednesday the United States is unshaken by the election impasse at home. ``The world can rest easy,'' he declared, adding that both Al Gore and George W. Bush support expanded trade and a global economy. ``This has been a rather interesting week in the United States,'' he said. The president spoke to business leaders at the Empire Hotel and Country Club, an opulent resort on Jerudong Beach on the South China Sea. It is one of the most extravagant buildings in Brunei, built with Italian marble and 24-carat gold inlays in wall panels. ``After I saw this facility I did not believe this was a small economy,'' Clinton joked. Clinton was meeting with 20 Pacific Rim leaders at the annual Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum. He also was talking on the sidelines with the leaders of Russia, China, Japan and South Korea. Around the world the U.S. election dispute, whose outcome hinges on the vote count in Florida, has confounded many people. The president talked lightheartedly about the election. ``One of the things that I think we have learned is that we should all be very careful about making predictions about the future,'' the president said. ``I know I can safely predict this will be my last APEC summit. I just don't know who will be here next year.'' Asked what he would do after leaving the White House, Clinton noted the election of his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, to the Senate. ``Now I have a United States senator to support. I understand that's an expensive proposition,'' he joked. More seriously, Clinton said he wants to be ``a useful citizen of both my country and the world'' and pursue efforts to make the world a better place. However, he said he would ``do it in a way that does not get in the way of my successor. The United States can have only one president at a time,'' he said. But he added with a smile, ``I'll be around.'' In his remarks, Clinton stressed the importance of open markets and societies and called for the start of a new round of global trade talks next year. He said that both Gov. George W. Bush and Vice President Al Gore were committed to a more integrated global economy and expanded trade. ``On the question of leadership for trade,'' Clinton said, ``the world can rest easy because both our candidates made strong commitments to do that.'' In his meeting with leaders, Clinton was prepared to talk about the election. ``The president will express his confidence that this is proceeding under the rule of law and in conjunction with set procedures that exist at our state level and that it is democracy in action,'' National Security Council spokesman P.J. Crowley said. ``Meanwhile, our government remains open for business, and he is out here at APEC doing the country's business,'' Crowley said. The president was accompanied by his daughter, Chelsea, and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright as he arrived the opulent Empire Hotel to address business leaders. Clinton's visit to Brunei, an oil-rich sultanate in northern Borneo in the South China Sea, is the prelude to a visit to Vietnam, the first by an American president since 1969. On the sidelines, Clinton will meet privately with Russian President Vladimir Putin and South Korean President Kim Dae-jung on Wednesday. He will see Chinese President Jiang Zemin and Japanese Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori on Thursday. ``The president will be very much focusing on reinforcing the benefits of an open global economy'' as Asia begins to regain its footing from financial crisis, said Gene Sperling, director of the National Economic Council. When the leaders gathered in Malaysia two years ago, there was much to worry about. Indonesia had a minus-13 percent growth and South Korea had a minus-7 percent. But now, Sperling said, ``You look at dramatic turnarounds in most of these countries where now they are looking at their second year of positive growth.'' He said the United States would press its case for a moratorium on customs duties on Internet commerce. But the high point of the trip will be Clinton's visits to Hanoi, the capital of a unified Vietnam, and to Ho Chi Minh City, formerly Saigon. The trip beginning Thursday is the first ever to a unified Vietnam by an American president. It comes 25 years after U.S.-backed South Vietnam surrendered to North Vietnam, leaving in doubt the fate of many Americans classified as missing in action. Clinton said he hoped his trip would open ``a new page in our relationship with Vietnam. And hopefully one that will put an end to the divisions between the Vietnamese people and the American people'' and within the United States and Vietnam.

Clouds high in the Austrian Alps delayed efforts Wednesday to recover the last bodies from the melted remains of the cable car that caught fire in a mountain tunnel, killing 156. After two days of helicopter flights shuttling 128 bodies to a forensic clinic in Salzburg, pilots were waiting for weather to improve before resuming. Rescuers were working through the night to free the remaining bodies, some of which were buried beneath debris or fused to parts of the rail cars. Forensic experts in Salzburg plan to use DNA testing and dental records to try to identify the badly burned remains of those killed in Saturday's accident. Identification could take weeks, experts said. Pilots also had to struggle Tuesday with stormy weather and gusty winds, said Austrian army Commander Roland Ertl. ``They were extreme conditions,'' Ertl said, adding that ``it isn't easy to fly anyway with this job.'' The cause of the worst accident on record linked to mountain sports remained unclear four days after the car burst into flames while taking skiers to the slopes on Kitzsteinhorn mountain. But new details emerged Tuesday: Investigators spoke of a possible defect having occurred before the train entered the steep tunnel inside the mountain Saturday morning, and survivors told of explosions shortly after flames enveloped the car. Christian Tisch, a police forensic technician, said police had found an oily substance that appeared to have dripped from the car on the ramp leading into the tunnel. The car stopped some 600 yards inside. Tisch said the material was being chemically analyzed and it appeared to be similar in consistency to lubricants. Meanwhile, skiing club members from the southern German town of Vilseck said in a statement they heard two ``loud explosions, one immediately after the other,'' shortly after they clambered out through a broken window and began running toward the tunnel entrance. Almost immediately afterward, one of the two steel cables used to pull the car upward broke and shot by them ``throwing off sparks.'' ``Each one in the group was in panic, fearing that the burning train could get loose and crash down the flight path,'' the statement said. In separate comments, Austrian Regina Rammer told state television that the cable car she took _ apparently the one before the car that caught fire _ stopped briefly and without explanation once inside the tunnel. She then heard knocking ``like that of a hammer on a pipe.'' The Salzburg prosecutor's office is investigating the disaster to determine if criminal charges could be filed. Investigators remained tightlipped about possible causes, citing legal considerations and a lack of firm clues. ``There is no incriminating evidence,'' said Franz Lang, chief of Salzburg's criminal police. ``This matter is completely, completely open.'' After days of efforts to trace the identity of those missing after the tragedy, investigators said they were confident that the death toll _ initially believed to be around 170 _ was in fact lower. ``We are talking with a very, very high degree of probability about a figure of 156,'' Lang said. But the identification of bodies could take up to four weeks because the intensity of the fire left them so badly charred as to be unrecognizable. Five members of a U.S. Army forensics unit in Germany have joined the recovery and identification mission, said Army spokesman Capt. Paul Swiergosz. Those missing and presumed dead include eight Americans, among them a family of four and two soldiers who became engaged last week. The missing family _ Maj. Michael C. Goodridge, 36; Jennifer Goodridge, 35; and their sons, 7-year-old Michael and 5-year-old Kyle _ was based in Germany. At the Wuerzburg Elementary School that Michael attended, classmates remembered their missing friend with drawings and letters, stacking his desk in the second-grade classroom with crayon tributes depicting him playing on swings or with his guinea pig. ``I wish that there was a path, and you didint go on the trane'' one of Michael's classmates wrote, with a second grader's imperfect spelling. The accident sent a chill through Europe, where the ski season is about to begin. In parts of the continent, safety checks on rail and cable car systems were stepped up Tuesday. But other officials said the cause of the fire in Austria must be determined before experts can say whether other vehicles pose similar risks.

President Clinton cited humanitarian grounds in asking Russian President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday to release an American accused of spying in Russia, an administration official said. The prisoner, Edmond Pope, 54, a lawyer from State College, Pa., was arrested April 3 by the Federal Security Service in Moscow on suspicion of trying to buy secret blueprints for a high-speed torpedo. If convicted in a secret trial, he could be sentenced to up to 20 years in prison. Pope waited six months in Moscow's Lefortovo prison for the trial to open last month. Pope's family says he has a rare form of bone cancer, which was in remission when he traveled to Russia earlier this year. Clinton and Putin were in Brunei for the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum. They met for 75 minutes over lunch on Wednesday. The administration official, briefing reporters on condition his name not be used, said the Pope case came up in their discussions. ``As he has before, the president expressed his concern about Mr. Pope's condition, in particular his health,'' the official said. ``We're concerned about the course of the trial and the president again urged the release of Mr. Pope on humanitarian grounds as soon as possible.'' Asked what Putin replied, the official said only that ``the Russians understand that we won't rest until Edmond Pope is home, that we are deeply concerned about his condition. ``We think President Putin understands these concerns and hope he acts on them as soon as possible,'' the official said.

President Hosni Mubarak's ruling party comfortably held its majority in parliament but the opposition made gains in Egyptian elections, according to preliminary results published Wednesday. In voting marred by the killing of 10 people and charges of irregularities, the National Democratic Party won a preliminary total of 312 of the legislature's 444 elected seats. Independent candidates won 95 seats, but most of them are expected to declare their allegiance to the ruling party, as happened after 1995 legislative elections. Legal opposition parties took 16 seats, and nominally independent candidates backed by the outlawed Muslim Brotherhood won 17 seats. That adds up to only 33 seats if the preliminary results stand _ a tiny minority in the legislature, but about twice as many as the groups controlled before. Votes were still being counted in two seats where runoffs between the two leading candidates were held Tuesday. The polls in two other constituencies have been postponed by court order. Final runoffs were held Tuesday in more than 50 districts, and clashes between opposition supporters and police erupted at several polling stations. Five people were killed and 40 wounded when police fired bullets and tear gas. The violence erupted after police blocked supporters of independent and opposition candidates from entering polling stations. Similar clashes between security forces and frustrated voters occurred during earlier voting in the three-stage elections, which began Oct. 18. The Muslim Brotherhood, which wants to turn Egypt into an Islamic state, said it would have won more seats if security forces had not prevented its supporters from voting. And legal opposition parties used their newspapers to decry the conduct of the polling. ``Flagrant bias by the security forces in favor of the National party,'' declared a headline in Al-Wafd, the newspaper of the liberal Wafd party, which won only six seats. ``Runoff conducted under tight security siege,'' said a headline in Al-Ahrar, the paper of the Liberal Party, which took one seat. The government has denied interfering in the elections and said the violence sprang from rivalry among the candidates' supporters. The NDP held 97 percent of the outgoing parliament. The 1995 elections, which were also marred by allegations of rigging and violence, left 87 people dead and more than 1,500 wounded, according to official figures.

A government commission testified in an espionage trial Wednesday that torpedo design plans obtained by an American businessman were classified _ as prosecutors allege. The testimony in Edmond Pope's trial came as President Clinton asked Russian President Vladimir Putin during a meeting in Brunei to release Pope on humanitarian grounds. Pope has bone cancer which is in remission, but his family says it is flaring up again, and the court has repeatedly refused his requests to see an English-speaking doctor. Pope is being tried in a closed court on charges he sought to obtain classified plans for a high-tech Russian submarine torpedo. Pope denies the charges, saying the information had already been sold abroad and wasn't secret. But Georgy Logvinovich, a member of the expert commission, said Wednesday, ``We again concluded that the materials were secret and had the most direct link to all programs for developing the Shkval'' torpedo, according to the Interfax news agency. Commission member Yuri Fadeyev added, ``They were never declassified and we don't plan to declassify them.'' When Pope initially requested the materials, another group of experts determined that the materials were not secret. But then the government commission was formed to review the case, and concluded that the plans, parts of which Pope received before his arrest, were in fact classified. The commission confirmed that finding in its testimony Wednesday, according to Russian news reports. Defense lawyer Pavel Astakhov said the government commission experts are biased because they have worked closely with the material in question. The U.S. government has urged Pope's release, saying the authorities have failed to show Pope did anything illegal. One of his key accusers has recanted a statement that implicated him in espionage. A U.S. consular official was allowed to have a rare meeting with Pope in Moscow's Lefortovo prison on Tuesday. Interfax said they discussed Pope's health and prison conditions. U.S. officials gave no details of the meeting. Pope, 54, of State College, Pa., is a retired U.S. Navy officer who founded CERF Technologies International, a company specializing in studying foreign maritime equipment.

A U.S. proposal to grant emissions credits for programs to expand or protect pollution-absorbing forests and crops drew stiff resistance Wednesday at a United Nations conference on curbing global warming. European delegates and environmentalists predicted that ``sinks'' may be the most critical issue to be resolved during the two-week climate conference, which seeks agreements on programs to cut emissions of greenhouse gases over the next 12 years. ``Sinks'' is the term used to describe plants, soil and trees that absorb airborne carbon, thus reducing the amount of carbon in the atmosphere. The United States has proposed that countries be allowed to accrue emissions credits for sinks, counting them against the amount of greenhouse gases they are committed to reduce under the 1997 Kyoto Protocol. For the United States, sinks would cover half its target of cutting emissions by 7 percent from 1990 levels by the year 2012. U.S. officials said they were seeking to include not only new forestation projects, but also to earn credit for preserving existing vegetation. That would involve little more than fencing off forests and calculating how much carbon they absorb, officials acknowledged. The amount would then be subtracted from the emissions output, even though there is no actual cut in emissions. Delegates from the European Union said they would stand firm against the proposal. Anders Turessou of Sweden said many industrialized countries have such extensive vegetation they could ``hide completely their commitments by using sinks.'' With its vast pine forests, Sweden could meet one-third of its reduction commitment without doing anything, he said. U.S. officials said they will seek a five year phase-in of sinks between 2008 and 2012, during which they want partial credit for their carbon-absorbing projects. Under the Kyoto Protocol, industrialized countries will reduce the total output of heat-trapping gases by an average 5.2 percent between 2008-2012 compared with 1900 levels. Most of the details on how countries should do that were left undecided. The protocol would allow credit for new forestation but not for existing vegetation or new farming techniques. ``The U.S. proposal makes a farce of the Kyoto Protocol,'' said World Wildlife Fund spokeswoman Jennifer Morgan. ``It gives them a license that makes them look green on paper. It is in fact rewriting the Kyoto Protocol.'' The problem with using forests for carbon dioxide absorption is that they are not permanent, she said. If trees are cut or burned, the carbon is released back into the atmosphere. But not all environmentalists agree that sinks have no value. The Washington-based Nature Conservancy has overseen a deal in Bolivia in which foreign companies bought the logging rights to 1.5 million acres for $10 million. The forest will be attached to an adjacent national park, and the companies expect to share credits of 7 million tons of carbon emissions. ``Forests have an economic value,'' said spokesman Douglas Meyer. ``If you can give carbon a higher value than logging, someone will pay you to keep your forest intact.'' Robert Bonnie of the Environmental Defense Group said counting sinks also could give farmers new incentives to grow environmentally friendly crops. ``This could be the theme that takes negotiators into the early hours next week,'' said Bonnie. The United States contributes one-quarter of global carbon dioxide emissions, with output jumping 11 percent in the past decade. Government forecasts say the United States will need to reduce emissions by a third if they are to meet the Kyoto target.

The 14-year-old Mir space station will be ditched in February in a controlled descent that will send it hurtling into a remote area of the Pacific Ocean, officials decided Thursday. The decision to abandon the ailing space station was taken at a meeting of the Russian Cabinet. Officials have wrestled for months over what to do with the Mir, which Moscow can no longer afford to maintain. The Cabinet approved a plan to crash the Mir into the Pacific east of Australia sometime around February. Officials decided to discard the 140-ton, 14-year-old station _ once a symbol of Soviet space glory _ after attempts failed to find private investors to come up with the money to keep it in orbit. The government decided to abandon the Mir earlier this year, but extended its lifetime after the private Netherlands-based MirCorp leased time on Mir and paid for its operation. MirCorp has pledged to raise more funds to keep the station aloft, but the government has grown increasingly skeptical about the company's ability to do so. Prime Minister Mikhail Kasyanov said Thursday that it is Russia's international commitment to safely discard the Mir. ``One of our obligations is to ensure the safety of the final stage of the Mir's flight,'' he said. In calling for careful preparation for deorbiting the Mir, Russian Space agency chief Yuri Koptev on Wednesday recalled a Soviet satellite that crashed into northern Canada in 1978, in a major embarrassment for the Soviet leadership. Nobody was hurt but radioactive fragments were scattered over the wilderness. The unoccupied U.S. Skylab space station fell to Earth in 1979 when its orbit deteriorated faster than anticipated, scattering debris over western Australia. No one was hurt. A likely scenario for lowering the Mir's orbit safely involves a cargo ship docking with the station, and then firing rockets to push the station quickly into the atmosphere over an unpopulated area. Officials have said they may send up a new crew to the Mir in January to prepare the craft for the final descent. The Mir cluster of six modules, bristling with solar panels and antennas, has far outlived engineers' original expectations. The inside is scarred by a 1997 fire and one module, Spektr, is sealed off after a collision that year with a small craft ferrying away the station's garbage. NASA has urged Russia to dump the Mir and concentrate its scarce resources on the new international space station, a 16-nation project led by the United States but using some Russian technology developed on Mir.

The halls of Inawashiro Junior High School are somber. Some students cry in corridors. Others have curled up on mattresses or locked themselves in rooms. The deaths of five classmates _ star skiers with Olympic dreams _ in an Austrian cable car inferno have plunged the school in northeastern Japan into mourning. ``We are trying to get things back to normal as soon as possible,'' principal Norio Iwahashi said Thursday. ``The students are in shock.'' The 155 people killed in the Alpine tunnel are presumed to include coach Okihiko Deguchi; his 13-year-old daughter, Nao; and Masanobu Onodera, Tomohisa Saze, Tomoko Wakui, Ayaka Katono _ all 14. Japanese television news closely followed the progress of rescue efforts after the ski resort blaze Saturday. Relatives of the Japanese victims _ 10 Japanese were believed to be on the cable car _ lighted candles at a requiem mass in Austria. An editorial in the mass-circulation Asahi Shimbun could merely muster a litany of questions: ``What about the emergency systems? Were there procedures for guiding passengers in an emergency and escape exits from the tunnel? Weren't there working fire extinguishers?'' Austrian investigators have focused on whether a technical malfunction caused the worst disaster ever suffered by that country's multimillion dollar skiing industry. The cable car burst into flames while taking skiers to the slopes on Kitzsteinhorn mountain in Kaprun, Austria. Japanese ski resorts usually don't get much snow until December, so tours to Europe for elite student skiers have been gaining in popularity. An employee of tour organizer Ogasaka Ski described the teen-agers' excitement before their departure. ``There were kids who were going abroad for the first time,'' said Mitsuhiko Otsuka. ``They left Japan with their hearts filled with hope about the chance to train and learn from Deguchi and just ski.'' The young Japanese victims were training for Japan's national skiing competition. Two college students, Saori Mitsumoto and Ryoko Narahara, both 22, had been struggling just to qualify for the tournament. But the junior high school students _ from a school with one of Japan's most successful skiing programs _ had bigger ambitions. ``They all dreamed about competing in the Olympics,'' Otsuka said. Japan has a long skiing tradition. But it is only recently that Japanese skiers _ benefiting from more professional training programs _ have been picking up Olympic medals. The students were thrilled by the chance to be taught by Deguchi, a successful pro who won the All Japan Collegiate Championship when he was a student. Iwahashi and Otsuka said he was a kind man _ who was also hard as nails when it came to teaching skiing. ``He was a great leader,'' said Iwahashi. ``He was so dedicated to teaching the kids.'' Despite the Kaprun tragedy, Otsuka said his company has no intention to stop organizing overseas tours for promising young Japanese skiers. ``This sort of thing is unprecedented,'' he said. ``Rather than rethink the program, we want to continue creating opportunities for kids who want to improve their skills and challenge the world.''

More than a quarter century after a war that cost 58,000 American lives and shaped the politics of his generation, President Clinton arrived here Thursday night promising a new relationship with Vietnam, a country that is at once fascinated by its former enemy and deeply ambivalent about opening its society and economy to a world that America dominates. As he stepped into the cool nighttime air here, with barely two months left in office, Clinton became the first president to set foot in Vietnam since Richard Nixon made an unscheduled six-hour visit to U.S. troops outside Saigon in 1969, and the only one to visit Hanoi, which as the headquarters the North Vietnamese command was the target of countless U.S. bombing sorties. Clinton opposed the war as a young man, and did not serve in the military. But on this trip he plans to focus resolutely on the future. He has made Vietnam a test case of his proposition that deepening commercial ties create a powerful gravitational pull that can draw former enemies, even hard-line communist governments, into gradual alignment with the West. It is still far from clear that experiment will work here. Thursday night, Air Force One lazily descended through the same skies where B-52s once flew, coming in low over rice paddies that once were dotted with bomb craters, and now bear billboards advertising Korean-made cars and electronics. A motorcade sped the president over the Red River into one of Asia's most gracious capitals, where people began to line the streets in groups of a dozen or so, almost none of them old enough to remember the war. By just before midnight the crowd grew to thousands as Clinton, in a limousine bearing Washington, D.C. license plates, drove by on the way to his hotel, just a mile or so from the simple house where Ho Chi Minh and his generals prosecuted the war. But that carefully-preserved site, one of the city's most-visited attractions, and the mausoleum nearby where Ho's body is on display, have been carefully omitted from Clinton's three-day itinerary. So have most other reminders of the past. Save for a trip Saturday morning to a site where investigators believe they have just found the remains of a U.S. pilot whose plane crashed outside the city 35 years ago _ one of 1,499 Americans still unaccounted for in Vietnam _ the White House has said Clinton will not be looking back at the war. On Friday Clinton will be greeted by President Tran Duc Luong and will give a speech at Hanoi National University that Vietnamese officials have just announced they will broadcast nationwide. Besides Hanoi, Clinton will also visit Ho Chi Minh City, the former Saigon, before leaving Vietnam on Sunday. What little he has said on this trip suggests that Clinton's time as president _ and the decisions he has had to make about military interventions _ has led him to think differently about the hard choices, from bombing the north to expanding the U.S. military presence here, that President Lyndon Johnson made. ``I see now how hard it was for him,'' Clinton said the other day, on his way to Brunei. ``I believe he did what he thought was right under the circumstances.'' The president added: ``One of the things that I have learned, too, is when you decide to employ force, there will always be unintended consequences.'' Asked if America owes Vietnam is owed an apology, though, he quickly said: ``No, I don't,'' and left it at that. Instead, he wants to focus on Vietnam's economic and political potential. In Brunei during an economic summit, Clinton noted that this year, for the first time, Vietnam is the chair of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, or ASEAN, ``which means it is heading an organization that was invented to contain it.'' Clinton was preceded here earlier Thursday by his wife, Senator-elect Hillary Rodham Clinton, D-N.Y., who went shopping on one of Hanoi's main streets and drew a crowd of hundreds of curious residents. On Friday, Mrs. Clinton is scheduled to visit a village outside of Hanoi. President Clinton will spend a considerable part of the visit celebrating the results of his seven-year-long effort to draw Vietnam out of its self-imposed economic isolation, and his bet that both Vietnam and China will discover that prosperity in the information age necessitates a measure of political openness and the free flow of information. (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) In fact, Clinton and the U.S. ambassador here, Pete Peterson, a former prisoner of war in the now-demolished Hanoi Hilton, argue that personal freedoms have improved since the administration made its overtures to the country in 1994. That year Clinton lifted the trade embargo that had been in place since the fall of Saigon 25 years ago. With the support of former POWs in Congress, including Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., he offered diplomatic recognition to Vietnam in 1995. He dispatched his secretary of state at the time, Warren Christopher, to lay the groundwork for a new relationship, and Christopher warned that economic reform was akin to ``a passage over a ravine. You cannot do it by taking several little steps; only one giant leap will get you across.'' The Vietnamese ignored him. It took five years to negotiate a comprehensive trade agreement that promises - but hardly guarantees - far more vigorous economic ties between the United States and a nation of 78 million. But in the interim many foreign companies that poured in here in the early 1990s have pulled up stakes in frustration. Peterson argues that U.S. executives overstate the difficulties of dealing with Vietnamese bureaucracy and corruption, but he acknowledged the other day that Clinton will ``see a country that is eight years old, not 4,000.'' (END OPTIONAL TRIM) Clinton arrives in the midst of a fierce division within the Vietnamese government over whether the prospect of reversing a huge decline in foreign investment by opening up the country is worth the threat to the Communist Party's rule. In an echo of the debate underway in China, Vietnam's top Communist leader, Le Kha Phieu. warned in February that the battle with the West continues, on battlefields that bear little resemblance to lush fields of Hue or the rocky harbor at Haiphong. ``They continue to seek ways to completely wipe out the remaining socialist countries and attack the movements for independence, democracy and social progress,'' he said. ``We should never relax our vigilance for a minute.'' So it is Clinton's challenge over the next three days to accomplish what John F. Kennedy, Lyndon Johnson and Richard Nixon could not achieve: To win the hearts and minds of the Vietnamese people.

Asia-Pacific leaders called Thursday for the launch of a new round of world trade talks next year. A Malaysian-led lobby of developing APEC-member nations had argued it would be pointless to hold a new round of WTO liberalization talks unless an agenda was agreed first. But the final APEC Summit communiqu issued Thursday in Brunei reflected the views of the United States and other leading economies, views that say globalization holds the greatest opportunity for the increase of living standards.

The European Union has amended its declared support for creation of a Palestinian state. A new statement on the matter was part of a final communiqu issued Thursday, at the end of a two-day Euro-Med conference in France between EU foreign ministers and their Mediterranean counter parts. VOA's Douglas Packshin has the story. In a statement the EU said it wanted to see a sovereign democratic Palestinian state established in the near future preferably by negotiation. The EU said such a state should be viable and peaceful. A similar declaration was made at an EU meeting in Berlin last year, but the new statement stresses the urgency of the matter. The development follows a tense two-day meeting in Marseilles, focussing on economic aid for mostly Arab-Southern Mediterranean states and Israel. Syria and Lebanon boycotted the gathering to protest Israel's participation. The meeting comes at a time of serious tensions in the Middle East, more than 200 people, almost all of them Palestinians have been killed in seven weeks of clashes between Israeli forces and Palestinian protestors. The violence has left the peace process in a shambles. Douglas Packshin for VOA News, Luxembourg.

Standing only a few feet from each other at a Little Saigon mall, John Lee and Doreen Ng were worlds apart when it came to their thoughts on President Clinton's visit to Vietnam. The 23-year-old Ng has hopes of improved economic relations between the United States and Vietnam: ``It's about money. The economy is good and younger people go back there all the time to look for opportunities.'' But for the 38-year-old Lee, there is lingering suspicion about any dealings with the communist government his family fled in 1979. ``How can he go there?'' said Lee, whose father was placed in a ``re-education camp'' in Vietnam. ``Of course, I think we should help the people. They are so poor. But not this way. Not with this visit.'' It is a divide that runs deep in Orange County's Little Saigon, home to 300,000 Vietnamese, the largest such community outside of Vietnam. It is a divide that was made all the more stark Thursday as Clinton became the first American president to visit Vietnam in the 25 years since the war ended with a communist takeover of South Vietnam. Clinton has said he hopes his meetings with top leaders will improve relations. He has already lifted a trade embargo and restored diplomatic relations. The two nations signed a sweeping trade agreement in July. Political passions run so high in Little Vietnam that anyone who says something favorable about Vietnam risks being branded a communist. Last year, protesters angrily denounced a Little Saigon store owner who hung a poster of North Vietnamese leader Ho Chi Minh in his window. In Little Saigon, news reports about Clinton's trip rank above the question of who will become the next president. Radio debates rage on the community's two leading stations, with some saying the trip is good for the economic future of the two countries and others calling it a communist conspiracy. The debate has spilled from the airwaves into Little Saigon's restaurants and other businesses. ``If you think the United States should normalize relations with Vietnam, then they call you a communist. If you think they shouldn't, they accuse you of not caring about human rights,'' said Westminster Councilman Tony Lam, 64, the first Vietnamese-American elected to public office in the United States. Lam, who owns the Viet Dong restaurant, advocates normalizing relations with Vietnam. ``We should turn the page of history and move away from the dark era,'' he said. ``I'm not forgetting the sacrifice of the U.S. soldiers and the Vietnamese people. I just feel we should not put hatred and suspicion in front of our eyes.'' An Ngoc, a 56-year-old customer dining at the restaurant, was quick to respond. ``I, too, want to help the people of Vietnam, but not at the price of helping the government,'' he said. ``They won't help the people. They will help themselves.'' Down the street at the Asian Garden Mall, where Lee and Ng offered their views, Cathy Tran said the real question is whether the trip will result in any benefit for the two countries. ``People talk, talk, talk,'' said Tran, owner of a music store at the mall. ``The people who make the decision haven't talked yet.''

while the presidential election makes history in this country, the president is making history overseas in vietnam. president clinton has become the first president since nixon to visit there. astounding considering he was an anti-war protester in the old days. he's now the first president ever to visit hanoi. jim maceda is traveling with the president and joins us from hanoi tonight. good evening to you. brian. as you can see it's already a bright and busy friday morning here in downtown hanoi. the president arrived on this historic trip late last night from brunei. and would believe he's already been upstaged by none other than his wife, hillary. the first u.s. to visit vietnam since the war and the first ever to land in the capital hanoi. accompanied by daughter chelsea, the greeting was proper if low cree key. no cheering crowds. the president headed straight for his hoteole hotel and a night's rest. on the route, many curious vietnamese caught a glimpse of the morked. but it was a much more emotional scene earlier in the day when first lady and senator-elect hillary clinton went shopping in downtown hanoi. she was met by a throng of vietnamese. the historic three-day visit is seen by both sides as a way of healing old wounds. clinton will address university students in a speech to be broadcast live on vietnamese tv. it will ease the pain caused by america during the war and also he us find a partner with whom we can do business. high on clinton's agenda, bringing together vietnamese and the scores of u.s. business leaders accompanying him, trying to build on the success of a free trade agreement signed last july but still not vat fied. he'll lead two business forums in ho chi minh city. formerly saigon, in the more entrepreneurial south the and some 1,500 u.s. servicemen are still missing and a full accounting is needed, says clinton, to fornl a new u.s.-vietnamese relationship. but despite the historic nature of this trip, compounded by the fact that as a young man, of course president clinton was against the war in vietnam, still for those of us here covering this one has the impression it is totally overshadowed by the other war, the war of baments going on back home. jim, we can confirm that back here. thank you very much.

President Clinton stood Friday beneath a huge bust of the legendary Ho Chi Minh, architect of the communist victory over U.S.-backed forces 25 years ago, and said that he was ``looking forward to building toward the future'' with Vietnam, America's one-time enemy. In a red-carpet ceremony, Clinton became the first U.S. president to visit Hanoi, the capital once bombed by American warplanes. He was welcomed by a military band and honor guard in the courtyard of the French-built presidential palace on Ba Dinh Square near the mausoleum honoring the late leader reverently known as Uncle Ho. ``I'm glad to be here,'' said Clinton, who led anti-war protests as a young man and resisted the draft. ``I'm looking forward to building toward the future. It was very moving this morning, this welcoming ceremony.'' The president posed for pictures with Vietnamese President Tran Duc Luong in a palace meeting room, sitting under a larger-than-life stone bust of Ho. The president's wife, Hillary, and daughter, Chelsea, joined him. Crowds of curious onlookers, some of them waving, stood three and four deep on the streets as Clinton's motorcade rode to the palace. A military band played the national anthems of the United States and Vietnam as Clinton and Luong stood under a canopied platform in the warm morning sun. ``I know that you have come a long way to Vietnam,'' Luong told his American guest. ``I hope that you are not very tired after the long trip and I hope the weather is suitable to you. I wish you all the best during this trip. I hope this trip will be very interesting for both countries.'' Clinton thanked him and said, ``I've been very moved by the friendliness of the people on the streets. It is a very good omen.'' Luong also congratulated Mrs. Clinton on her election to the Senate. ``We are all very happy,'' he said. Vietnamese officials told Clinton they were prepared to sign an international labor convention aimed at banning the worst forms of child labor abuse, White House spokesman Jake Siewert said. Clinton and Luong also were witnessing the signing of a scientific and technology pact covering issues such as flood-control management, marine research control and disease prevention. Another agreement dealt with labor issues such as skills training, worker safety and working with the disabled. On a visit stirring painful memories back home of America's long and most unpopular war, Clinton promised ``to build a different future'' with its former enemy. Clinton arrived in the communist capital late Thursday, the first U.S. president ever in Hanoi, a city once bombed by American warplanes. Thousands and thousands of Vietnamese were on the streets at midnight for a glimpse of Clinton's limousine and jammed the square in front of his hotel. ``This only happens once in a thousand years,'' said homemaker Tran Thi Lan, 50. Reaching out to a generation of students born after the war, Clinton planned to speak at Hanoi National University to describe his vision for a new chapter in U.S.-Vietnamese relations. State-run television, in an unprecedented move, was to broadcast the address live. More than 50 U.S. corporations sent executives to Vietnam during Clinton's visit in hopes of gaining a foothold in what they believe is a vast untapped market of 78 million people. As a young man, Clinton ``opposed and despised'' the Vietnam War, organized protest marches and avoided the military draft. As commander in chief three decades later, Clinton acknowledged that ``A lot of people still bear the wounds of war'' in both countries. The war cost 58,000 American lives and tore the nation with suffering and turmoil. The U.S. military buildup began in 1961, growing to 60,000 combat troops within four years and to 543,000 by 1969. U.S. forces in 1973 made a humiliating withdrawal that still haunts the Pentagon. North Vietnam's army captured Saigon in 1975, leading to the unification of the country under communist control. The losses to the Vietnamese people were staggering: 3 million dead and thousands missing. ``The best thing that we can do to honor the sacrifice and service of those who believed on both sides that what they were doing is right, is to find a way to build a different future, and that's what we're trying to do,'' Clinton said in an interview with The Associated Press. In a cautious rapprochement, Clinton lifted a trade embargo against Vietnam in 1994 and the next year restored diplomatic relations. He opened the U.S. Embassy in Hanoi in 1996 and in 1998 issued his first waiver of a law that bars trade relations with communist nations that deny citizens the right to emigrate. In July, the United States and Vietnam signed a sweeping trade agreement. ``I think it's a new chapter,'' Clinton said. ``The thing that makes America work over time is our ability to visualize new futures and achieve them.'' Even as Washington and Hanoi look to the future, the United States still searches for missing servicemen and pursues rumors of Americans left behind when the last known POWs went home. Clinton said that ``so far all the rumors and all the leads have turned up dead ends.'' The United States lists 1,992 Americans unaccounted for from the war. The Pentagon has stopped pursuing 646 of the cases, and the rest remain open. Clinton on Saturday will go to a rice paddy outside Hanoi where experts are trying to recover remains at a site where it is believed Air Force Capt. Lawrence G. Evert, of Cody, Wyo., crashed in an F-105 jet on Nov. 8, 1967. Clinton is the third U.S. president to visit Vietnam. Lyndon B. Johnson went to Vietnam twice as president and Richard M. Nixon once, in 1969. --- On the Net: CIA World Factbook http://www.odci.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/vm.html

The two men who were carried out the suicide bombing of the USS Cole last month have been identified as veterans of the U.S.-backed guerrilla war to drive Soviet forces from Afghanistan, The Washington Post reported Friday. The newspaper quoted Yemen Prime Minister Abdul-Karim al-Iryani as saying in an interview that one of the men who steered the small boat of plastic explosives into the ship was a Yemeni born in the eastern province of Hadramaut. He would not discuss other details learned in the investigation of attack that killed 17 U.S. sailors Oct. 12 as the ship refueled in a port in Yemen. But he told the newspaper that authorities have solid leads to the identity of the second man, also thought to have been a native of Yemen. Al-Iryani said the identity of the first man was established by false identification discovered in one of the rented houses around Aden, where the attack was planned. The name on the ID forms, which included a boating license, was false, but the photo was genuine. The prime minister also told the Post that Yemeni investigators have learned a lot from relatives of the man. ``The picture inside the country should be very clear very soon. The question is outside. Who was involved outside the country?'' he said. Investigators have focused on Muslim extremists angered by the U.S. military presence in the Arabian Peninsula, especially Saudi Arabia. U.S. investigators have said the attack bears the earmarks of followers of Osama bin Laden, the exiled Saudi millionaire and Afghanistan veteran who officials say ordered the 1998 bombing of U.S. embassies in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. The prime minister said Yemeni investigators have not linked the Aden bombing to bin Laden, who has Yemeni citizenship by his father's birth in the Hadramaut region. But al-Iryani said a wider conspiracy seems obvious to Yemeni officials, who believe the Cole attack displayed technological savvy unknown in their country.

For years, Russians have complained about politicians who pepper their speech with puzzling terms derived from English or Latin, words like ``keeler,'' ``defolt,'' and ``impeech'' _ or ``killer,'' ``default'' and ``impeach,'' as they're better known to native speakers. Others bemoan the gangster-style talk of Russians, from the working classes to public figures, who litter their language with unprintable swear words. Now a group of lawmakers in Russia's parliament wants to outlaw both kinds of talk: The 12 legislators have proposed a bill that would mandate the use of Russian words instead of imports and make the use of swear words in any public comments a criminal offense. It is unclear how wide-ranging the bill would be, and whether it would apply to everyone or just politicians and the media. But under the bill, politicians talking about defaulting on debts would have to say ``nevypolneniye obyazatelstv'' instead of taking the common foreign shortcut, ``defolt.'' And references to the new ``millennium'' would be replaced by the Russian word, ``tysyacheletiye.'' The text of the draft has not been published yet, but excerpts were provided to The Associated Press by one of authors, pro-Kremlin Unity Party lawmaker Alexei Alexeyev. ``Unfortunately, there are no legal norms in our current legislation on the purity of the Russian language'' _ an oversight that the bill proposes to fix, Alexeyev said Thursday. The legislation was proposed by Unity but also backed by several of parliament's Communists, who are known for a nationalist dislike of imports, linguistic or otherwise. The bill may have a hard time winning wide backing in the house, called the State Duma, where many lawmakers themselves resort to foreign or unprintable words in private, and occasionally public, conversation. But the proposal highlights some Russians' growing concern about the state of the language of Tolstoy and Dostoyevsky. And it comes amid increasing threats to the language's eminence in former Soviet republics outside Russia, where long-suppressed local tongues are taking over. Almost daily, Russian newscasts show politicians talking about reaching ``konsensus'' (instead of ``soglasiye,'' the Russian word for ``agreement''); about the Communists' ``impichment'' attempt against ex-President Boris Yeltsin; about the government's ``defolt'' on foreign loans _ all words that were once alien to the Russian ear but recently have pushed their way into everyday conversation. Even the Russian word for ``murderer'' is often abandoned in favor of the English-derived ``killer,'' pronounced ``keeler.'' Many prominent government and public figures are notorious for mangling Russian's complex grammar. President Vladimir Putin himself could become a target of the bill: He is known to resort to rough speech at times, and at least once crossed publicly into the unprintable. Speaking to families of the sailors killed in the sinking of the submarine Kursk, he used an obscenity that prompted him to add: ``May the women forgive me.'' The lawmakers' effort is not the first crusade for the Russian language. A popular Russian radio station runs a brief program that highlights frequently mispronounced Russian words and tells listeners how to say them correctly. The Academy of Science's Institute of the Russian Language has set up a free telephone service for callers who want to know how to spell or use a difficult word. And the Russian Press Ministry has set up a literacy Web site with dictionaries and a survey of common language mistakes in the Russian media. ``Language is not simply a communication tool, but a creative force that forms, preserves and modifies the national perception of the world,'' the site says. Regulating the ``national perception of the world'' was something Soviet-era propaganda once excelled in. But in today's Russia, where state control over everything from speech to public dress is largely a thing of the past, the lawmakers' proposal has been received with humor rather than apprehension. Punishment for violators of the proposed language law has not been specified yet, Alexeyev said. He said the authors are still putting finishing touches on the document.

presiden clinton was making history today, very far from the tumult in which his successor will be chosen. mr. clinton, as we've said before, is the first president to go to vietnam since the war ded. it is a hugely symbolic visit to a nation which humiliated this one. any american who has any association with vietnam could not but be moved in some way. abc's john cochran is with him. it was a moment americans who fought in vietnam could never have imagined. a band playing "the star spangled banner," and playing it well. it was a remarkable day for the vietnamese as well. imagine, an american president in hanoi. they came, even though the communist government did nothing to organize enthusiastic crowds, as it usually does with foreign dignitaries. they came, not because they were ordered to, but becausec they agreed with the president finally, america is coming to see vietnam as your people have asked for years, as a country, not a war. authorities were clearly ambivalent about his visit. when the president urged more progress on human rights, vietnamese officials changed the subject. still, for the first time, they permit aid foreign leader to address their nation on television. open your socty and strengthen the rule of law. many vietnamese who watched were disappointed, not by what he said, but by what he did not say. this man, a veteran, joined many others who said the president should have apologized for the war. american officials say an apology would have been an affront to the americans who died in vietnam d the veterans o survived. in fact, president clinton gave american veterans the credit for leading the way to normal relations. after the war, they were among the first americans to come here urging better relations. the turning point came when the vietnamese agreed to help recover the remains of hundreds of missing americans. today, the president said cooperation must work both ways, and gave the vietnamese american military records to help locate their missing. 300,000 vietnam a# abc % h@ abc wo unaccounted for. john cochran, abc news, hanoi.

Meanwhile, the sitting President Bill Clinton continues his historic visit to Vietnam today, the first by a sitting President since the war. Although he stopped far short of apologizing for the Vietnam war, Mr. Clinton has promised a new era in relations between the old enemies. The World's Odolon Cussin reports on that story from Hanoi. After a long morning of meetings with Vietnam's President and visits to some of Hanoi's historic sites, Bill Clinton did what he seems to do best, he spoke to the people. In a rare gesture, President Clinton's address to students at Hanoi's National University was broadcast live to the whole country. I am honored to be the first American President to see Hanoi and to visit this University. I do so conscious that the histories of our two nations are deeply intertwined, in ways that are both a source of pain for generations that came before and a source of promise for generations yet to come. Though he mentioned the past and the scars caused by the war that ended 25 years ago, President Clinton mostly talked about the future. He repeated the now familiar call for globalization, developing the Internet and the promise of the so-called knowledge economy. Clinton's entourage includes several cabinet members, Senators and members of Congress. US trade representative Shirley Bershevsky today sang the praises of the US Vietnam bilateral trade deal, signed this summer and still awaiting approval by Congress. Massachusetts's Senator John Carey, a decorated Vietnam veteran, also accompanied the President. He said the cooperation of the Vietnamese government in recovering the remains of American soldiers still missing was a crucial factor in improving US Vietnam relations during the Clinton administration. It is a critical point, I mean it still remains a centerpiece of the cooperation that brings a stronger relationship. If we weren't able to cooperate on that, it will be a lot harder to cooperate on other things. Some American's accuse Clinton of working with a repressive government in Vietnam. National Security advisor Sandy Berger, who's travelling with the President, says the dialogue between Washington and Hanoi hasn't compromised American interests in any way. Today comminutes an effort that has been underway for eight years to rebuild our relationship with Vietnam, to normalize our relationship but to do so in a way that is true to our values and with total fidelity to those who served here and particularly the families of those people in Vietnam who are unaccounted for and missing. In today's televised speech, President Clinton indirectly criticized the Vietnamese government's restrictions on religion, the press and political dissent by holding up the United States as an example. In our experience, guaranteeing the right to religious worship and the right to political dissent does not threaten the stability of a society, instead it builds people's confidence in the fairness of our institutions. Emphatically denying that the United States was trying to impose its' vision of progress on Vietnam, President Clinton appealed to the generation of post war Vietnamese, who now make up more than half the country, to work toward a freer more open society. Only you can decide if you will continue to open your markets, open your society and strengthen the rule of law. Only you can decide how to weave individual liberties and human rights into the rich and strong fabric of Vietnamese national identity. Your future should be in your hands, the hands of the Vietnam's people. After the speech, thousands of people waited outside and lined the road leading from the University. This 22-year-old student said she didn't care what Mr. Clinton said about human rights, as long as increased US investment brought more jobs for people like her. I just care about the business and economy and I don't care about politics. I hope that President Clinton's visit to Vietnam will provide an opportunity for entrepreneurs in Vietnam to come to contact with American entrepreneurs and more jobs will be created. But whatever people in Vietnam think, critics back in the United States will have some more ammunition today, even though the State department shows the interpreter when his speech was broadcast on Vietnamese television, Clinton's rather mild mention of political dissent and religious freedoms was somehow lost in the translation. For The World this is Odolon Cussin in Hanoi. In the Vietnam war, approximately 58,000 Americans died, while 3 million Vietnamese perished. One of those statistics was a reporter for a Vietnamese newspaper, who died covering the conflict. Her daughter Huang Li has followed in her mother's footsteps and now works as a journalist at the BBC World Service in London. She's been measuring President Clinton's speeches about reconciliation against her own experience, as she reconciles her memories of the war with her life now working in the west. Li, thank you very much for joining us. Obviously your emotions are very complicated on a day like today. I wonder if you could sort them out a little bit for us? Yes, I mean I have felt so emotional these days and a bit complicated as you can see. On one hand you know I was excited about the visit of Mr. Clinton, the first US president to Vietnam since the war. But at the same time, his visit brings me back to the hardship that I used to have during the Vietnam war. I was in Hanoi during the heaviest air-strike by the Air Force of the United States. I was with my grandmom because my parents, they all were correspondents and I was too little to understand at that time about death and life. But, oh, I remember so vividly in my life that, you know, through the night we had to hide ourselves in a shelter, very tiny one, and through the night my grandmother, she was sitting outside of the shelter just because you know no more space for her. And I don't know all I remember, I was so worried about maybe my grandmom would die and that's why you know when Mr. Clinton visits the country, I have mixed emotions. But on the other hand you know, I am glad that now the relationship between two country is getting better and better. You became a journalist as your mother was. Is that partly why you chose the career that you did? I think I would like to follow my mother's and my father's footsteps, and that's why I have chosen to be a journalist. My dad wasn't happy at all, he thought that for a female being a journalist really, really difficult. I told him that why, you know I like that job. I wonder about another difference, I am thinking about the job that your mother might have been doing as a journalist in Vietnam, as a North Vietnamese journalist during the war. To some extent she must have been under certain pressures to report a story a certain way, certainly a way that the North Vietnamese government would approve. Here you are a journalist in a different generation and a different era. Do you see a big difference between the job that you are doing, and the job that maybe your mother did and died doing? Of course, you know I did see a big difference and that's when I have great empathy to my mom's job. I mean she was print journalist for the Northern government during the war and you know she left a diary, she wrote during her days of the war. She couldn't report what she saw because, you know, if propaganda, because you know if you report something like negative, maybe Vietnamese people can think that, oh we're losing the war and she could only report about heroes of the war. But during her real diary, I have seen many, many things that she was suffering, like you know even hunger and even the discussions between the soldiers and you know they kill each other by mistakes. If you were able to talk to her now and tell her what has happened since she died and what has happened as a result of the war in whose service, like 3 million Vietnamese, she died. What would you tell her? Actually I have never thought of this question, but if I would have had a chance to talk to her now I would say that, you know, now what she invested in her life and in her job, now you know it brings some positive result I think so for her own daughter and for the other people. You know I miss her very much and I wish she could be here with me working in a much, much freer environment. The war is still very alive for you as an emotional experience and has very vivid memories, and you are still a young person. Yet there are many people in Vietnam who are younger still, who weren't even born during what we call the Vietnam war and your countrymen call the American war. I wonder if you could speak a little bit about those people, for them who have had no direct experience, the majority in fact of the population of your country. Is the war the same ongoing issue? No, I don't think so. Actually for the young generation of Vietnam today you know, for them now it's only the future in front of them and they think 'Oh America is the land full of opportunities, of technology.' And they even don't want to talk about the war, so they have a completely different experience from what I am having. But however, I am very glad to see that, you know, people now they don't have to think of the war. And they, you know, when people ask them where do you want to go after your University, or where do you want to go to develop your career, I think one of the countries they would include in their answer is the United States. Huang Li is a producer with the BBC World Service and the daughter of one of the 3 million Vietnamese who died during the Vietnam war. President Clinton's visit to Vietnam is also bringing up memories of the conflict on this side of the Pacific, especially among American prisoners of war, many of whom remember their years in the infamous Hwa Lo prison. American POW's nicknamed Hwa Lo the Hanoi Hilton, and its prisoners included Senator John McCain and current US ambassador to Vietnam, P. Peterson. They and dozen of others, remember all too well the 5 by 9 concrete cells, the sound of tapping on the walls at night, the leg irons. Others recall standing before firing squads that shot blanks and being forced to kneel on concrete floors for days. It was a very, very awful situation said Ambassador Peterson earlier this week, one full of bad memories for the prisoner survivors. At a dinner at Hanoi today, President Clinton told his hosts that the US and Vietnam had buried the bitterness and are building a new history. Part of that new history is a new Hanoi Hilton. Just down the block from the old Hwa Lo prison which has been turned into a museum stands the brand new 269 room 62 million-dollar Hilton Hotel. Hilton International owns a 40% stake in the new venture, with a French Vietnamese company splitting the remaining 60%. Guests of the old Hanoi Hilton may note with some irony that the White House is using the new hotel as its media center, during President Clinton's visit.

President Clinton continues his landmark trip to Vietnam today with a visit to Ho Chi Minh City, known as Saigon when it was the capital of US-backed South Vietnam. The associated press says residents of the city renamed after the communist takeover in 1975, were showered on the eve of the Clinton visit with pro-democracy pamphlets dropped by air. They were apparently delivered by a one-time South Vietnamese Air Force pilot who managed to buzz the city undetected in a small plane. Earlier, in a speech to Vietnamese students, President Clinton thanked the Vietnamese for helping to find the remains of Americans missing in action from the war. No two nations have ever before done the things we are doing together to find the missing from the Vietnam conflict. Teams of Americans and Vietnamese work together, sometimes in tight and dangerous places. The Vietnamese government has offered us access to files and government information to assist our search. And in turn, we have been able to give Vietnam almost 400,000 pages of documents that could assist in your search.

On Thursday, President Clinton began a three-day visit to Vietnam. VOA's David Gallust accompanied the President to cover the story. However, Vietnam did not permit two reporters for US funded Radio Free Asia to enter the country. In fact, France Press said journalists were not allowed to get off their plane until 90 minutes after it landed, as Vietnamese authorities looked for the two RFA reporters. US Ambassador to Vietnam, P.J. Crowley, lodged a protest over this affair. RFA, like VOA, has a Vietnamese service. The situation parallels one in 1998 when China would not allow RFA reporters to accompany President Clinton during his visit to that country.

A British engineer was killed and his wife was injured on Friday when their car blew up on a busy commercial street in the heart of the Saudi capital. The explosion, apparently caused by a bomb or other device inside the four-wheel-drive vehicle, shattered the tense calm that has prevailed in the Persian Gulf since a terrorist attack on a U.S. warship last month outside the port of Aden, in neighboring Yemen. A senior Saudi official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the deadly blast would be investigated as a possible terrorist attack aimed at Westerners in the capital. The Saudi police indicated that they were already treating the incident as a criminal matter. In a statement to the official Saudi Press Agency, Riyadh's police chief, Abdullah al-Shahrani, said ``an explosive charge'' inside the British couple's car may have been responsible for the explosion that ripped through the driver's side at 1:23 p.m. The blast occurred during a heavy rainstorm, just off a main highway that runs east and west through the center of the capital and is lined with high-rise shopping centers and strip malls. It followed midday prayers, when shops are generally closed, on the last day of the Saudi weekend, and did not cause any apparent damage to nearby buildings. Europeans, Americans and many other non-Saudis are immediately identifiable here because they dress differently. Saudi men stand out because they wear long white robes and headdresses. Saudi women are required to cover themselves in public with billowing black cloaks and wear a veil that leaves only their eyes visible. Non-Muslim women, while they must wear long shapeless coats in public, are not obliged to wear veils. The British Foreign Office identified the couple in the car as Christopher Rodway, an engineer at a Riyadh hospital, and his wife, Jane, both in their 40s. They had lived in Saudi Arabia for about eight years, and neither worked at the British Embassy, according to Ian Wilson, the British consul in Riyadh. He said Mrs. Rodway had been treated for her injuries in a Riyadh hospital and released. Her husband, who was driving, died of his injuries in the hospital about six hours after the blast. Anti-American sentiment has been growing in the region in tandem with the spiraling Palestinian-Israeli violence of the last seven weeks. As Palestinian casualties have mounted _ and dozens of those injured have been brought, with great fanfare, to countries like Saudi Arabia for treatment _ many Arabs have accused the United States of defending Israel. Britain has also been accused of being pro-Israel, but to a much lesser extent than the United States. Still, a bomb was thrown at the British Embassy in Sana, the Yemeni capital, last month, two weeks after a terrorist bomb ripped through the hull of the destroyer Cole as it was refueling in Aden. Seventeen U.S. sailors were killed in the Aden harbor attack. U.S. and Yemeni investigators have said they suspect that those responsible were Islamic militants opposed to the presence of U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia and other Persian Gulf states. Since the Aden bombing, U.S. forces in the area have been on heightened security alert. The car explosion occurred just a few hours before Crown Prince Abdullah formally opened an international meeting here of ministers and oil industry officials from more than 40 oil-producing and oil-consuming countries. Among those attending the energy forum, which is taking place in a luxury hotel about two miles from the scene of the blast, was Energy Secretary Bill Richardson, who arrived in the capital after the incident. Another U.S. official, Defense Secretary William S. Cohen, is expected to visit Saudi Arabia sometime in the next few days as part of a tour of the Persian Gulf. The timing of Cohen's arrivals in various gulf countries is being kept secret, according to the Pentagon. Saudi Arabia, the world's biggest oil exporter, has long been a close ally of the United States, which used it as the staging ground for the allied offensive against Iraq in 1991. Although public protests are not permitted in the insular kingdom, hostility to the continuing U.S. military presence here has occasionally burst into the open. In 1995, a car bomb outside the U.S. military headquarters in Riyadh killed five Americans. A year later, in the eastern city of Dhahran, 19 U.S. servicemen were killed when a truck bomb exploded outside a military housing complex.

A British hospital worker died Friday when an explosion tore through his car while he was driving with his wife through the rainy, quiet streets of the Saudi capital. The blast killed Christopher Rodway, the British Foreign Office said. His wife, Jane Rodway, was slightly injured and released from the hospital hours after the explosion. Britain's Press Association said both victims were in their 40s and had lived in Saudi Arabia for eight years. The couple's car may have been booby-trapped, according to a statement from Riyadh Police Chief Abdullah al-Shahrani. Earlier Saudi sources had said an explosive device was thrown into the vehicle from the outside. Traffic was fairly light in the central Riyadh commercial district when the explosion blew through the couple's four-wheel-drive vehicle at 1:23 p.m. The blast was not powerful enough to break the windows of the adjacent Five Star Barber Shop or any nearby shops. Most businesses in the area, including a supermarket and pharmacy down the street, were closed for the Muslim holy day. The victims were rushed to the hospital, and police cordoned off the thoroughfare. Within hours, the Rodways' vehicle and other evidence of the explosion had been removed, and the remaining blood on the street had been washed away by the rain. Traffic soon resumed as normal. One witness said the man's leg was nearly severed when rescue workers removed him from the vehicle. The explosion came just hours before the start of an international energy conference meant to discuss ways of ensuring stability in world oil markets. Officials from oil-producing countries, the European Union, the World Bank and other international organizations are in Riyadh for the three-day meeting. U.S. forces in Saudi Arabia and other parts of the Gulf have been on the highest alert level since an Oct. 12 attack on the USS Cole killed 17 American sailors in the port of Aden, Yemen. Such an alert level is only issued when an attack occurs in the region or when there is specific information indicating that one may occur. American residents in Saudi Arabia had been reminded of the alert, with the U.S. Embassy describing it as a ``precautionary measure.'' U.S. investigators have said the attack on the Cole bears the earmarks of followers of Osama bin Laden, the exiled Saudi millionaire who officials say ordered the deadly 1998 bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. Bin Laden is hiding in Afghanistan as the guest of its Islamic rulers, the Taliban.

HANOI, Vietnam _ ``Master Lien! Master Lien!'' came the tiny voice over a distant telephone line, ``Please give me directions. It's so hard to find.'' Nguyen Van Lien, a glass of cold tea in his hand, replied without a pause. ``Just go down to the southwest about 200 meters, and you'll find a small road,'' he said. ``You see a hill with a lot of rocks on it? That's where he's buried.'' With a little whack he turned off the speaker phone and returned to the map he was drawing on his desk: blue rivers, yellow roads, red landmarks, black grave sites. ``It's like a screen in front of my eyes, like a movie screen,'' he said. ``I can see 1,000 kilometers away. When they call me on the phone I can see them.'' Lien, 38, is a psychic, offering a last resort to desperate Vietnamese whose relatives are still missing, 25, 30, 35 years after they died fighting against the United States. Nobody knows just how many Vietnamese soldiers are unaccounted for; the most common estimate is 300,000. ``Better than the American methods, isn't it?'' Lien said. ``I just sit here in my room, and I never need to go out.'' As he spoke Saturday morning, President Clinton was touring an excavation site near Hanoi where a search team was sifting through the dirt for the remains of American servicemen missing from the war. The dig was part of a major operation coordinated in Hawaii that includes a permanent office here and periodic search operations that can deploy well over 100 American military personnel. About 1,500 Americans are missing from the war, a tiny fraction of the number of missing Vietnamese. But while the Vietnamese government has set up a well-run office to assist the United States in its search, it has no organized program to try to find its own missing soldiers. On his visit here, Clinton has promised to share more than a million American military documents _ in addition to hundreds of thousands already provided _ to help Vietnam locate its missing. But for the moment, the Vietnamese have no mechanism to collate the mounds of material. Instead, families pool their resources for free-lance expeditions, sometimes with the assistance of veterans' associations and the logistical help of local military units. And still, decades after the war ended, they send photographs and documents to a television station that regularly broadcasts information about the missing in the hope that someone will remember. ``The searches are still going on here in Vietnam, and the pain of the fathers and the mothers, I guess, is just the same as the pain of the American families,'' said Nguyen Ngoc Hung, 51, a veteran who lost a brother in the war. ``You know, the Vietnamese honor the dead, and they would like to bring them home to bury in the village cemetery so that later generations can come and worship, rather than leaving them in the jungle,'' he said. The psychic searches are frowned on by the government, but they work, said Hung, who has a master's degree in foreign languages and runs an English-language institute. ``My family went to a psychic, and she directed us to the place where my brother was buried,'' he said. ``She summoned up his spirit and talked to him. My whole family _ my son, my younger brother, my father _ went to the site and dug up my brother and brought him back. Now, he is buried in a veterans' cemetery in Hanoi, and so we can go and pray at his grave.'' As with the families of recovered American servicemen, the discovery and reburial lifted a burden from the hearts of his parents. ``I guess they will live 10 years longer now,'' Hung said. A dozen people crowded into the small, spare office of the psychic, Lien, Saturday morning, as a portrait of Vietnam's communist hero, Ho Chi Minh, smiled and waved down at them from the wall. They stared at Lien in a silence broken by the ticking of an electric clock as he quickly sketched a map, sitting cross-legged on a swivel chair at a little metal desk. ``What are all those green things?'' asked Nguyen Duc Hai, 29, a military officer, who would use this map to seek his uncle, who died in 1969. ``They're mountains,'' said Lien. ``This is northern Laos.'' Without any apparent consultation with the spirits, Lien told the story of Hai's uncle, as if chatting about a friend. ``This is not your first uncle, but your second uncle,'' he said, correctly. ``He joined the army before 1970, and he died about 1971. He never married. He had an argument with his girlfriend, and that's why he signed up. He became a scout searching for forward positions and was assigned to Base 42 in Xiang-khouang Province; that's in Laos. Eight men went out on his last mission. Only two returned.'' As far as Hai could tell, the psychic got most of it right, and he was impressed. ``Oh, yes, master,'' he said from time to time. The master's narrative was interrupted frequently by more telephone calls from people who were already out in the countryside attempting to follow his directions. ``Who's there? Speak up!'' he demanded each time, slapping at the button on his speaker phone. ``It's Khoan,'' said one caller. ``I'm so tired.'' Lien was gentle. ``Just take a rest for a while,'' he said, ``and you'll feel better.'' He had less patience with another caller who couldn't seem to find his way. ``Where are you going?'' he said. ``Does it look like the map I drew you? You have to go on past the village and ask the farmers to point you to the coffee grove.'' As he filled in the colors of his map, Lien gave directions to Hai, speaking quickly and sometimes unintelligibly. But he had a tape in a deck beside him that the young officer would take with him on his journey into the green mountains that were taking form on the map. ``It's a tough hike,'' the psychic said. ``You can't get in by car; even by horse it's difficult. Down here is Hill 308. And up here, you'll see some trenches. And the grave of your uncle is right at the beginning of the Cut Stream.'' Standing outside afterward, holding his map and his audio tape, Hai said he had paid the equivalent of $3.50 for the seance and for the right to telephone in from his expedition for more directions. It would be his family's second search attempt, after an earlier failed trek into the mountains of Laos, where tens of thousands of soldiers died along the old Ho Chi Minh trail. Asked if the government had done anything to help search for his uncle, Hai answered in English, ``No. No.'' Then he added, ``We have to manage on our own, with our own money.'' Asked how he felt about the contrast between the searches for Americans and Vietnamese lost in the war, he paused a long moment before answering. ``Vietnam is a very poor country,'' he said. ``There is only so much our government can do. We expect in the future that our government will have better programs for people looking for lost soldiers.''

The last transmission anyone heard from Lt. Col. Lawrence G. Evert's F-105D Thunderbird was only three words long: ``I'm hit hard.'' Moments later, an American flier on a bombing run over this small village saw what he thought was the explosion of an aircraft hitting the rice paddies. That was 33 years and 10 days ago. It took until this year for U.S. investigators to narrow the search for Evert's plane to a site just outside this impoverished village 17 miles northwest of Hanoi, the capital, and to win approval to dig it up. And then, in the weeks just before President Clinton's arrival here on Thursday, the soft, acidic earth of Tien Chau began giving up bits of wiring, bolts and plastic, clearly from an aircraft, and finally what forensic experts believe are small amounts of human remains. They have not yet been identified. Nonetheless, in one of the most emotional moments of his presidency, Clinton drove on Saturday into the Vietnamese countryside, past water buffalo and a Japanese motorcycle factory and farmers tending their flooded fields, to find the site. He hiked along a bamboo boardwalk to the place where some older villagers still remember seeing a plume of smoke after an American fighter was shot down by anti-aircraft fire. And he brought with him the downed pilot's two sons, who spent Friday sifting the mud through fine mesh, searching for the father they last saw when he flew out of Phoenix on a hot summer day in 1967. ``When we were 6 and 8 years old,'' David Evert said Saturday, choking back tears as he gestured toward his older brother, Dan, ``we'd talk about how we would come to Vietnam and rescue him. We kind of feel that we're doing that now.'' Clinton's trip across the pocked dirt roads of this poverty-stricken section of Vietnam was intended as a vivid demonstration of how a new era has arrived, one in which Americans and Vietnamese work together, six days a week, finishing the muddy and emotionally draining business of accounting for 1,498 Americans still listed as missing in action here. Standing in mud-covered work shoes, Clinton on Saturday called the joint search for remains a coming together of former enemies that was ``unprecedented in human history.'' But like most of Clinton's trip here, the somber trek into the paddies was a reminder that piecing together the United States' relations with Vietnam is as slow and agonizing a process as looking for the remnants of Lawrence Evert's fighter. ``Look, neither side is ever going to fully get past it,'' said Pete Peterson, the former prisoner of war who now serves as U.S. ambassador here. ``Reminders of the war are everywhere. You drive by them every day. But we can't change the past and we can change the future, and bringing the president here to talk about what we can do together _ I think that opens a lot of minds here.'' It is far too early to tell what will come of Clinton's three-day journey to Vietnam. At almost midnight Saturday, he flew into the city once known as Saigon, the U.S. headquarters for prosecuting a failed war that Clinton himself opposed as a young man. Despite the late hour, thousands of people lined his route for the 15-minute drive from the airport, with many waving as he sped by. For all the enthusiasm that his arrival has generated among young people _ 60 percent of Vietnamese were born after 1970 _ the Communist government in Hanoi remains deeply suspicious of U.S. intentions. Engagement sounds fine, they all say, as long as it does not loosen the party's control of the country, or cause the kind of economic upheavals that have leveled so many authoritarian regimes. Indeed, Vietnam's Communist Party chief, Le Kha Phieu, spoke the language of ``old socialism'' in a meeting with Clinton on Saturday evening, and did not respond when the president suggested that the country would benefit from more political freedoms, a senior U.S. official said. ``It was the more traditional side of Vietnamese politics,'' the official said. ``He did talk about openness. He did talk about private entrepreneurship, but more clearly in the context of what you would have heard here 10 years ago or 15 years ago.'' After Clinton completed his official meetings here Saturday, one senior administration official said, ``They know they won the war, but they are wondering what went wrong with the peace.'' One kind of engagement seems fine to the Hanoi authorities: the kind that is happening out here in the rice paddies of Tien Chau. It is, without question, a remarkable sight, one also on view at five other places around the country where the Vietnamese are digging for the remains of missing Americans. Scores of villagers have signed up for jobs slicing away at the mud beneath the recently drained paddy, using a jerry-rigged device called a cheese cutter. They have a lot of cutting ahead of them: Evert's plane is believed to have tunneled a hole at least 16 feet deep. With hardly a word passing among them, the workers put mud in buckets and pass it along by hand to a wooden platform where dozens of young Vietnamese women in purple raincoats sift through it, looking for anything that resembles bones or manufactured parts. Hundreds have been found, but few are larger than the size of a thumb. From the site, where they are ankle-deep in muddy water, the workers can just make out a long metal railroad bridge that U.S. forces were trying to destroy that night. Evert's plane was the fourth and last in a formation, and no one knows if he dropped his ordnance. But they know he never pulled up to head south, and no one saw him eject or noticed a parachute open. A crew member on a nearby plane reported that the aircraft had been hit on the left rear fuselage by intense anti-aircraft fire, an image that seemed hard to imagine on Saturday on the peaceful paddies, where children were laughing and playing on the narrow dirt road and watching the man from America who arrived with roughly 40 cars, vans and buses. Just five days after the crash, Evert's fourth child, a daughter named Elizabeth, was born. His widow, Wanda, raised the four children alone. While nothing conclusive has been found, investigators seem quite certain that what they have tripped upon are the fractured remains of the F-105D. ``This is a chance for them to take their family home,'' Clinton said Saturday, after touring the site with his daughter, Chelsea, and his wife, Senator-elect Hillary Rodham Clinton, who said nothing in public. David Evert said Saturday that he had been surprised at the greeting he received from the local townspeople who came out to the site. They asked him about his other relatives, and wanted to know details of his father. ``They wanted to know how old we were when our father crashed,'' said Evert, now 39. ``It's amazing how hard they work, and how dedicated they are.'' It will be months, maybe years, before the Evert family knows for sure what has been dug up. DNA testing will have to be conducted on the tiny amount of remains, which will be sent to Hawaii. Plane parts will be studied for evidence that the aircraft is the one everyone thinks it is. ``We can wait,'' said David Evert, a television cameraman. ``We've waited 33 years not knowing much. What's a few more months?''

When President Clinton reached out to shake Hoan Quang Sy's hand, the 11-year-old boy responded with a traditional show of respect, extending both arms. But the left hand was missing, the result of a bomb from a war over long before his birth. Sy was among four young boys who met the president Saturday during an event highlighting efforts to clear an estimated 3 million land mines and 300,000 tons of unexploded ordnance scattered about Vietnam. The youths were maimed in the central province of Quang Tri, which straddled the Demilitarized Zone during the Vietnam War and was the site of fierce fighting. Clinton squeezed the boys' shoulders and first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton put her arm around the short, slightly stocky Sy as the couple viewed an exhibition of art by children injured by unexploded ordnance. One had suffered severe burns to his face that led to extensive treatment, including eight months at Boston's Shriners Hospital; more reconstructive surgery is possible. A second lost his left hand and right eye. His twin brother still has fragments in his body from the same explosion. Noting that unexploded leftovers of war still wound or kill about 2,000 Vietnamese a year, Clinton called land mines ``the curse of innocent children all over the world.'' He said the United States will help remove them in Vietnam and war zones in Africa and the Balkans. ``You will have America's support until you have found every land mine and every piece of unexploded ordnance,'' the president told a group that included five members of Congress. ``This is the tragedy of war for which peace produces no answer.'' Yet neither nation has signed the 139-country treaty outlawing land mines; the United States stockpiles an estimated 11 million of them and Vietnam is still listed as a producer. Washington says mines remain a necessary deterrent protecting South Korea from the North. Sy's father and uncle were collecting scrap metal five years ago when they found a bomb, according to Kristen Leadem of PeaceTrees Vietnam, a group helping to remove mines. When they used a hammer to try to extract the explosive, the bomb went off, seriously injuring Sy and killing his father on the spot. His mother was left with six children to raise. The Clintons saw an outdoor exhibit that included a variety of artificial limbs and wheelchairs, along with a large, rusting bomb and dug-up mines, mortars and grenades. The United States has provided more than $3 million since July to buy mine-removing equipment and survey the countryside. Clinton said Washington had spent $350 million in the past eight years for such efforts around the world. ``I think we should do more,'' he said. Vietnam said in a detailed report a year ago that 38,248 people had died from unexploded ordnance since the war between the communist North and U.S.-backed South ended April 30, 1975. Most deaths were attributed to that war; others occurred in the far north, site of a brief but bloody border war with China in 1979. Some 3 million unexploded devices were cleared in a 1975-77 campaign while another, from 1991 to 1998 in the North, found 2.3 million _ and left 37 soldiers dead. Clearing infested land is especially important in a nation where three-quarters of the population lives in the countryside farming small plots. ___ On the Net: PeaceTrees Vietnam site: http://www.PeaceTreesVietnam.org/default.htm International Campaign to Ban Landmines: http://www.icbl.org Land mine treaty: http://www.un.org/Depts/dpko/mine/UNDocs/ban_trty.htm

Facing political turmoil at home, President Alberto Fujimori plans to remain in Tokyo until Wednesday to negotiate loans to ease Peru's financial problems, the government gazette said Saturday. The reason for Fujimori's prolonged stay in Japan, explained in a resolution signed by Prime Minister Federico Salas, did little to help dispel rumors that the embattled president was in Asia seeking political asylum. ``I have the impression that he's in the process of writing his resignation,'' opposition Congressman Luis Solari told radio station Radioprogramas. The resolution, published in the government newspaper, El Peruano, authorized Second Vice President Ricardo Marquez to remain in charge during Fujimori's absence. However, the announcement contradicted a statement issued hours earlier by Japan's Foreign Ministry that said a cold was keeping Fujimori in Tokyo a while longer. Hisashi Ueno, of Japan's Central and South American Affairs Bureau, said it was not immediately clear when Fujimori planned to return home. He would not elaborate on Fujimori's condition. When Fujimori first arrived Friday, Ueno said he was in Japan only to change planes. Fujimori, who first came to power in 1990, was born to Japanese immigrant parents who picked cotton in Peru until they could open a tailor's shop in downtown Lima. The 62-year-old president has maintained strong ties to his ancestral homeland. His son, Hiro, lives in Japan, as do his sister and brother-in-law, Victor Aritomi, Peru's ambassador to the country. Ueno said Saturday that Fujimori had not asked for asylum, echoing similar denials from the Malaysian government and Fujimori's top aides. ``It's incomprehensible, this provocative and irresponsible attitude of the president,'' opposition Congressman Fernando Olivera told The Associated Press. ``Why isn't Fujimori able to pick up a phone and inform the Peruvian people what he's up to?'' Olivera said he plans to introduce a resolution this week that would lift Fujimori's blanket permission to travel abroad. Under Peru's constitution, Fujimori needs congressional approval to leave the country. But in the last eight years, his ruling bloc has all but waived the restriction, passing resolutions every three to six months allowing him to come and go at will. Fujimori announced two months ago that he would end his presidency in July after his now-fugitive ex-spy chief, Vladimiro Montesinos, became the focus of a corruption scandal. But some of his top ministers have suggested that he might not last until the April special elections. The authoritarian leader _ whose victory to a third five-year term in May was marred by irregularities and fraud allegations _ has seen his autocratic rule of Peru slip away in recent weeks. Opposition lawmakers took control of Congress on Thursday, for the first time since 1992, with the election of Valentin Paniagua to the post of Congress president. That has opened the possibility that Congress could try to remove Fujimori on grounds of ``moral incapacity'' _ as permitted by the constitution. Economy Minister Carlos Bolona expressed confidence Friday that Congress not attempt to oust Fujimori _ a move he said would ``generate uncertainty and chaos.'' Bolona said Fujimori was in Japan to raise $300 million to $500 million in loans to cover an anticipated $1 billion hole in Peru's 2001 budget. Fujimori stopped in Tokyo on his way home from a midweek summit of Pacific Rim nations in Brunei. He was widely criticized at home for leaving Peru to attend the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum summit. He canceled a planned trip to Panama this weekend for the Ibero-American summit of Spanish-speaking and Portuguese-speaking leaders.

President Clinton honored the search for U.S. forces missing in Vietnam, lamenting ``the anguish of not knowing'' their fate, then flew to this bustling city, known as Saigon before its surrender to communist forces in America's most humiliating military defeat. Clinton, after two days in Hanoi, arrived near midnight Saturday night. Despite the hour, thousands lined the route for his 15-minute drive from the airport, many waving, some cheering, as his motorcade swept by. On the final day of his groundbreaking Vietnam visit, Clinton was to meet John Baptist Pham Minh Man, archbishop of Ho Chi Minh City, thereby demonstrating support for the right to religious worship, White House officials said. Ahead of Clinton's appearances, police broke up a sit-in by more than 150 peasants who had camped out beneath protest banners for several months near a government office. The communist government's decision to allow the protest over land to go on for so long suggested a gradual loosening of official controls. But the peaceful overnight dispersal revealed the limits of what the regime will tolerate, as well as its sensitivity to international scrutiny during the U.S. president's visit. Leaving Hanoi, Clinton stood at attention on a floodlit tarmac as a U.S. military honor guard took possession of the remains of three missing Americans and sent them to Hawaii for identification. Much of Saturday was devoted to American MIAs and Vietnamese children maimed from leftover mines and bombs in the Vietnam War, subjects that weighed heavily on Clinton's emotions. The president visited a rice paddy outside Hanoi where recovery workers were digging through mud for any remains of Air Force fighter pilot Lawrence G. Evert, whose jet crashed on a bombing run in 1967. Evert's sons, David and Daniel from Chandler, Ariz., accompanied the president. ``When we were younger, about 6 and 8, we used to talk about how we would come over to Vietnam and come get him out of jail _ we thought he was alive so we thought we'd come get him and take him home and rescue him,'' said David, now 39. ``And we kind of feel like that's what we're doing right now.'' Tears welled in Clinton's eyes as he stood on a bamboo-supported platform beside the excavation pit. ``Whether we are American or Vietnamese,'' Clinton said, ``I think we all want to know where our loved ones are buried.'' Clinton is the first president in 31 years to visit Vietnam and the first ever to stop in Hanoi. In a farewell meeting with President Tran Duc Luong in Hanoi, he joked about the U.S. election stalemate: ``I have to go home to see if there's a president.'' Luong called Clinton's visit ``a new page'' in relations. ``It's a shame this is so short,'' Luong said. ``I hope the next U.S. president will continue what we have started.'' U.S. Ambassador Pete Peterson said the visit had improved understanding and trust between the two nations. After losing 58,000 Americans in Vietnam, the United States withdrew its combat forces in 1973. Two years later, on April 30, 1975, a rear guard of 11 Marines scrambled aboard a helicopter at the U.S. Embassy in a blaze of tear gas and smoke grenades. They fled Saigon as communist forces surged into the city and the U.S.-backed government announced an unconditional surrender. Saigon was renamed Ho Chi Minh City in honor of the revolutionary leader who declared Vietnam's independence from French rule in 1945 and led the struggle against the United States. In a striking gesture of reconciliation, Clinton went to the Communist Party headquarters in Hanoi and chatted amiably with party secretary Le Kha Phieu. He is head of an 18-member politburo that determines government policy. ``I hope you have enjoyed your stay,'' Phieu said. ``I'm very much enjoying my time here,'' Clinton replied. ``The people have been very kind.'' The president also attended a ceremony intended to raise consciousness about unexploded mines and bombs that still wound or kill 2,000 Vietnamese a year. Clinton called land mines ``the curse of innocent children all over the world.'' He said there are about 300,000 tons of unexploded ordnance and about 3.5 million land mines buried in Vietnam. ``You will have America's support until you have found every land mine and every piece of unexploded ordnance,'' the president said. ``This is the tragedy of war for which peace produces no answer.'' He met four children maimed by unexploded ordnance. Hoan Quang Sy, 11, extended both arms to Clinton in a traditional Asian greeting, but his left hand was gone, the result of an old bomb. Neither country has signed a 1977 treaty outlawing land mines, which the United States stockpiles and Vietnam produces. The United States says mines are needed in the Korean Peninsula until an effective alternative is found. At the Hanoi airport, the U.S. honor guard carried in turn three small wooden boxes of remains, each placed in an aluminum casket and covered by the American flag as the guard saluted and Clinton stood at attention beside Peterson. The remains were placed on a C-117 for transport to Hawaii. In all, 21 sets of remains from two wars _ the three sets from Vietnam, three from neighboring Laos and 15 from North Korea _ are being taken to Army forensics experts in Hawaii for identification, arriving Monday. Friday morning, Clinton's motorcade rode on a narrow dirt road to a village by a railroad bridge targeted by a squadron of four American warplanes on Nov. 8, 1967. One of the planes, piloted by Evert, was shot down. Vietnamese workers and American experts are searching for his remains in the thick clay, forcing it through a mesh sieve. ``This common endeavor we make as friends is unprecedented in all of human history,'' Clinton said. Evert was shot down five days before the birth of his fourth child, a daughter named Elizabeth. David recalled the last time he saw his dad, at the Phoenix airport. ``As he walked up the stairs to get on to the plane ... he turned and he waved to us.'' David Evert expressed his gratitude to the Vietnamese for helping recover the remains. ``It's very touching to see the Vietnamese people working to push the mud through, to find the little pieces,'' he said. ``We want them to know that we love them and we don't hold any animosity toward them at all. And we feel it's a time for healing for everybody.'' The Vietnamese count about 300,000 of their people still missing. The United States lists 1,498 Americans missing in Vietnam, 421 in Laos and 65 in Cambodia. ``The United States is doing ... all we can to help the people of Vietnam find answers about their missing, as well,'' Clinton said. He expressed gratitude to the Army's Central Identification Laboratory in Hawaii and those ``who help to end the anguish of not knowing.'' ``Our nation has made a commitment that we will not rest until we've achieved the fullest possible accounting for our lost veterans,'' the president said. ___ On the Web: CIA World Factbook: http://www.odci.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/vm.html

President Alberto Fujimori, dragged down by corruption scandals, will resign Monday or Tuesday, Prime Minister Federico Salas said Sunday. ``President Alberto Fujimori will present his resignation ... to Congress on Monday or Tuesday at the latest,'' Salas announced over Radioprogramas, Peru's major news radio station. He said he had just been in contact with Fujimori, who is in Japan, and that the president would give his explanation when he resigns. ``What I know is that he does not want to be an obstacle to the process of democratization so that the next elections can be elections absolutely transparent for the Peruvian people,'' Salas said. The announcement came amid a growing corruption scandal revolving around Fujimori's fugitive ex-intelligence chief, Vladimiro Montesinos. It was Montesinos' appearance in a leaked video apparently bribing an opposition congressman that forced Fujimori's decision in September to step down next July after new elections _ ending a decade of iron-fisted rule. Normally under the constitution, First Vice President Francisco Tudela would assume the presidency. But Tudela presented his resignation hours after Montesinos returned to Peru on Oct. 23 after a failed asylum bid in Panama. Tudela complained that Fujimori was not in control of Montesinos and his allies. Second Vice President Ricardo Marquez said last week that he, too, would resign if Congress took measures to remove Fujimori. On Thursday, opposition lawmakers took control of Congress for the first time since 1992 with the election of Valentin Paniagua to the post of Congress president _ opening the way for lawmakers to remove Fujimori on grounds of ``moral incapacity'' _ as permitted by the Constitution. That would open the way for Paniagua, a political moderate, to assume the presidency until new elections are held April 8. Paniagua is the next in line for the presidency after the second vice president. Fujimori was widely criticized at home for leaving Peru to attend the Nov. 15-16 Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum summit. He then made an unannounced detour to Japan, canceling a planned trip to Panama this weekend where Spanish-speaking and Portuguese-speaking leaders held an Ibero-American summit. Then on Saturday, the government announced that Fujimori planned to remain in Tokyo until Wednesday to negotiate loans to ease Peru's financial problems. The reason for Fujimori's prolonged stay in Japan prompted speculation that Fujimori was planning to quit the presidency and possibly stay in his ancestral homeland. When the president arrived in Japan on Friday, Hisashi Ueno, of Japan's Central and South American Affairs Bureau, said he was in the country only for a layover to change planes. On Saturday, Japan's Foreign Ministry that said Fujimori would stay in Tokyo longer than planned because he has a cold. The same day, Ueno said that Fujimori had not asked for asylum, echoing similar denials from the Malaysian government and Fujimori's top aides. Fujimori has led an unsuccessful manhunt for Montesinos, who is wanted for alleged money-laundering after Swiss authorities froze $48 million in accounts linked to the former spymaster. The amount under investigation swelled to $58 million after other accounts were discovered in the Cayman Islands, Uruguay and New York, authorities said. Despite Montesinos' dark reputation, Fujimori for years had defended their close relationship, insisting that Montesinos proved highly effective in helping to defeat leftist rebels and undercut narcotics trafficking. Montesinos faces criminal complaints in Peru ranging from money laundering and directing state-sponsored death squads and torture to skimming profits from narcotics trades during his 10 years as Fujimori's top aide. Fujimori, who first came to power in 1990, was born to Japanese immigrant parents who picked cotton in Peru until they opened a tailor's shop in downtown Lima. The 62-year-old president has maintained strong ties to Japan. His son, Hiro, lives there, as do his sister and brother-in-law, Victor Aritomi, Peru's ambassador to the country.

Concluding a historic visit, President Clinton urged this communist nation Sunday to open its economy and allow greater individual freedoms, saying the rewards of a free-market system ``should be embraced, not feared.'' The first U.S. president to visit since the Vietnam War, Clinton declared, ``The years of animosity are past. Today we have a shared interest in your well-being and your prosperity. We have a stake in your future and we wish to be your partners. We wish you success.'' After a two-day visit to Hanoi where he nurtured long-bitter U.S.-Vietnam relations and got the Communist Party's upbeat view of post-war Vietnam from the party's top leader, Clinton arrived in the city once known as Saigon to cheers of thousands of people who lined the streets late at night. In the final hours of the president's visit to the country, Clinton stopped at a shipping dock on the Saigon River. Under the shadow of two giant cranes, he spoke at a container terminal that is a joint venture between a Vietnamese state-owned company and a multinational firm. Clinton said Vietnam's own government acknowledges that state-owned enterprises cannot create enough jobs for Vietnam, one of the poorest countries in the world with an average annual income of $372. ``But Vietnam's young people have the talent and ideas to create the jobs of the future for themselves in a new era of entrepreneurship, innovation and competition. ``That must be the future for Vietnam and its young people,'' the president told an audience of about 2,000 people in the midday heat. The United States and Vietnam signed a sweeping trade agreement this year that will force major economic reforms and allow generally unfettered commerce. Clinton said it would bring more investors here. ``Both our nations should ratify this agreement and implement it. The changes it will bring should be embraced, not feared,'' he said. Clinton promised that the United States would establish a $200 million line of credit to support U.S. investment in Vietnam. Earlier, Clinton plunged into crowds in a narrow shopping street, shaking hands and stopping at open-front markets to buy last-minute gifts. To a generation of American GIs, this bustling city of 5 million people was known as Saigon before its surrender to communist forces in America's most humiliating military defeat. The president sat in a courtyard of the city's fine arts museum to discuss Vietnam's future with young people in business, academia, the arts and the media. He extolled the virtues of freedom and opportunity and the challenges of the global economy. ``One of the great debates every society must have is how to balance individual freedom with the need for ... cohesion of families, communities and nation,'' the president said. Despite Clinton's pleas, Vietnam's powerful Communist Party chief said his country would go its own way. ``We respect other nations' choices of lifestyle and political systems,'' Le Kha Phieu was quoted as telling Clinton. ``We also demand other nations respect our country's political system and choices.'' Clinton, after two days in Hanoi, arrived near midnight Saturday. Despite the hour, thousands lined the route for his 15-minute drive from the airport, many waving, some cheering, as his motorcade swept by. Before leaving Vietnam on Sunday, Clinton also met with Jean-Baptiste Pham Minh Man, the Roman Catholic archbishop of Ho Chi Minh City. They talked for several minutes at city hall after Clinton addressed business leaders. National Security Council spokesman P.J. Crowley said they spoke about problems the archbishop faces in a country where international human rights groups cite a pattern of harassment and imprisonment of Buddhist and other religious leaders. The president also met with the mayor, Vo Viet Thanh. Ahead of Clinton's appearances, police broke up a sit-in by more than 150 peasants who had camped out beneath protest banners for several months near a government office. The communist government's decision to allow the protest over land to go on for so long suggested a gradual loosening of official controls. But the peaceful overnight dispersal revealed the limits of what the regime will tolerate, as well as its sensitivity to international scrutiny during the U.S. president's visit. Leaving Hanoi, Clinton stood at attention on a floodlit tarmac as a U.S. military honor guard took possession of the remains of three missing Americans and sent them to Hawaii for identification. Much of Saturday was devoted to American MIAs and Vietnamese children maimed from leftover mines and bombs in the Vietnam War, subjects that weighed heavily on Clinton's emotions. The president visited a rice paddy outside Hanoi where recovery workers were digging through mud for any remains of Air Force fighter pilot Lawrence G. Evert, whose jet crashed on a bombing run in 1967. Evert's sons, David and Daniel from Chandler, Ariz., accompanied the president. ``When we were younger, about 6 and 8, we used to talk about how we would come over to Vietnam and come get him out of jail _ we thought he was alive so we thought we'd come get him and take him home and rescue him,'' said David, now 39. ``And we kind of feel like that's what we're doing right now.'' Tears welled in Clinton's eyes as he stood on a bamboo-supported platform beside the excavation pit. ``Whether we are American or Vietnamese,'' Clinton said, ``I think we all want to know where our loved ones are buried.'' Clinton is the first president in 31 years to visit Vietnam and the first ever to stop in Hanoi. In a farewell meeting with President Tran Duc Luong in Hanoi, he joked about the U.S. election stalemate: ``I have to go home to see if there's a president.'' Luong called Clinton's visit ``a new page'' in relations. ``It's a shame this is so short,'' Luong said. ``I hope the next U.S. president will continue what we have started.'' U.S. Ambassador Pete Peterson said the visit had improved understanding and trust between the two nations. After losing 58,000 Americans in Vietnam, the United States withdrew its combat forces in 1973. Two years later, on April 30, 1975, a rear guard of 11 Marines scrambled aboard a helicopter at the U.S. Embassy in a blaze of tear gas and smoke grenades. They fled Saigon as communist forces surged into the city and the U.S.-backed government announced an unconditional surrender. Saigon was renamed Ho Chi Minh City in honor of the revolutionary leader who declared Vietnam's independence from French rule in 1945 and led the struggle against the United States. In a striking gesture of reconciliation, Clinton went to the Communist Party headquarters in Hanoi and chatted amiably with party secretary Phieu. Vietnam began opening its economy in the mid-1980s. The effort waned during the Asian financial crisis, but then Vietnam signed a bilateral trade agreement with the United States in July that will force major reforms. ``We have a private economic sector, but we do not privatize the entire economy. We are reorganizing cooperatives, not dismantling them,'' Phieu said in remarks quoted by the Communist Party newspaper Nhan Dan. The president also attended a ceremony intended to raise consciousness about unexploded mines and bombs that still wound or kill 2,000 Vietnamese a year. Clinton called land mines ``the curse of innocent children all over the world.'' He said there are about 300,000 tons of unexploded ordnance and about 3.5 million land mines buried in Vietnam. ___ On the Web: CIA World Factbook: http://www.odci.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/vm.html

In a shift that is likely to brighten prospects for a global warming treaty, American negotiators at talks here have said the United States would be willing to limit its use of forest projects to reach its target for reducing heat-trapping greenhouse gases. The new stance, signaled in the face of mounting criticism from Europe and private environmental groups, came this weekend, halfway through a contentious two-week session aimed at writing the fine print for the treaty, called the Kyoto Protocol. The treaty was worked out by more than 170 nations in Japan in 1997. If ratified, it would commit three dozen industrialized nations to reduce their combined greenhouse-gas releases by 2010 to at least 5 percent below what their emissions were in 1990, with each country taking a unique target depending on its emissions. But the rules and means to achieve cuts have never been resolved, with this session, called the Sixth Conference of the Parties, intended as the denouement. Many disagreements in these pivotal negotiations have focused on the role of forests as ``sinks,'' in which carbon dioxide, a warming gas flooding the atmosphere from the burning of fossil fuels and forests, is removed by trees, which store the carbon in wood and soil. The United States, by far the largest emitter of greenhouse gases, calculated last summer that its vast forests, by absorbing up to 300 million tons a year of carbon dioxide, could help it get halfway to its pledged target under the treaty, reducing emissions by 2012 to 7 percent below where they were in 1990. It also wants to get credit for paying for forest-protection and tree-planting projects in other countries. But Europe, too crowded to take advantage of forests, and many private environmental groups say crediting forest growth would allow the United States and other large, forested countries to meet their targets without undertaking the much harder, and potentially costlier, task of reducing greenhouse gases at the source: mainly tailpipes and smokestacks. ``This is a major free ride for the U.S., a get-out-of-jail-free card the likes of which has never ben seen,'' said Kert Davies, a representative of Greenpeace USA lobbying at the talks. Last week, in sharply rejecting a preliminary American proposal for phasing in the use of forest credits, the European Union described sinks as ``a free gift.'' Frank E. Loy, the undersecretary of state for global affairs and chief American negotiator, said forests were one of several treaty components that American negotiators see as essential to any agreement that is both effective and cost-effective _ and that will satisfy a highly skeptical Senate, whose approval the treaty needs. ``If an agreement doesn't take into account the fact that forests can act as a huge source of emissions as well as an important opportunity to reduce emissions, it will be a very unsatisfactory exercise,'' Loy said. But other American negotiators explained that they were prepared to compromise on the amount of carbon dioxide absorbed by forests for which a country could receive credit, moving beyond an earlier proposal that would phase in credit for forests from 2008 to 2012. ``We are prepared to discount some of the tons that would come through the process,'' one official said. Loy said the United States was committed to acting aggressively on home turf to curtail emissions, but insisted that there should be flexibility to use every emissions-cutting tool available wherever it could be used most effectively. ``We've always thought of sinks as being part of the answer,'' he said. ''They're not intended to take the place of investments in environmentally sound technologies.'' In a news conference late last week, Jos Delbeke, the head of the climate section of the European Commission, said that so far, the American proposal was ``far too vague and far too incomplete'' and would be acceptable only when there were hard numbers showing a clear retreat from large forest credits. Many other disagreements between blocs of countries remained unresolved over the weekend, including whether countries should be able to get credit toward emissions goals for investing in pollution-cutting projects abroad, and whether such projects should include controversial technologies like nuclear power and ``clean coal'' plants _ or forest projects. Environmental campaigners used theatrics to make points. On Saturday, several thousand people from 40 countries built a dike of 50,000 sandbags around the sprawling convention center, meant to highlight one of the perils expected in a warmer world. Scientists predict that continued global warming will disrupt ecosystems and weather patterns and also raise sea levels as glaciers melt. In the lobby, demonstrators presented a petition seeking much deeper emissions cuts to the president of the conference, Jan Pronk, the Dutch environment minister. ``We're trying to build a dike of words,'' Pronk responded. Acknowledging the rifts still sharply dividing countries, he added, ``It's extremely difficult to take actions now to protect people not yet born, but that is what we are trying to do.'' As several thousand delegates combed through hundreds of bracketed paragraphs in reams of treaty text, lobbyists for companies promoting everything from windmills to nuclear plants roamed the hallways, along with a similar number of campaigners from environmental groups. Despite the clashing mosaic of stances, many delegates, from both rich and poor countries, said they had a sense _ after more than a decade of meetings leading to the treaty _ that agreement could be reached, mainly because a growing number of nations were seeing the deal as an opportunity for economic growth and not simply an environmental pact. ``There is no great aggressiveness from the developing countries now, not like there was in 1990,'' said a delegate from a large Asian country. He added that rich countries, in turn, are now asking ``how do we expand commercial investment opportunities and sell our technologies.'' Observers who had attended previous talks agreed that the atmosphere was different, and that Europe and the United States _ despite outward discord _ seemed poised for compromise. ``The gulf doesn't seem to be as wide,'' said Sen. Michael B. Enzi, R-Wyo., a coal-rich state, who attended the Kyoto talks and another session in Buenos Aires and remains skeptical that the treaty will be fair to the United States. ``Compared to Kyoto,'' he said, ``they almost appear to be agreeing.'' Still, some camps seemed determined to scuttle the talks. One point deemed essential by the United States is some clause that at least implies that fast-growing countries like China and India commit more concretely to initiate climate-protection programs. The Senate has said it will not approve a treaty without this. To some, this presented an opportunity. A lobbyist for oil-producing countries described how they were successful _ for the third climate-treaty conference in a row _ at putting pressure on the organizers before the opening gavel to delete from the agenda any consideration of such a commitment from developing nations. The strategy? ``They said, `Either we wreck the conference at the start or this gets delayed,''' the lobbyist said. On Sunday afternoon, as delegates girded for the increasingly intense sessions to come, many sought guidance at an ``Ecumenical Service on Climate Change'' at the Cloister Church.

the president is headed home tonight, following a historic trip to vietnam -- a trip as much about the future as it was about the past. last stop -- ho chi minh city, once saigon. abc's john cochran traveling with the president. on his final day in vietnam, president clinton visited the container docks on taigon river, where a quarter of a century ago, american ships unloaded war material. mrclinton told the communist authorities that if they want more american investment, they must move faster toward free trade and a free society. you will grow even more as your economy becomes more open and the rule of law develops. as in hanoi, the president was warmly received by the people in ho chi minh city, at least by those who knew he was here. in much of the country, the state-controlled news media have given little coverage to his visit. it is still a relationship complicated by emotion on both sides. as the american ambassador here said, for some people the war will never end. that is more true of the old than the young. and this is a young country. most vietnamese were born after american troops left. but the authorities have tried to make sure the war is never forgotten, a war in which 3 million vietnamese died. the art museum here has an entire floor devoted to paintings of the fight against america. still, american officials say the vietnamese are cooperating fully in trying to recover the remains of missing americans. the emotional high-point of the president's visit came when he saw vietnamese working to find the remains of pilot who may have crashed here 33 years ago. the pilot's sons expressed their appreciation. we want them to know that we love them, and we don't hold any animosity toward them at all. mr. clinton also attended a ceremony for three americans whose remains were recovered and will be sent home for identification. neither side got everything they wanted from his visit. the communists made no promises to respect human rights, and mr. clinton refused apologize for the war. still, he came here, and for the vietnamese, that is no small thing. john cochran, abc news, ho chi minh city.

After a week of preliminary talks, key international leaders began arriving Sunday to bargain over the toughest aspects of curbing emissions that are changing the Earth's climate. Some 2,000 lower-level officials did what they could to prepare the ground for the final week of negotiations among environment ministers or cabinet-rank officers from at least 150 countries, but they failed to resolve differences over how best to protect the planet. U.S. officials said Sunday that they felt their efforts to find common ground and be flexible had not been returned by their European counterparts. The United States has been singled out for criticism for what environmentalists and some governments call its effort to wriggle out of commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. ``What we want is a way that makes it work without penalizing the economies of the world and our economy,'' said Sen. Larry Craig, R-Idaho. Craig and Sen. Chuck Hagel, R-Nebraska, were sent by Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott to observe the negotiations by the Clinton administration. An eight-member team from the House of Representatives is expected soon. If the conference ends in agreement, any treaty enforcing a new global code of behavior on emissions will require ratification by most of the industrial countries. Without a U.S. endorsement, it would be difficult for such a treaty to come into force. The U.S. Senate already has passed a resolution making its ratification conditional on assurances that the U.S. competitiveness on world markets will not be harmed. A select group of leading policy makers held informal closed-door talks in The Hague ahead of a ceremony Monday marking the start of the critical second phase of the conference. The politicians are working toward a comprehensive plan to reduce the Earth's output of heat-trapping gasses from businesses, farms and automobiles, without bloating national budgets or hampering the global economy. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a board of 2,000 leading scientists, projects that in the coming 100 years there will be more rainfall, a temperature increase of up to 10.8 Fahrenheit and a sea-level rise of up to 30 inches. On Saturday, thousands of activists from around the world erected a sandbag dike around the Dutch conference venue, symbolizing the threat of melting ice caps and harsher seasons. An agreement reached in 1997 in Kyoto, Japan, called for a worldwide reduction of carbon-based gas emissions by an average 5.2 percent below 1990 levels. The target date for the reductions was 2012. Europe is committed to cutting emissions 8 percent, Japan 6 percent and the United States 7 percent. On Thursday, the European Union rejected a proposal from the United States which would enable it to meet half its Kyoto target without reducing emissions. As part of a wide-ranging package of free market proposals, the United States wants to be able to trade carbon emission credits and purchase foreign sinks. Despite the confrontation between the United States and the European Union, the first week of talks was not entirely without progress. An important advance came from a number of leading U.S. agricultural groups which pledged to be part of a climate change solution if the government helps them to adopt new, expensive farming techniques. Farms can substantially reduce atmospheric carbon levels if, instead of tilling the soil, they coat the land with emission-trapping resins. ``There are reasons for adopting no-till farming techniques, but it's not a cost-free enterprise,'' said John McClelland of the National Corn Growers Association. ``We want to be a part of the solution, not just part of the problem.'' Most U.S. farms drain the land of carbon with outdated plowing methods which pollute the water and the air.

Mr. Fujimori made his announcement during a visit in Japan and it was unclear if he intends to return to Peru to tender his resignation. That resignation comes amid a corruption scandal involving Mr. Fujimori's fugitive ex-intelligence Chief Vladimiro Montecinos.

President Clinton is on his way home from an historic 3-day visit to Vietnam. Before leaving Ho Chi Minh City, he told Cable News Network that the trend toward freedom in Vietnam is virtually irreversible. This country has made a lot of progress in the last few years. The economy is diversifying. It's becoming more open to the rest of the world. Sixty percent of the people are under 30 years old. Most of them have no memory at all of the war. Mr. Clinton said Vietnam can fulfill its potential and attract foreign investment only if it further opens up its society.

This is VOA News now in Washington. I'm Ray Krugell. After 10 years in power, Peru's embattled President Alberto Fujimori says he will resign on Monday or Tuesday. Mr. Fujimori had originally said he would remain in office until elections could be held in April. His latest comments to the Peruvian people were made in a written statement from Tokyo. They come at a time when his government is enmeshed in a scandal involving his former intelligence Chief Vladimir Montecinos. Mr. Montecinos was video taped, apparently offering a bribe to an opposition Congressman and trying to get him to support President Fujimori. Following the President's announcement, came word his cabinet would resign as well. British journalist Sally Bowen has been based in the Peruvian capital for several years and told News Now's Tom Crosby, it suddenly seems events are moving at a very fast pace. Yes, it is. In fact, the cabinet hasn't resigned all of it. Well, at least all the 12 ministers who are in Peru at the moment. The Foreign Relations minister is still in Panama where he is coming back. But basically the whole cabinet have resigned. And they say they're indignant of this surprise decision by Fujimori. Why should they be indignant about this. Why react in this manner? I think that they feel they have been covering his back all the time, since he made this also surprise decision in the middle of September, to cut short his presidential period. The economy minister said several times you know, "We thought we were a cabinet coming in with a new government, with new policies and we are going to get back on track and democratize the country and do economic reforms'. And he said, "Within a month, you know, within six weeks we discover we are an outgoing cabinet". They have kept loyal to Fujimori. I mean the last few days, amid rumors that Fujimori might not come back, they have been supporting him, and I think they just feel very let down. I think that's the reason for the indignance. Indeed, you noted that President Fujimori made his announcement from Japan where he is visiting. And I gather from what you are saying there is some question as to whether or not he may return to Peru? He made, his departure, let's say, last Monday was very unexpected. He didn't inform the cabinet that he was going until he was on the way to the airport. He took a very strange and circuitous route and apparently dropped off a large number of boxes and suitcases in the United States on the way. And on Wednesday, one of the former opposition Congress people said he had his own very good information that Fujimori was not going to come back and he was going to take political asylum. And senior cabinet ministers pooh poohed this and said that it was irresponsible rumor mongering. But, you know, it seems to have been closer to the truth than they believed at the time. Sally, if he were to return, would he be facing some sort of possible criminal indictment or that kind of thing? Not so far as we know at that moment. As you probably know there is a major investigation underway of Vladimiro Montecinos, his security advisor for the past 10 years. Indeed. And Montecinos has now been charged with money laundering, drug trafficking, corruption of public officials, a whole - oh, torture, and assassination to name but a few. There's nothing at this moment that seems to involve President Fujimori with any of those charges. But obviously by implication, he is at least tarnished. It may simply turn out to be political responsibility rather than criminal responsibility, but I think, you know, at this stage we don't know where the investigations may lead, and there may be more to come out. Sally, with the President announcing his plans to resign, the cabinet stepping down as well, does this plunge the government into chaos, or is there some sort of an orderly transition that should and could be taking place? I think it would be fair to say that it's pretty chaotic at the moment. Not chaotic in the sense that things are going to fall apart tomorrow, and the armed forces incidently have put out a communiqu saying that they completely respect the constitutionally elected authorities and whatever they decide, so that's you know, that's one element of worry or concern that we seem to be able to forget about for the moment. But the succession is not clear. The Vice President of Fujimori resigned four weeks ago when Montecinos came back. So, the first Vice President theoretically is no longer in the running. The second Vice President is a very low profile character and we have only just got a new President to the Congress about 3 or 4 days ago and I think what we'll find in the next couple of days is a sort of power struggle between the second Vice President and the President of Congress, and probably the opposition will prefer the latter. Indeed, the second Vice President Ricardo Marquez is quoted in news reports as saying he is ready to head-up a transition government. He has said that today, although he has said 2 or 3 days ago that if President Fujimori were to resign he would also go. I think the opposition argument is that Marquez was involved in the same illegitimate election as President Fujimori himself and is therefore not really the right person to lead the transition. They would prefer this new and, you know, I think unquestionably democratic and constitutional Vice President of Congress, Valentine Paneagua. That's Sally Bowen, a journalist who has been based in Lima, Peru for several years talking with VOA's Tom Crosby. The US embassy in Lima says it is not yet clear who will head the interim government, but a spokesman urged all parties to cooperate, to ensure what he termed a peaceful and constitutional transition. The countries Congress reverted to opposition control last week and lawmakers have repeatedly called for President Fujimori's early resignation.

Thank you Ray. The entire Peruvian cabinet has resigned following Alberto Fujimori's announcement that he will step down as President of Peru within the next 48 hours. As Claire Marshallreports from Lima, Mr. Fujimori's decision comes after a mounting bribery scandal involving his former security chief. In a televised news conference, the Peruvian Prime Minister Fredericque Salas announced the resignation of all the members of the cabinet following President Fujimori's decision to leave office after a decade of rule. Mr. Salas said that the cabinet members were indignant at having to take this step, and were all highly critical of the President's decision to announce his resignation whilst on a hastily arranged trip to Japan. Amid some confusion as to who will take up the reins of power, the second Vice President, Ricardo Marquez said that he is ready to assume the presidency of Peru. However, it is unclear whether the opposition, which now controls Congress, will accept this move. Opposition party leader Alehandre Toledo, has said that Mr. Marquez does not have legitimacy to assume the role. This is Claire Marshallfor VOA News in Lima.

President Clinton says the trend toward freedom in Vietnam is strong. He is now on his way home after a three-day landmark visit there. While describing the trend as almost impossible to reverse, Mr. Clinton said Vietnam will only fulfill its potential and attract foreign investment if it further opens its society. He made the comments in a TV interview with CNN where he also talked about Vietnam's cooperation in finding missing American soldiers from the Vietnam war. Mr. Clinton says he visited one crash site with the sons of an American pilot believed to have crashed there. I was very grateful for the cooperation we received from the Vietnamese government and the individual villagers, you know, there were these people out there stomping around in the mud, trying to find some trace of those boys' father. In an earlier speech Mr. Clinton said the future of Vietnam and its young people lies in a new era of capitalism, innovation and competition.

01:36 Universal time, you are listening to VOA News Now. In Washington, I'm Ray Krugell. Ivory Coast's new civilian government is calling for reconciliation among all ethnic and political factions following the worst bout of violence in the country's history. Many international observers are looking at the parliamentary elections slated for early December as a test of President Laron Gbagbo's resolve to build an inclusive government. Today's Dateline examines the roots of the political turmoil in a country once known as "The Jewel of West Africa." Here is Carol Castiel. Since independence from France in 1960, Ivory Coast, the world's top cocoa producer, was seen as a model of economic prosperity and stability in West Africa. That image was shattered last December when a mutiny by soldiers escalated into a coup that deposed President Henri Konan Bedie. VOA correspondent, Louis Ramirez, explains why the take over met with little popular opposition. Despite its international reputation for stability, many Ivorians welcomed the coup. The Bedie administration, they believed had brought Ivory Coast widespread corruption and rapid economic decline, much of which Mr. Bedie blamed on the country's vast population of immigrant workers from neighboring nations. When General Robert Guei assumed power after the December coup, he like Mr. Bedie, sought to use the immigrants to his advantage. In his campaign to be elected as a civilian President, the General sought to discredit his main opponent at the time, former Prime Minister Alassane Ouattara, by claiming Mr. Ouattara is not fully Ivorian. The Ivorian Supreme Court last month barred Mr. Ouattara from running against General Guei in the elections citing doubts about his nationality. The government claimed one of Ouattara's parents is from neighboring Burkina Faso. Mr. Ouattara enjoys support among the Juelus-speaking Muslims of Northern Ivory Coast who complained they have been shut out of national politics by Southern Christians. Many of the northerners are of Burkinabe descend. Tensions between members of the two groups burst last month when Ouattara's supporters took to the streets following the October 22nd Presidential elections. They battled Loran Gbagbo's mostly Christian supporters who had forced General Robert Guei from power on October 25th after the General tried to declare himself the winner of elections despite a victory by Mr. Gbagbo. As many as 200 people were killed in three days of post election violence that included the burning of churches and mosques. This week, as part of a drive for reconciliation, President Gbagbo publicly shook hands with General Guei, who came out of hiding for the first time since his ouster. Mr. Gbagbo says what is important for me as Head of State of Ivory Coast, but also for the people, is that the country enter more and more into a process of re-building, of reconciliation. But many followers of Mr. Ouattara and his RDR accuse the government of not being sincere in its call for national unity. This Ouattara supporter, a 28-year-old teacher, says he believes reconciliation cannot occur unless the people of the North can fully participate in the political system. He says the only condition by which we will truly have peace is by letting Mr. Ouattara run for President and recognize his Ivorian nationality. He says the government must recognize his eligibility and recognize at the same time the people from the North are Ivorian. In an effort to placate the northerners, Loran Gbagbo has named a number of Juelus-speaking Muslims to top positions in his government but has rejected the RDR's demands for new Presidential elections. The new civilian government is promising transparency in the December 10th legislative election. The race is open to all Ivorians including those who are of foreign descent. VOA's Louis Ramirez reporting from the commercial capital Abidjan. Professor of History at Harvard University in Washington, Jeannie Madix Tungata is not optimistic about President Gbagbo's ability to unify a country that has over 60 ethnic groups and a large immigrant population. National reconciliation will be a problem for him. That's probably the foremost issue on his agenda at this time. Cutigua is composed of over 60 different ethnic groups. The first President and, you know, founding father of the nation, Ufwet Bueni understood the difficulties of holding together this nation with such strong ethnic identities in the region. So, national unity has always been a problem. Professor Tungata pointed out that Ivory Coast's first President Felix Houphouet-Boigny deliberately suppressed the formation of several political parties saying they would inevitably divide along ethnic lines and weaken national unity. So, he consolidated power under one party, the Democratic party of Ivory Coast, known as the PDCI. Upon Ufwet Bueni's death in 1993, two other major political parties emerged. The Rally of the Republicans or RDR, an offshoot of the PDCI, and the popular Ivorian front or FPI. When Ufwet died, Mr. Henri Konan Bedie assumed power. And as Louis Ramirez reported Mr. Bedie's rule became synonyms with mismanagement and corruption. To fend off political rivals, Mr. Bedie stirred up Xenophobia aimed at Muslim northerners. As Professor Tungata explains, it was Mr. Bedie who introduced the exclusionary concept of . In Cotibua, Henri Konan Bedie initiated this system to determine whether people residing within the country would be allowed to have the national identity card. This national identity card is necessary if in fact people are to vote. The effort for peoples from the South to then exclude peoples from the North from attaining their identity cards then became an issue. Why did this become an issue at this time? Henri Konan Bedie, as he moved closer and closer to the election of 2000, knew that Alassane Ouattara would be returning from the International Monetary Fund. Alassane Ouattara had served as an appointed Prime Minister under Ufwet and had been quite popular in that role. And he had actually begun to build a consistuency of support within the country. General Robert Guei who overthrew Mr. Bedie in a bloodless coup last December, perpetuated the notion that Mr. Ouattara, a Muslim from the North, was not a native of the Ivory Coast. However, Professor Tungata asserted that earlier Supreme Court rulings refuted that claim. It was clear through the investigations of the Supreme Court at that time, that Alassane Ouattara was in fact Ivorian. His mother was born in the Ogene region. His father was born in the region of Cong and had served in the French Civil Service. It was in the French tradition to send their civil servants to any of their colonies within the region. So, at the time of independence, Alassane Ouattara's father was serving in the French Civil Service in Upper Volta. Upper Volta, which is known today as Burkina Faso is just across the border from Ivory Coast. Subsequently, Mr. Ouattara was awarded a scholarship to the United States and travel documents from Burkina Faso. Again, Professor Tungata. And so here begins the saga and the destruction of the character of Alassane Ouattara. Despite being barred from the recent presidential election, which elevated Laron Gbagbo to power, Mr. Ouattara does plan to contest the upcoming parliamentary elections on behalf of the RDR. Professor Tungata says these elections are crucial to Ivory Coast's international credibility. The transparency of the legislative elections in Gbagbo's capacity to ensure that these are free and fair elections, will determine the direction of the Western nations and their attitude towards the Gbagbo regime. However, if the recent ethnic and religious violence continues to rack the Ivory Coast, it is doubtful that elections will unfold without incident. Ivory Coast politics was the subjects of today's Dateline. I'm Carol Castiel.

President Alberto Fujimori submitted his resignation to Congress in a letter Monday, making good on his pledge to end 10 years of iron-fisted rule that reshaped Peru. ``I submit to you, Mr. President of Congress, my formal resignation as president of the republic,'' Fujimori wrote in a two-page letter to Congress President Valentin Paniagua. A copy was faxed to The Associated Press by the Government Palace. ``I am the first to recognize that there is a new political scenario in the country,'' said Fujimori in the letter. Fujimori's letter spoke of a ``new correlation of forces.'' It was an apparent reference to the fact that opposition lawmakers won control of Congress last week. The letter did not elaborate, but a motion had been placed before the 120-seat legislature to remove Fujimori as president on constitutional grounds of ``moral incapacity.'' Fujimori, the iron-fisted leader who won enormous popular support by smashing leftist insurgencies and rampant hyperinflation in the 1990s, found himself pilloried by those who once hailed him as Peru's savior.

President Alberto Fujimori submitted his resignation to Congress in a letter Monday, making good on his pledge to end 10 years of iron-fisted rule that reshaped Peru. ``I submit to you, Mr. President of Congress, my formal resignation as president of the republic,'' Fujimori wrote in a two-page letter to Congress President Valentin Paniagua. A copy was faxed to The Associated Press by the Government Palace. ``I am the first to recognize that there is a new political scenario in the country,'' said Fujimori in the letter. Fujimori's letter spoke of a ``new correlation of forces.'' It was an apparent reference to the fact that opposition lawmakers won control of Congress last week. The letter did not elaborate, but a motion had been placed before the 120-seat legislature to remove Fujimori as president on constitutional grounds of ``moral incapacity.'' Fujimori, the iron-fisted leader who won enormous popular support by smashing leftist insurgencies and rampant hyperinflation in the 1990s, found himself pilloried by those who once hailed him as Peru's savior. Fujimori acknowledged ``errors'' during his 10 years of rule but insisted he had always acted in Peru's best interests. He said he was stepping aside for the good of the country. Fujimori, on a visit to his ancestral homeland Japan, had announced in a written statement earlier Monday that he would resign within 48 hours. It was not clear when _ or if _ he would return to Peru. Japanese officials said Monday that Fujimori had not requested political asylum. But Mary Ellen Countryman, a spokeswoman for the U.S. National Security Council, said Monday that Peruvian officials have informed the U.S. government that Fujimori would stay in Japan indefinitely. Fujimori was initially popular for defeating the powerful Marxist Shining Path and Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement guerrillas _ which controlled much of Peru's countryside and shantytowns, and ending annual inflation that topped 7,000 percent when he took office in 1990. The signature moment of his autocratic, hands-on leadership style came in 1996 when he personally directed the rescue of 74 hostages held by Tupac Amaru rebels in the Japanese ambassador's residence in Lima. The siege ended with commandoes storming the building, killing all 14 rebels. But his popular support was eroded by lingering poverty, weariness with his autocratic ways and his close ties to his shadowy spymaster Vladimiro Montesinos, who critics charge with corruption and human rights abuses. Many Peruvians felt relief that Fujimori was finally leaving. ``I have been praying to God for Fujimori to go. He has gone but he left behind a country in ruins with people who are hungry, impoverished and without jobs,'' said Patricia Cerna Egoavil, 36, an activist with women's groups. Fujimori and Montesinos had controlled almost all aspects of Peruvian society _ from congress to the courts to television stations _ and his resignation has set off a power struggle to fill the vacuum he leaves. It was the release in September of a videotape apparently showing Montesinos bribing an opposition congressman that launched the scandal that prompted Fujimori's downfall. Fujimori's trip abroad had fueled speculation at home that he would go into exile in Asia. Second Vice President Ricardo Marquez said Sunday that he was ready to assume the presidency and lead Peru to special elections on April 8. But the issue of succession was clouded by controversy. Under the constitution, the first vice president takes over when the president resigns. But First Vice President Francisco Tudela resigned after Montesinos returned to Peru on Oct. 23 following a failed asylum bid in Panama. Congress, however, had yet to accept his resignation. Opposition Congressman Fernando Olivera said lawmakers would move to ratify Tudela's resignation unless he withdrew it before the end of the day Monday. Radio reports said Tudela returned from a trip abroad early Monday and was meeting in his house with opposition Congressman Rafael Rey _ raising speculation he would pursue a claim for the post. If the first vice president were out of the running, the second vice president is constitutionally the next in line. Meanwhile, other opposition lawmakers questioned Marquez's democratic credentials and said they would call for his resignation to pave the way for Paniagua, the recently elected Congress president, to take office. Paniagua, a political moderate who was installed last week by opposition legislators, would be constitutionally next in line after the first and second vice presidents. ``Marquez is a person linked to Fujimori's inner circle,'' said Congresswoman Milagros Huaman. ``We are going to ask for Marquez's resignation.'' Arriving in Madrid on Sunday on his way back to Peru, opposition leader Alejandro Toledo called on Paniagua to take over running the country and rejected calls for immediate elections. ``We need the most stable conditions for transition possible,'' Toledo told a brief news conference. ``We need time to deactivate the intelligence services of Montesinos.'' Leading opposition lawmakers left an emergency meeting Monday morning saying they planned to reject Fujimori's resignation, convene Congress on Tuesday and throw him out of office. Fujimori, 62, has seen his authoritarian rule crumble since the September release of the Montesinos videotape. It prompted him to announce two months ago that he would step down next July after new elections in April. Fujimori tried to distance himself from Montesinos and launched a highly visible but unsuccessful manhunt for the fugitive, believed to be in hiding in Peru. But in the ensuing scandal, critics said Fujimori's disregard for democratic checks and balances provided fertile ground for Montesinos to create a network of alleged extortion, drug trafficking and arms dealing. Investigators said they discovered foreign bank accounts containing at least $58 million in illicit funds allegedly laundered by the ex-spy chief. Montesinos faces criminal complaints in Peru ranging from directing state-sponsored death squads and torture to skimming profits from the narcotics trade during his 10 years as Fujimori's top aide. Fujimori won a third five-year term last May in a vote marred by irregularities and boycotted by international observers. His foes said Montesinos masterminded an illegal campaign that used intimidation, fraud and dirty tricks to ensure the win.

Alberto Fujimori came into the presidency as a political outsider and quickly became known as ``The Emperor'' for his authoritarian style. He helped end the economic chaos of the 1980s and defeated leftist insurgencies, offering hope to Peruvians. After weeks of scandal, Fujimori resigned Monday, in a letter sent to Congress while on a visit to his ancestral homeland, Japan. Fujimori arrived there Friday after leaving Peru unexpectedly in the midst of a deepening political crisis. ``His exit from Lima had all the characteristics of a furtive escape from justice,'' said Mario Vargas Llosa, the Peruvian novelist defeated by Fujimori in 1990 elections, speaking in a radio interview from Madrid. When Fujimori took power, he faced a country many Peruvians feared had become ungovernable. Leftist rebels rattled the capital with nightly car bombs. Electricity was rationed. Foreign investors had fled the country. Prices jumped daily. Basic food items were in short supply. Fujimori put an end to the economic chaos and defeated the leftist insurgencies. But with time, Fujimori's goal seemed to be power itself, at any cost. And the same Peruvians who once saw Fujimori as a savior celebrated his ignominious exit from power. ``After my 2-year-old granddaughter, Fujimori's resignation is the greatest gift God has given me,'' said Lucia Canales, 45, who joined hundreds of protesters in front of the Government Palace to celebrate Monday. ``Fujimori didn't keep his 1990 campaign slogan of Honesty, Jobs and Technology. He left us with corruption, unemployment and poverty.'' Fujimori acknowledged in an interview after his tainted re-election in May to a third, five-year term that his government was an ``imperfect democracy.'' ``I have a particular governing style that puts great emphasis on efficiency,'' he said. Efficiency, for Fujimori, translated into a disregard for the checks and balances of democracy. Fujimori seized dictatorial powers in April 1992, dissolving the opposition-controlled Congress and closing the courts _ moves supported by a majority of Peruvians, fed up with weak and ineffective governments. A new constitution was written and a new Congress elected, dominated by his supporters. He was re-elected in 1995 by an electorate grateful for an end to the guerrilla violence and inflation that topped 7,000 percent in 1990. The son of impoverished Japanese immigrants who picked cotton for a living, Fujimori had a common touch that appealed to Peru's poor. He donned Andean ponchos on his trips into the rural interior, more comfortable with Indian peasants than at cocktail parties. But his May re-election came amid rampant irregularities and allegations of fraud. With his support already eroded by lingering poverty, his popularity plummeted. David Scott Palmer, a Boston University professor and authority on Peruvian politics, said that if Fujimori had not sought a third term, ``he would have gone out as someone who had really made a contribution to the country.'' Over the years, Fujimori showed himself to be shrewd and calculating, a high-stakes gambler bent on winning at any cost. Fujimori's close association with his former spy chief Vladimiro Montesinos, finally brought him down, with the revelation of scale of corruption never before seen in Peru. Montesinos is wanted for alleged money laundering after Swiss authorities froze $48 million in accounts linked to the former spymaster. The amount swelled to $58 million after other accounts were discovered. Few Peruvians believe Fujimori's assertion that he had no inkling of Montesinos' criminal activities, and recall his pledge to wage a war on corruption when he first took office. ``The incredible thing is that his government is now being stained and destroyed by the corrupt ones he employed to help him stay in power,'' said Hernando de Soto, an international economist who worked closely with Fujimori in the early 1990s.

President Alberto Fujimori, who brought leftist insurgencies and economic chaos to heel but ran roughshod over Peruvian democracy, cut short an unprecedented third term and resigned Monday. The move set off an immediate scramble over who would replace him. But a Fujimori ally who's next in line for the post, Second Vice President Ricardo Marquez, announced late Monday he was stepping down. That move averted a political showdown with the opposition-controlled Congress and virtually guaranteed that Congress President Valetin Paniagua, who follows Marquez in the constitutional line of succession, would become Peru's next chief executive. Paniagua is political moderate who's aligned with the opposition. Fujimori, 62, formalized his resignation hours earlier with a letter sent from his ancestral homeland, Japan. The bespectacled son of Japanese immigrants, Fujimori soared into office 10 years ago in a stunning election upset. But with his popularity eroded by a corruption scandal he was unable to control, Fujimori sent the resignation letter, acknowledging his ``errors'' but staunchly defending his decade in power. Fujimori's resignation initially caught the country's leadership off guard and angered allies who complained he should have stepped down at home. ``I submit to you, Mr. President of Congress, my formal resignation as president of the republic,'' Fujimori wrote in the two-page letter, a copy of which was faxed to The Associated Press by the government. The opposition wrested control of Congress away from Fujimori last week for the first time since his own 1992 ``coup,'' in which he seized unprecedented powers. He closed an opposition-controlled Congress, drafted a new constitution and took on special powers he said were needed to battle Marxist insurgents. In the letter, Fujimori admitted his support had crumbled. ``I am the first to acknowledge that there is a new political scenario in the nation,'' he wrote. In Japan, officials said Fujimori had not requested political asylum. But Mary Ellen Countryman, a spokeswoman for the U.S. National Security Council, said Monday that Peruvian officials have informed the U.S. government that Fujimori would stay in Japan indefinitely. Paniagua said Congress would be called into session Tuesday to take up the resignation. During his comments at a news conference, Marquez backed off an earlier pledge that he would take charge and guide Peru to special elections April 8. Marquez said he now lamented the ``grave political crisis'' touched off by Fujimori's resignation, saying it had put ``democracy and political stability at risk.'' He said he had made the decision to present his ``irrevocable resignation'' as second vice president, adding it would take effect once Congress chooses an interim president to guide a transition to elections. Peter Romero, the U.S. acting assistant secretary of state for western hemisphere affairs, called for an orderly transition after traveling here with a high-level U.S. delegation Monday. Asked about Fujimori's possible replacements, he cautioned, ``Our support is for the process and not for any particular person or party.'' Speaking at a news conference, he pointed to the difficult U.S. presidential election between Republican George Bush and Democrat Al Gore, saying nearly two weeks after that vote, we haven't ``identified the winner yet.'' ``Democracy is a process that is always fraught with problems and disputes, which sometimes appear insurmountable, but each time they're solved, democracy comes out stronger than ever,'' he added. Rushing home from a European trip, Peru's main opposition leader Alejandro Toledo credited common Peruvians with bringing down Fujimori's authoritarian regime. ``Let's build a government based on decent institutions, respect for democratic dignity. This is the dream of the Peruvian people,'' he said through a megaphone, mobbed by supporters at Lima's international airport. Fujimori's letter spoke of a ``new correlation of forces.'' It was an apparent reference to the fact that opposition lawmakers won control of Congress last week. The letter did not elaborate, but a motion had been placed before the 120-seat legislature to remove Fujimori as president on constitutional grounds of ``moral incapacity.'' Prior to his formal resignation letter, Fujimori had announced in a written statement earlier Monday that he would step down within 48 hours.

The Vice President of Peru, Ricardo Marquez has resigned. That move could help resolve the political crisis that followed after President Alberto Fujimori stepped down on Monday. VOA's Bill Rogers reports from Lima. Mr. Marquez made the announcement late Monday, after many of Peru's political leaders made it clear they did not want the Vice President to head a transition government because of his association with Mr. Fujimori. Lacking political support, Mr. Marquez told the nation he is stepping down for the good of the country. His decision paves the way for the Head of the Congress, Valentine Paneagua, to assume the presidency left vacant by Mr. Fujimori's resignation. Mr. Paneagua, an opposition lawmaker, was elected Speaker last week replacing a long time political ally of the ex-President. That action was seen as further undermining Mr. Fujimori's hold on power, which had been crumbling since September in the wake of a bribery scandal that forced the Peruvian leader to call new elections. While in Japan this past weekend, Mr. Fujimori resigned, bringing an end to 10 years of autocratic rule. Monday's developments came as a top US delegation met in Lima with political leaders including Vice President Marquez. Delegation head Peter Romero later told reporters, Washington is supporting a constitutional transfer of power in Peru and is not trying to influence the outcome. Mr. Romero, who is the acting US Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American Affairs, said it is up to the Peruvian Congress and people to determine the nation's future. However, the timing of the visit raised some questions, coming as it did one day after Mr. Fujimori's decision to resign became public. But delegation members said the trip had been planned for weeks so that US officials can meet with Peruvian political leaders to discuss the progress being made in preparing for next year's elections. Artudo Velensuela, who is a Latin American expert at the US National Security Council, told reporters Monday, despite the latest crisis he believes Peru is now on the right track. I think that what you have in play here is a situation where as Peru moves towards a democratic and free election, a transparent election, that this will make it possible for Peruvians to make their choices and to have authorities that are legitimate. There is a long way to go because it requires a significant process of institutionalization, of political reforms, of strengthening of parties and institutions, but nevertheless Peru, I think, is on the right track. Whoever is chosen to replace Mr. Fujimori as President, will preside over a transition government that will organize the new elections which is scheduled for next April. Mr. Fujimori was elected to a third five-year term this past May in a vote marred by irregularities and boycotted by the opposition. Peru's opposition leaders are demanding that reforms be made to ensure the next elections are free and fair so that the newly elected government that takes office next July will be seen as legitimate.

Peruvians are experiencing a problem we Americans can relate to, they are still wondering who the country's next President is going to be. The congress in Lima met today to consider the resignation of Alberto Fujimori who ruled the country with an iron hand for ten years, and to pick a successor. Fujimori sent his resignation from Japan where today he told reporters he intends to become an average citizen, but in Peru Fujimori's actions have sparked outrage according to Andrike Selery, editor of the weekly news magazine, 'Karitas'. The facts of Fujimori resigned from Japan has created considerable indignation. And the options and the debates in congress have been whether to accept the resignation or to sort of kick him out, you know, and to clear the vacancy for moral reasons. Our constitution establishes that procedure also. And this has been basically the debate which is still not absolutely settled. Alberto Fujimori issued a statement today from Japan, why don't we listen to it right now. He basically said that after his resignation, he would become an ordinary citizen in Japan. From the moment when I am no longer President, I shall be an ordinary, everyday citizen. I don't know yet of what status, but I am here in Japan with a diplomatic visa and a diplomatic passport. Has there been a response to that statement as yet in Peru? Well, the fact that he suggests, you know, that he could be an ordinary citizen in Japan accentuates this feeling, you know, that has been part of the whole Fujimori phenomenon. It was this ethnic phenomenon, in which Fujimori being first generation Peruvian, suddenly became President in a country that has a rather remote relationship with Japan. And again there was an element there in which the population of Peru which is mostly somehow chose Fujimori to defeat, let's say what we would call a sort of a white elite which is not absolutely white in a country like Peru. But there was always this question, you know, of whether Fujimori's allegiances were totally in this country. And now we have the terrible situation in which he suddenly seeks asylum, you see, is not formally asylum but he seems to sort of hide in the mother country, you know. And this has produced a tremendous shock and indignation at this point in Peru. We don't know if Fujimori is going to be seeking asylum in Japan, but are Peruvians looking now at his legacy? I mean have they done a "postmortem" on him? Are they looking at him as a figure of Peru's past? Fujimori came in when a change in economic policy occurred all over Latin America you know. Fiscal discipline, it's a fight against inflation, Fujimori put the house in order. But on the other hand, he constantly played down and tried to destroy the political parties. He discredited his predecessors, I mean throughout the Republic sort of thing and he was very, very sort of cruel, you know, and he persecuted people. And there were a lot of scandals before this last event, which the government never investigated. This was basically all sparked when the former spy chief Vladimir Montesseno, Fujimori's right hand man was trying to apparently bribe a congressman and he was caught on videotape. He then left Peru. He has apparently come back now. Do we know his whereabouts in what has come to be a very strange situation? Yes, very, very strange situation. No, we don't, and something happened between him and Fujimori, which is still not clear and then he became a fugitive. And the President himself , you know, of policeman and dogs, I mean you could see the TV shots of this very extraordinary situation with the Head of State chasing a fugitive, to catch him. And in fact the suspicion is to find what he had with him because one feels that Montesseno might have been blackmailing the President himself saying look, you know, be careful with me because I've got videos or documents that can be damaging to yourself, you know. So this has been the whole extraordinary situation. Andrike Selery is the editor of the Peruvian weekly newspaper 'Karitas' speaking to us from Lima, Peru. Thank you very much Andrike. Thank you.

The New York Times said in an editorial for Wednesday, Nov. 22: Alberto Fujimori, the unpredictable and often erratic president of Peru, resigned from office this week while on a visit to Japan. It was a fittingly bizarre exit. The circumstances surrounding Fujimori's decision remain somewhat mysterious, but should not obscure the fact that his departure is a positive development. Peru's citizenry and opposition parties, as well as the international community, should capitalize on this opportunity to encourage the start of a new democratic era in Peru. Valentin Paniagua, a Fujimori opponent and president of Peru's Congress, is poised to assume the nation's presidency until the elections scheduled for April. His caretaker government ought to focus on creating the conditions for a truly free election, conditions that were woefully absent in last summer's contest presided over by Fujimori. Peru must establish an autonomous electoral authority to oversee the process, grant its judiciary independence and provide competing political factions with equal access to the nation's media. More broadly, the new government ought to restore a sense of stability and certainty to Peruvian life. The nation's 27 million people and fragile economy have been held hostage to the whims of Fujimori and his shadowy intelligence chief and indispensable aide, Vladimiro Montesinos. The new government must also pursue investigations into the alleged criminal activities of Montesinos, who reportedly squirreled away at least $58 million in overseas bank accounts and is now believed to be in hiding in Peru. Peruvians living in poverty _ more than half the population _ were the real victims of Fujimori's determination to retain power at all costs. The economy shrank in September as a result of the furor following the broadcast of a video that showed Montesinos paying a bribe to a politician. Fujimori was once the darling of foreign investors, but as his administration became increasingly arbitrary, tax collection rates plummeted, capital fled the country and prospective investment dried up. If a new government carries out meaningful reforms and can restore a sense of social stability, Peru has an opportunity to start making up lost economic ground. Not long ago, Washington would have greeted Fujimori's departure with mixed feelings because of his support for drug interdiction programs. Montesinos had longstanding ties to the CIA. But in recent months Washington wisely distanced itself from both men. The United States should now welcome the formation of a more legitimate caretaker government and offer its assistance to assure that new elections are free and fair.

Protests at climate-treaty talks here reached a high pitch on Wednesday as demonstrators climbed into the rafters of a central room, blockaded doorways, passed out Christmas stockings stuffed with coal and splattered the top American negotiator with a cream pie at a news conference. The incident occurred halfway through the second week of contentious talks, due to end on Friday, in which delegates from 175 countries are debating ways to slow emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases, chiefly from burning fossil fuels. The meeting, seeking to create environmental and economic policies to carry out a treaty negotiated in 1997 in Kyoto, Japan, has been the focus of a growing protests. The demonstration on Wednesday centered on contentions that loopholes would prevent cuts in the use of fossil fuel. The United States under secretary of state for global affairs, Frank E. Loy, had just begun defending the American stance in the talks, which has been criticized by European officials and environmental groups as too weak, when a woman jumped from her seat and threw the pie in his face. Wiping whipped cream from his lip, Loy cut short his talk and later issued a statement that said: ``On the eve of Thanksgiving, pumpkin pie would have been a more traditional choice, but what I really want is a strong agreement to fight global warming. I'm headed back to the negotiating table right now with that aim.'' Environmental groups that are lobbying delegations and observing discussions disavowed the attack. ``Many are frustrated by the slow pace of negotiations and the lack of domestic action against global warming,'' said a letter issued by several dozen environmental groups. ``However we believe there are more constructive ways to achieve our goals of preventing dangerous climate change.'' If ratified, the Kyoto Protocol would commit industrialized nations to reduce their combined greenhouse-gas releases by 2012 to a level at least 5 percent below emissions in 1990. Earlier on Wednesday, negotiators said, some progress had been made on several important sticking points, including the roles of nuclear power and the situation in Russia, where emissions have plunged because of economic decline. That has produced a windfall of pollution credits that Russia might eventually sell to countries that are unwilling or unable to reduce emissions. Nuclear power has been a pivotal issue for the European Union and many environmental groups, which have pressed to have it excluded from a list of technologies that wealthy countries could export to poor countries to help them avoid future emissions of carbon dioxide. But Canada, China and the United States oppose such a ban. And France, despite its outward opposition, relies heavily on nuclear plants for its electricity. On Wednesday night, it appeared that language was evolving that would give strong preference under the treaty to less controversial nonpolluting options like wind turbines, but would not explicitly banish nuclear plants. Separately, Russia proposed that any income it received from selling pollution credits would go into a ``green fund'' that would be used to pay only for energy-efficiency projects. Bill Hare, the chief representative of Greenpeace International and a longtime critic of Russia's selling its pollution credits, said the proposal was a move in the right direction. ``This looks like a positive initiative,'' he said. Jan Pronk, the president of the conference and the Dutch environment minister, said delegates would be pushed to work late into the night through Friday to iron out further differences. But other sharp disagreements remain, particularly between the United States and European Union over how much a country could invest in emissions-cutting projects abroad and how much credit could be earned from growing forests, which absorb carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas.

This is The World, I am Lisa Mullins. The planet is heating up and so are negotiations to reverse the trend, but so far delegates from the 180 nations at The Hague have made little progress toward reaching an agreement. It seems the United States and the European Union have different ideas about how to cut the output of Green House Gases. Andy Ravkin, environment writer for the New York Times is at The Hague where negotiators are looking at all night sessions to try to come up with a pact, by Friday night. Andy, this conference is intended to write the fine print for the Kyoto Protocol, that was the deal struck in Japan three years ago, and it appears as if at least until today, the United States has emerged as environmental enemy number one. I fear to say that in every respect the US is the focal point for a lot of criticism here. And part of it is right on point, we are number one in terms of emission by far, not just in total emissions but also emissions per person, we're double most of the rest of Europe. Talk a little about the reliance of force as a way to trap carbon dioxide, and help the United States meet these goals. This was agreed to three years ago when the framework of this treaty was worked out in Kyoto, Japan, that countries were to be able to use Sinks, meaning sort of sponges, processes that suck carbon dioxide out of the air. The only question that was left unresolved was how much you could employ those practices as opposed to just making your cars and factories cleaner. And that's the sticky sticky point here now. Now the US is saying, well look, you know, when we negotiated this in 1997, we said clearly treaties trees are going to be a big part in what we were doing and we're still saying that. Europe doesn't like the idea, they think they are going to lose out. If the United States were to try to achieve this goal of reducing Green House gases to at least 5% below emissions of 1990, how would we, as individual Americans, be called on to play a role? The administration feels that this can be accomplished without a straight tax on energy. So this will probably be reflected day to day and positive choices you can make that there'll be companies offering what they call Green Power where you can buy your electric power from, a utility that specifically is cutting its emission Green House gases, or there will be more of a shift in the fleet of automobiles towards more efficiency. That's something that definitely is going to come from this. But the Energy Department has just released a study I wrote about last week saying that, short term to get to these reductions, we could do it without much of a hit to the economy at all. Because obviously using less energy costs less money. They are pretty much under the gun, they are now at The Hague. I wonder if you think there's any chance of deal by Friday, and by way if there is, what the chances are that Congress, which is not yet ratified the original Kyoto Deal, might ratify this one? There are people in, coming out of these rooms periodically, do say they feel they're confident that there will be some kind of a signable document. It may be Saturday morning but they are going to have something to take home that many countries feel they can ratify. As you say though, in the United States there's a huge barrier to ratification, which is that 2/3rd of the Senate has to vote to consent to ratification and right now there's just no way that's going to happen. The Senate is starting to change though, two key Republican longstanding critics and skeptics on global warming are here, and in interviews in the last couple of days that there is a problem. They don't see this solution as exactly right and their presumption is that if Bush prevails, they'll see this document evolve into something, that he can ultimately agree to.

Veteran legislator Valentin Paniagua was sworn in Wednesday as interim president of Peru, ending a decade of authoritarian rule by Alberto Fujimori that succeeded in defeating two terrorist rebellions but failed to repair the country's endemic instability. ``One era closes and another opens today in Peru,'' Paniagua, 64, told a packed congressional chamber after he took the oath of office. ``The reinstitution of democracy is our task.'' Paniagua's inauguration, the morning after the opposition-led Congress voted Fujimori ``morally unfit'' to hold office, followed six months of extreme turmoil, during which Fujimori struggled to hold on to power through corruption scandals, riots and a small military rebellion. Earlier this week, Fujimori submitted his resignation in a fax sent from Tokyo _ only to have Congress reject it in favor of dismissing him. This left the untested Paniagua, next in the line of succession as parliamentary speaker, to reunite Peru and oversee a new presidential election next April. Under Peruvian law, Paniagua cannot run in that election. But several contenders have already come forward, notably Alejandro Toledo, the opposition leader who made a strong run against Fujimori in the last election and remains the country's most influential politician. As his first act as president on Wednesday, Paniagua announced that Javier Perez de Cuellar, the former U.N. secretary-general who lost the 1995 presidential election to Fujimori, would lead his coalition Cabinet as prime minister. In Paris, where he has lived since 1995, Perez de Cuellar expressed surprise at his appointment, but said he would return to Peru on Thursday. Wednesday's inauguration ceremony was modest but festive. Cadets in bright red and blue uniforms rode on horseback through the streets of downtown Lima, just as they had only four months ago during Fujimori's third inauguration, carrying spears graced by small Peruvian flags. As Paniagua left the Congress on his way to the presidential palace, he waded into small, enthusiastic crowds and blew kisses. When Paniagua began addressing the people from a balcony of the palace, he was met by chants of ``Justice for Fujimori.'' But Paniagua, by all accounts a shy, judicious man, did not answer. He chose to strike a tone of reconciliation instead, saying, ``Permit me to say to the people of Peru, you can be sure that no Peruvian has an enemy in the palace.'' Having been elected president of Congress only last week, and rising to presidential successor only after the resignations of Fujimori's two vice presidents, Paniagua has had little time to organize a transitional government. With only five months until new elections are scheduled, the former justice minister's first task will be to overhaul an electoral apparatus that was tainted by charges of vote fraud in the elections of last April and May. But he will also be faced with the task of reviving a stalled economy and overhauling a corrupt security apparatus. Coordinating a fractious coalition government could be made all the more difficult by the shadow that Vladimiro Montesinos, Fujimori's former intelligence chief, still casts over the country. Montesinos' intelligence agency was formally disbanded by Fujimori in his last months in office, but most of its officials and functions were transferred to the army _ many of whose top officers remain allied with Montesinos even as he remained in hiding over the last month. Francisco Loayza, a former intelligence official, said he thought Montesinos was now hiding in Paraguay but that he continued to have ``80 to 85 percent of the influence he had before as long as he has all the documents and videos in his collection.'' A senior Clinton administration official estimated that ``there is a 50-50 chance Montesinos is still in Peru.'' Paniagua will also have to decide how strongly he will push investigations of Montesinos and Fujimori, who has said he plans to stay in Japan for now. Both men face various accusations including money-laundering, gun-running and torture. Such inquiries could touch officials who still have powerful positions in the armed forces and the government bureaucracy, and whose services will be needed by the new government. In his inaugural address, Paniagua pointedly promised that he will order the investigation into where about $9 billion in government proceeds from a decade of privatizations have gone. ``It's a beautiful day, but I would not say we don't face fierce storms,'' said Alfonso Grados, a former legislator from Paniagua's Popular Action party. ``We need to get started immediately to hold a free, clean election which has never been done before in Peru.'' Paniagua comes to power at a time when the Peruvian economy is slowing rapidly, with interest rates rising and foreign and domestic investment braking due to the political chaos. The government deficit ballooned in recent months to almost 3 percent of gross domestic product this year, and international creditors are pressuring the government to cut spending in order to reduce the deficit to 1.5 percent of gross domestic product. Handling the economy will be all the more difficult for Paniagua because the coalition he leads has vastly different views on how to handle privatization, public spending and foreign debt. Several of the parties represented in the new government have long histories of corruption. Paniagua, whose small centrist party has not held the presidency since 1985, was chosen last week to lead the Congress by the leaders of several parties precisely because he was viewed as a conciliator. But these uncertainties did not stop the opposition parties from celebrating. Wednesday morning, after the Congress cleared the way for Paniagua's succession to the presidency, scores of opposition legislators stood up to applaud and embrace each other. ``It's finished! It's finished!'' they chanted. ``The dictatorship is finished!''

Seven bombs exploded around Haiti's capital Wednesday, killing a teen-age boy and injuring 14 people in an upsurge of violence before this weekend's presidential election. Also Wednesday, Haiti's Senate voted to confirm Jacques-Edouard Alexis as premier, 20 months after President Rene Preval appointed him by decree. The lower house in considered almost certain to follow suit on Thursday. Robinson Clairvil, 14, was killed on a busy downtown street when a bomb exploded next to him. Another bomb went off downtown, two exploded on the highway to the international airport and three exploded in the suburb of Petionville, police and radio reports said. Shopkeepers in the capital, Port-Au-Prince, closed their stores in panic. Supporters of former President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, expected to win re-election in Sunday's vote, set up flaming tire barricades to protest the pre-vote violence. Protesters carried Clairvil's blood-soaked body on a march past the National Palace to the local morgue. The attacks were the latest in a series that have darkened the weeks preceding the Sunday election in which Aristide and six little-known opponents are running for the presidency. Main opposition parties have boycotted the race, charging that local and legislative elections earlier this year were rigged by the government in favor of Aristide's Lavalas Family party, which won more than 80 percent of the seats. Aristide's Lavalas Family party and opposition spokesmen have accused each other of being responsible for the recent surge of violence. On Nov. 10, unidentified suspects lobbed homemade gasoline bombs in front of four electoral council buildings in greater Port-au-Prince, causing little damage and no injuries. On Nov. 2, self-proclaimed Lavalas Family partisans in Hinche, 45 miles outside the capital, opened fire on a meeting of the Papaye Peasants' Movement, the biggest rural workers' organization in Haiti. They wounded the brother of an outspoken Aristide critic. Parliament is only now confirming a premier. Haiti has not had a premier since June 1997, when then-Premier Rosny Smarth resigned, protesting the tainted legislative elections won by candidates of Aristide's Lavalas Family party. Faced with strong resistance from legislators, Preval appointed Alexis premier by decree in March 1999 with the mission to create conditions favorable for the holding of new elections. Parliament's action formalizes that decree.

A small explosion in the Saudi capital injured three British citizens, the second such blast in a week. The explosion late Wednesday hit a car carrying two men and a woman, all British workers at an unidentified company in Riyadh, the director of Riyadh Police department told the Saudi Riyadh Daily. The three were taken to a hospital, where one was in stable condition with an injured right leg. The other two were slightly injured, the newspaper reported. The British Foreign Office confirmed Wednesday's explosion. A spokesman said it was too early to speculate on the cause. By Thursday morning, the start of the weekend in Saudi Arabia, the street and surrounding mixed residential and business neighborhood were quiet. Workers in the area said they had heard the explosion and saw police arrive to briefly cordon off the area Wednesday night. Last Friday, Christopher Rodway, 48, a British citizen working in a Saudi hospital, died after a small explosion tore through his car, which was believed to have been booby-trapped. Rodway's wife, Jane, 50, was slightly injured. Another Saudi paper, Okaz, quoted Deputy Interior Minister Prince Ahmed as saying the two explosions could be related, but that the three injured Wednesday did not work with the Rodways. ``What happened ... has no political undertones, it is a personal matter,'' Ahmed was quoted as saying. U.S. forces in Saudi Arabia and other parts of the Gulf have been on highest alert since an Oct. 12 attack on the USS Cole killed 17 American sailors in the port of Aden, Yemen. Such an alert level is only issued when an attack occurs in the region or when there is specific information indicating that one may occur. American residents in Saudi Arabia had been reminded of the alert, with the U.S. Embassy describing it as a ``precautionary measure.'' A 1996 truck bombing outside the Khobar Towers housing complex near Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, killed 19 U.S. Air Force personnel and injured more than 500 Americans and Saudis. The previous year, a car bomb blew up at a U.S. military headquarters in Riyadh, killing five Americans.

Little known outside his country, new President Valentin Paniagua has drafted some high-powered help in the daunting task of erasing the vestiges of 10 years of autocratic rule. Former U.N. Secretary-general Javier Perez de Cuellar, Peru's most illustrious son, was tapped Wednesday to be the country's prime minister and to help heal the wounds left by the ouster of Alberto Fujimori. Tarred by a mounting corruption scandal that plunged Peru into a deep political crisis, Fujimori fled the country last week, disgraced and dismissed by lawmakers who declared him morally unfit for office. Fujimori, the son of Japanese immigrants, fled to Japan, where he says he plans to stay indefinitely. But analysts say the 80-year-old Perez de Cuellar's impeccable democratic credentials lend credibility to an interim government whose mandate is to deliver free and fair elections April 8 and turn power over to a new president next July. There was a general sense of optimism here Wednesday as Paniagua, a 64-year-old congressman and leader of a small centrist party, was sworn in to replace Fujimori. ``Democracy undoubtedly has a future here,'' said Luis Pezzoriti, 42, an architect. ``Democracy in Peru over the past decade had been distorted. There basically was a civilian dictatorship.'' The teaming of Paniagua, known in Peruvian political circles as an honest consensus builder, with Perez de Cuellar, an internationally lauded diplomat who personally negotiated the 1987 cease-fire in the Iran-Iraq war, drew a positive response from many Peruvians. ``The economic situation, the lack of work, has left us sad and basically abandoned,'' said Roberto Tello, a 64-year-old salesman. ``We have hope with this new government, even though it's transitional, that things will get better.'' In a radio interview from France, where he lives most of the year, Perez de Cuellar said he had accepted Paniagua's offer to be Peru's prime minister hours before Paniagua took the oath of office in Congress. The career diplomat, who lost a presidential bid against Fujimori in 1995, said he would be back in Peru by Friday to begin working with Paniagua on a new Cabinet. The challenge, he said, would be finding the most capable people, ``with total independence to avoid as much as possible interference of political interests.'' Analysts said Perez de Cuellar's appointment would help open doors in the international community, as well as bridge the bitter political divide between former government loyalists and opposition leaders at home. Fujimori, who won a third five-year term in May elections marred by fraud allegations, saw his iron grip on power broken by a corruption scandal involving his top aide and spy chief, Vladimiro Montesinos. It was the security adviser's appearance in a videotape apparently bribing an opposition congressman that prompted Fujimori's announcement in September that he would call new elections and step down next year. But as the scandal grew, Fujimori submitted his resignation in a letter sent Monday from Japan. Lawmakers refused to accept his resignation, instead opting to dismiss him in a raucous session of Congress late Tuesday night. Still in hiding, Montesinos leaves behind a network of alleged money laundering, narcotics trafficking and influence peddling that investigators say stretches deep into all of Peru's democratic institutions. Paniagua has the mandate of those who vaulted him into the presidency to root out Montesinos' deep-seated influence. But perhaps his greatest challenge will be restoring credibility to the country's tattered democracy. ``Paniagua is honest. He doesn't have any scandals on his political record,'' said Luis Jochamowitz, a historian and author of a biography of Fujimori. ``The election of Paniagua is a prize for his loyalty to the party system after a 10-year period in which the past administration vilified professional politicians, whether they were good or bad.''

With time running out, international negotiators at the U.N. climate conference were at an impasse Thursday over a proposal that would soften the blow of reducing greenhouse gas emissions for the United States. Conference chairman Jan Pronk was expected to present suggestions Thursday aimed at bridging wide gaps among the 180 nations in the talks. ``I will make suggestions which may cause pain, which will cause pain, but there will be a sharing of pain as evenly as possible,'' said Pronk, the Dutch environment minister. Nevertheless, U.S. delegation head Frank Loy said parties were narrowing differences and he expected an agreement during the Thanksgiving weekend. ``We are talking turkey now,'' said Loy, an undersecretary of state. With increasing evidence that the earth's atmosphere is heating up, delegates at the two-week conference are under pressure to reach an agreement by the conclusion of the talks Friday. An international panel of scientists has estimated that average temperatures could rise as much as 11 degrees in the next decade if current trends continue. With the average atmospheric temperature at its hottest point in 100,000 years, scientists are linking a string of environmental disasters worldwide to global warming caused by exhaust from cars, factories and power plants. Negotiators are discussing reduction targets set at a 1997 meeting in Kyoto, Japan. In the next decade, global emissions of carbon dioxide must drop to 5.2 percent below their 1990 levels. Despite the Kyoto agreement, emissions levels in the United States and many other countries have continued to rise, prompting negotiators to look for creative ways to achieve compliance. Proposals include an international market for trading emissions quotas, cross border industrial cleanup projects and so-called ``sinks'' _ the most controversial idea. The United States, the world's leading polluter, has been criticized for wanting to allow liberal use of sinks _ which constitute forests, farmland and other vegetation that soak up heat-retaining gases, at least temporarily. Hurricanes, cyclones, floods and droughts have hardened negotiating positions of European countries and island nations recently struck by extreme weather. The deadlock has exposed explosive global social and economic fault lines reaching far beyond the environmental issue. European patience is running thin over what is characterized as the U.S. administration's reluctance to antagonize business, risk dampening the current economic boom or change wasteful energy habits in America. ``They say American consumers won't pay one more cent for gasoline,'' said Chris Davies, a British member of the European Parliament. ``Our prices are 300-400 percent higher.'' Loy didn't mention any changes in the sinks idea, but announced initiatives to punish those who fail to meet their emissions targets and a long-term fund for poor countries ``The largest emitters would make the largest contributions'' to the fund, Loy said. But the Nigerian environment minister, Sani Zangon Daura, rejected the U.S. offer, calling it ``terribly unbecoming.'' He blamed the industrialized countries for exploiting developing countries through colonization and leaving them vulnerable to the consequences of the excesses of the wealthy countries. ``This plague of climate change _ they caused it,'' Daura said. Outside, protesters stood in pouring rain and set off earsplitting alarms that were audible inside the conference hall. ``Don't Let Us D(r)own!'' read one banner. Security was stepped up at the conference hall after the U.S. negotiator was hit in the face with a cream pie hurled by a a protester Wednesday night.

Two bombs exploded in a suburb of Haiti's capital Thursday, killing a 7-year-old girl on her way to school and injuring two other people in a second day of violence ahead of weekend elections. The bombs exploded in two separate locations in suburban Carrefour, the private Radio Metropole reported. Police defused a third bomb found on the ground across the street from the Organization of American States headquarters in the upscale neighborhood of Petionville. Violence has cast a shadow over Sunday's presidential election, which is expected to be won by former President Jean-Bertrand Aristide. Seven bombs exploded Wednesday, killing a teen-age boy and injuring at least 14 on busy streets in and around Port-au-Prince. The name of the girl killed Thursday was not immediately available. Protesters enraged by her death set up flaming tire barricades to block Carrefour Road, one of the capital's main thoroughfares. Fearing for the safety of their students, many school principals have canceled classes until Tuesday. American Airlines canceled flights Sunday and Monday ``due to civil unrest surrounding the elections,'' according to an airline reservations agent who would not give her name. Air France also called off flights, the French Embassy said, and the Haitian Red Cross suspended its nighttime ambulance service after an attack on one of its vehicles. Main opposition parties have boycotted the race, charging that local and legislative elections earlier this year were rigged by the government in favor of Aristide's Lavalas Family party, which won more than 80 percent of the seats. Aristide's Lavalas Family party and opposition spokesmen have accused each other of being responsible for the recent surge of violence.

Retired navy officers on Thursday objected to suggestions that the Russian nuclear submarine Kursk sank because it collided with another vessel, saying that such a crash would not have caused catastrophic damage. ``There could have been a collision, but it wouldn't have led to such tragic consequences,'' retired Adm. Eduard Baltin said at a conference organized by the newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda. He said a crash probably would have dented the submarine's outer hull but would not have crippled it. The Kursk, ripped apart by a pair of massive explosions, sank to the bottom of the Barents Sea, killing all 118 men aboard. Russian officials _ including Deputy Prime Minister Ilya Klebanov _ have said a collision was the most likely cause of the Aug. 12 sinking. But Baltin and other former navy officers recalled numerous collisions between Russian and Western submarines stalking each other during the Cold War. The vessels always lumbered back to base and were back in service after minor repairs, the former officers said. A government commission hasn't determined the cause of the disaster. Some experts have suggested a torpedo exploded in the ship's weapons bay. Others have said the explosion could have been caused by a World War II-era mine or an internal malfunction. But government officials have repeatedly said they believe a collision was the mostly likely explanation. Northern Fleet chief Adm. Vyacheslav Popov said this week that a foreign vessel emitted SOS signals in the sinking area shortly after the disaster. The Russian Navy has searched the seabed for debris that could have been left by a collision but has not reported finding any. The United States and Great Britain operate submarines in the Barents Sea and had vessels monitoring the Russian naval exercises when the Kursk sank, but both countries have denied their boats were involved in the accident. The retired submariners also dismissed the mine theory, saying such World War II ordnance would have caused only light damage to the state-of-the-art vessel. The officers said a fire in the torpedo compartment was a possibility but insisted it would not have triggered an explosion. They said the disaster was likely caused by a combination of several external and internal factors, but they wouldn't describe them, saying the information is classified and they fear arrest by the Federal Security Service. Some media reports have suggested that the Kursk was testing a new torpedo system that uses a liquid fuel propulsion system, which some sailors consider unstable. That could have exploded spontaneously, but Klebanov has denied the submarine had such weapons aboard.

The United States has deadlocked with European nations on how to combat global warming. With only hours left to reach a deal as the massive climate conference in the Netherlands concludes tomorrow, both sides have now rejected a last minute compromise offered by the conference Chairman. The BBC's Tim Hersh is at the meeting at The Hague. Tim, can you explain why the American and European negotiators can't agree. Well, they come from very widely diverging positions on some of the key issues about the rules by which the targets on reducing green house gas emissions can be cut. What the Americans say is they have a huge task in meeting that target because the emissions have grown with the economy, since 1990 the baseline from which these cuts are supposed to follow. Which means that to get down to minus 7 percent between 1990 and 2010 is a huge task for them. In order to do that, they say they have to find the most cost-effective way of achieving those cuts. That means buying, effectively paying for those cuts in many cases to happen overseas. Now that and some of the other complex rules the Europeans believe is a kind of loophole. They say that the United States is in effect trying to evade its responsibility to clean up its own society. So what is the problem then with this compromise proposal that was offered by the conference Chairman? The problem is it is right in the middle and since the negotiating positions are quite wide apart, neither side wants to go all that way to get to that middle ground. So if the conference does not produce some kind of an agreement tomorrow, then what happens to the Kyoto Protocol and that is the protocol that says that emissions must be cut in industrialized nations to just over 5 percent below 1990 levels. What happens to that if there is no agreement? Does it fall by the wayside? It makes it extremely difficult for it really to be meaningful because the problem is that the targets agreed at Kyoto only reach until this period between 2008 and 2012. We are not really far off it. So that if we don't at this stage even have the shape of a deal which can then in the case of the United States go back to the Senate for possible ratification, it's leaving it so late that there is very little prospect that those targets can be met. How is the United States coming off in this conference now? In the beginning it was considered anything but environmentally friendly. I understand that one of the heads of the American delegation took a 'pie in the face' at some point. How does the US look at this point? Well, to be honest, at all of these conferences there is a tendency for the US to be seen as the bad guy, mainly really just down to the fact that about 25 percent of the world's green house gas emissions come from the United States, even though of course they only have something like 4 or 5 percent of the world's population. The stakes, of course, are that much higher for the US precisely for the reasons that I outlined earlier. They say that it's not fair to treat them as the bad guy. They have in their view begun to decouple that link between economic growth and the rise in CO2 emissions, but I'm afraid from America's point of view they are generally not the popular party here. The BBC's Tim Hersh speaking to us from The Hague. Thank you very much, tim. Your welcome.

A special investigator has asked the attorney general's office to launch a criminal investigation of former President Alberto Fujimori for possible corruption. Jose Ugaz _ whom Fujimori himself appointed to investigate his former spy chief Vladimiro Montesinos _ said Friday that he filed the request a day before with Attorney General Nelly Calderon. In a news conference, Ugaz said the request covered a range of possible crimes, including money laundering, corruption of public officials and illicit enrichment during Fujimori's 10-year autocratic reign. Fujimori, 62, resigned as president Monday while in Japan and said he plans to stay there, his native land, indefinitely. His downfall was started by a corruption scandal surrounding his close ally, Montesinos, who appeared in a video apparently bribing an opposition congressman. The investigation request came amid allegations that Fujimori ordered a Government Palace legal aide to pose as a prosecutor and authorize police to carry out a Nov. 7 raid at Montesinos' apartment. Dozens of suitcases and boxes _ stuffed with documents, videotapes and other evidence related to the corruption case _ were taken from the apartment and delivered to the presidential palace, instead of to judicial authorities. During the raid, Fujimori, with a six-vehicle escort and pursued by reporters, led a bizarre and fruitless hunt for Montesinos in a resort town near Lima. Montesinos was widely thought to be protected by his allies in the military. Fujimori later said he had gone to ``breathe ocean air.'' But some have speculated the late-night ride was a diversion while police recovered incriminating evidence that Montesinos was rumored to be holding over the former president's head. National Police Gen. Federico Hurtado, accused of abuse of authority, testified Thursday in a military court that Fujimori presented him with the phony prosecutor and ordered the raid be carried out. ``President Fujimori plotted the entire operation, which I consider perverse,'' Hurtado told reporters Friday. ``All of us who participated in the operation were vilely tricked.'' Ugaz said his investigators received an anonymous tip that Fujimori had met with lawyers in Singapore last week on his way to Tokyo to arrange for the liquidation of two front companies and transfer $18 million to three bank accounts in Japan. This week, Ugaz asked Calderon's office to coordinate with Singaporean and Japanese authorities to investigate, he said. Fujimori has denied he received any money from the alleged transfers. Meanwhile, an official at Japan's Justice Ministry's Civil Affairs Bureau, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Friday that Fujimori may be eligible to stay permanently because of his Japanese ancestry. Japan has no extradition treaty with Peru. Refusing to accept his resignation, Peru's Congress on Tuesday dismissed Fujimori for ``moral unfitness.'' Congress President Valentin Paniagua was sworn in Wednesday as interim president, until a new president takes office in July after elections in April. Montesinos, who remains at large, faces criminal complaints ranging from directing death squads and torture to influence peddling and skimming profits from narcotics traffickers. Fujimori, known as an iron-fisted leader, won a third five-year term in May, in an election marred by fraud allegations.

When a U.S. guided missile destroyer sailed into Aden six weeks ago, the Pentagon in effect was taking a conscious risk _ making use of the best natural harbor on the Arabian peninsula but depending for the ship's safety on a government that relies on the uncertain loyalties of army officers, Muslim clerics and tribal leaders with long-standing links to armed Islamic militant groups. So far, FBI officials investigating the suicide bombing of the Cole on Oct. 12, in which 17 U.S. sailors were killed and 39 injured, say they have no evidence that anybody at any official level participated in the bombing, beyond the low-level suspects already arrested by President Ali Abdullah Saleh's security police for issuing false documents and helping with other logistics. But from the beginning, FBI agents have kept open an alternate possibility _ that the attack may have involved powerful figures inside Yemen who have close ties with Osama bin Laden, the FBI's most-wanted terrorist. In the face of vigorous Yemeni denials, the FBI has wanted to know whether any part of the Cole bombing was supported from within the government, or by powerful men with Islamic-militant credentials who live under official protection. From a base in Afghanistan, bin Laden, 43-year-old son of a Yemeni-born Saudi Arabian construction billionaire, reached out to Yemen for thousands of recruits for his ``holy war,'' first against Soviet troops in Afghanistan, later against U.S. troops in the Arabian Peninsula and the Persian Gulf. Along the way, he met men now prominent in San`a, the Yemeni capital, including a top army commander, the country's most militant Muslim cleric, and a prominent tribal leader. Western intelligence reports say he gave them money to send Yemeni recruits to Afghanistan, and back to Yemen when the Afghan struggle ended. These so-called Arab Afghans _ about 3,000 Yemenis, and perhaps twice as many non-Yemeni Arabs, including Algerians, Egyptians, Iraqis, Jordanians, Somalis, Sudanese and Syrians _ were then enlisted in terrorist attacks aimed at communists who had run a separate Yemeni state from Aden between 1967 and 1990, when the two Yemens merged under Saleh, the San`a ruler. This pact culminated in a 1994 civil war. Saleh finally defeated the communists, using large numbers of Arab Afghans formed into Islamic terrorist units as his shock troops, and then rewarding their service and buying their further loyalty by bringing them into the ``big tent'' of his disparate government. The FBI's concern over possible links to the Cole bombing appears to have grown as the Yemeni investigation of the bombing has progressed. The Yemenis, denying the FBI direct access to interrogations and other key aspects of their inquiry, say that their investigation is nearly complete, that it shows that two bearded men who attacked the Cole in a fiberglass skiff were Saudi Arabian-born Yemenis, like bin Laden, and that the most useful leads in the case now lie outside Yemen. In the last week, the FBI's concerns were heightened by the government's decision to open a trial, probably in January, of half a dozen key suspects, mostly Arab Afghans who had low-level government jobs. U.S. officials say an early trial, based on evidence that the Yemenis say links the bombers to bin Laden's network but not to anybody at senior levels in Yemen, could obscure more than it reveals. The U.S. officials draw parallels with the Saudi investigation into the 1996 truck-bombing of the Khobar Towers military barracks outside Dhahran, which killed 19 U.S. servicemen. Saudi officials prevented the FBI from questioning any suspects and eventually held a trial, executing the alleged conspirators without giving the Americans any access. But the Khobar Towers analogy, and the mere suggestion that prominent Yemenis might have connived in the Cole bombing has enraged the Yemenis. Last week, Prime Minister Abdul-Karim al-Iryani, a Yale-educated biogeneticist, called an American reporter and denied any suggestion of a cover-up. Throughout his tenure, al-Iryani has been caught in a political crossfire resulting from his government's desire for improved relations with the United States _ as evidenced by the agreement on Navy ships refueling in Yemen _ and its desire not to provoke influential Yemenis who are militantly anti-American. Over the fierce resistance of Yemeni secret police, the prime minister has been negotiating with the U.S. ambassador, Barbara K. Bodine, for better FBI access to the Yemeni probe, including the right to have FBI agents watch Yemeni interrogations through a one-way mirror or a live television relay. Until now, all the FBI has seen of the interrogations has been edited transcripts. In the telephone call, al-Iryani reiterated that ``it is nonsense, absolute nonsense'' to suggest that some of bin Laden's old allies in San`a could have played a part in the bombing of the Cole. Referring to the Arab Afghans who settled into Yemen's remote mountains and deserts in the early 1990s as jihadis, or holy warriors, he said they had been contained since joining the government. ``Yes, these jihadis have helped us during the secessionist war, and yes, we decided that they must be absorbed into the government system afterwards and not let loose to cause trouble,'' he said. But that did not translate into high-level Yemeni connivance in the Cole bombing, the prime minister added. ``On the contrary, nobody who planned this attack could conceivably have consulted with high officials, for the simple reason that they would have known that anyone who did would have been arrested immediately,'' he said. What anybody makes of all this depends, in part, on the assessment of Saleh, one of the Arab world's longest-surviving leaders, and his policy of reaching out to Islamic militants, rather than jailing and executing them, as has happened in Egypt, Jordan and other Arab states. Although the policy raises debate elsewhere in the Arab world, it is at least to some extent an outgrowth of Saleh's own turbulent political past and the Yemeni elite's history of assassination and betrayal. Saleh, then an obscure army officer, became president after an army officers' coup in which one Yemeni president, Ibrahim al-Hamdi, was shot dead in 1977, and a second coup eight months later in which al-Hamdi's successor, Ahmad al-Ghashmi, a close ally of Saleh, was killed by an agent of the Aden communists with a suitcase bomb. That Saleh, 59, is still president 22 years later, despite assassination attempts, his aides suggest, is partly because he reached out to potential enemies, rewarding any who stepped into his ``big tent'' with government protection and salaries. But the corollary is that Saleh has made allies, or at least beneficiaries, of men with lurid pasts, especially the Arab Afghans. This paid off for him when Islamic militant groups allied with his forces and entered Aden on June 21, 1994, finally reuniting Yemen after centuries of division, while killing at least 10,000 civilians in the process, according to Western human rights reports. Years later, the result is that the capital has become a hive of political, ideological and religious contradictions that were bound to intrigue U.S. officials investigating the Cole bombing. One of the most powerful expressions of this complex situation was that by the time Saleh negotiated the agreement allowing U.S. warships to refuel in Aden, two of the most powerful people in the capital, after Saleh himself, were one-time allies of bin Laden. U.S. intelligence reports say both these men traveled to Afghanistan in the 1980s to meet bin Laden, and helped recruit militants from across the Muslim world for the Afghan struggle. One of them is Saleh's half brother, Ali Mohsen al-Ahmar, a high-ranking army general who is said to have presidential ambitions himself. Some rivals attribute to Ahmar, a burly man in his early 50s, an unsavory record, including the financing of militant Islamic groups. Before the 1994 war, some Yemeni officials and Western intelligence reports say, the general was in charge of $20 million supplied by bin Laden to help settle Arab Afghan fighters in Yemen. Later, as Saleh's military commander in Southern Yemen, he oversaw the deployment of the Islamic groups in the climactic battle for the city. More recently, according to some Yemeni reports, he may have been unsettled by Saleh's decision to appoint as head of his presidential guard _ and heir presumptive _ his son Ahmed Ali Abdullah Saleh, an army officer in his mid-30s. Yemeni officials say the general retains strong links to his past involvement with the Arab Afghan network in Yemen, through his marriage to a sister of a prominent tribal leader, Tariq Nasr al-Fadhli, one of the leading Afghan war veterans living on a government stipend in San`a. Son of one of the most powerful sultans in southern Yemen during the British colonial era, al-Fadhli, in his mid-40s, is said by Yemeni and U.S. officials to have met bin Laden in Saudi exile in the 1980s and to have fought under him in Afghanistan. Now he is a member of the presidential council, a largely symbolic advisory body to Saleh. Later, he returned to Yemen as leader of one of the most active Islamic terrorist groups. The FBI files say he was the point man in the botched December 1992 bombings of two Aden hotels that were billeting more than 100 U.S. troops en route to Somalia. Those bombings _ also directed by bin Laden, the FBI contends _ failed to kill any Americans only because a detonator went off prematurely, disabling a huge truck bomb. The man believed to have driven the truck, and to have lost his hand when the detonator exploded, Jamal al-Nahdi, is said by U.S. officials to be living in San`a as a businessman. Another prominent figure with long-standing ties to Islamic terrorist groups is a militantly anti-American cleric, Abdel Meguid al-Zindani. In his late 60s, al-Zindani heads a San`a theological school, the University of Faith, a beneficiary of government financial aid, where for years thousands of students from across north Africa and the Middle East have been immersed in the militant Salafi form of Islam that has inspired many militant Islamic organizations, including the Armed Islamic Group in Algeria that stands accused of brutal massacres of Algerian villagers. What any of these men think of the attack on the Cole is not known. From the day of the bombing, the Saleh government has contrived to deny Western reporters free access, watching carefully where they go and whom they see. The only senior government officials authorized to speak about the Cole bombing have been Saleh and al-Iryani. Al-Iryani, asked about Mohsen and al-Fadhli, said both men had permanently severed their ties with the Arab Afghan network. Meanwhile, the questions posed by the Cole bombing have carried U.S. officials back to calculations made before the warship-refueling program began. Then, officials like Bodine, the U.S. ambassador, had to explain to the Pentagon why it made sense to bring warships into a country that the State Department itself had described as ``a safe haven for terrorist groups,'' or to trust a government that had espoused some sharply anti-American policies _ for example, supporting Saddam Hussein in his 1990 invasion of Kuwait. The argument that prevailed in Washington was that the Saleh government was changing, and that it had taken important steps to curb Islamic terrorist groups still based in the remote parts of the country. This is al-Iryani's contention, and it has strong support from U.S. officials here, who say they believe that Saleh would like to curb the Arab Afghans once and for all. Yet even Americans who pushed hardest for the refueling agreement now question whether the only assistance the Cole bombers had from Yemenis came from a handful of lower-level officials. ``It was much more complicated than that, and required a lot of help from inside the country,'' a senior U.S. official said. ``As for who gave that help, that's like trying to sort out the tentacles of an octopus.''

The billboards declaring the inevitable went up even before the first vote had been cast. They boast a huge photograph of former President Jean-Bertrand Aristide with the simple and foregone declaration in Creole: ``Feb. 7, 2001. Peace in the Head. Peace in the Belly.'' The date refers to the presidential inauguration that, depending on one's point of view, is seen as Aristide's appointment with destiny or infamy. He is the only real candidate in Sunday's presidential election, because almost all opposition political parties, civic groups and international observers are sitting out the contest after flawed vote-counting in May's legislative elections gave Aristide's Lavalas Party an overwhelming majority in the Parliament. The peace proclaimed from the billboards has been scarce in recent weeks. At least 11 pipe bombs have exploded, killing two people, including a 7-year-old girl. The streets of Port-au-Prince were quieter and emptier than usual Saturday morning, as many people left town or closed their businesses early just in case there was unrest. Throughout the night, black-clad riot police with assault rifles patrolled; residents of poorer areas improvised roadblocks from concrete, logs or twisted car chassis. ``Peace in the belly'' has been elusive in recent years, since the economic morass fostered by meager investment and withheld foreign aid made life harder for this nation's impoverished masses. In the poorest neighborhoods, where Aristide is regarded as a savior whose previous attempt at leading Haiti to progress was cut short by a 1991 coup, there is palpable excitement at mere mention of his name. In the neighborhood of Bel-Air on Friday afternoon, several hundred people gathered for a Lavalas rally broke into smiles and cheers when they heard that Aristide was to pass by, a rare event in what has been a noncampaign with almost no public appearances. A joyous noise erupted when Aristide's convoy of Jeeps did indeed speed past. Earlier, a plane had flown overhead dropping fliers with his photograph (the plane later crashed, seriously injuring the pilot). In a whirlwind afternoon, Aristide's motorcade went through several neighborhoods, stopping only briefly so he could console the parents of the little girl killed in a pipe bomb explosion on Thursday. ``It does not matter that there was no campaign, because the day Aristide left the palace his campaign was already done,'' said Abondoit Cazeneve, a Lavalas supporter. ``The opposition and the international community do not like Third World countries to change. That is how they make their money.'' Earlier on Friday, Aristide appeared on television and radio to urge people to shed their fears and cast their vote. His entreaties echoed the promise of another Lavalas billboard, the one reading ``Security'' just down the street from heavily armed police officers guarding the offices of the Provisional Electoral Council. ``Sunday Nov. 26, all of us, brave women and men who want peace in our minds, and peace in our stomachs, will not hide in the caverns of fear,'' Aristide said. Lavalas supporters at the Bel-Air rally got the message. ``The people who do not want the elections to happen attack us,'' said Ulrich Jean-Lestel. ``We believe we will have peace.'' Aristide's presumed victory has left many of Haiti's elite aghast and unwilling to participate as either observers or voters. Friday night, several dozen professional people attended a book signing at a gleaming auto showroom in the suburbs. ``In a country without a tradition of tolerance or democracy, this sham of an election in no way will help this country move toward institutions and democracy,'' said one civic leader. ``The biggest harm he is doing to the country is the way he is reaching power.'' Among the guests were several former government ministers, including a few who had worked under Aristide. They wondered if he would ever be able to attract people like themselves, who returned to Haiti with advanced degrees and hope. ``More and more elites should come together and share their vision, to build a team with good economic policies to get out of this economic and social crisis,'' said Rosny Desroches, the president of the Haitian Foundation for Public Education. ``I know some are working on that already. If Aristide becomes president, they will have to play a role as a counterpower, because we can no longer say we have a Parliament.'' Behind him, people waited in line to have their books signed. The slim tome, titled ``Vision or Illusion'' was about the role of the elite in Haiti. It opened with a quote from Voltaire. ``One day all will be well, here is our hope,'' it read. ``Everything is well today, there is our illusion.''

A characteristically defiant Slobodan Milosevic staged his political comeback Saturday, winning re-election as leader of his Socialist Party of Serbia and denouncing as a coup the popular uprising that swept him from power last month. In his first public appearance since he accepted his election defeat and resigned as the Yugoslav president on Oct. 6, a day after the uprising, Milosevic gave an aggressive opening speech to the Socialist Party congress. ``Everybody in this hall knows what kind of violence and lawlessness has taken place since the coup on October 5,'' he said. ``The situation is absurd. ``The biggest defender of the state and national interests is the Socialist Party of Serbia, and that's why the party is the main target of the attacks,'' he said to long applause. The party congress was closed to the news media, but film and text of his speech were released to news agencies and foreign reporters outside the congress hall. Milosevic, who exuded confidence as he re-emerged from self-imposed seclusion Saturday, won 86.55 percent of the votes cast by more than 2,000 delegates at the party congress, according to Zoran Nikolic, a co-justice minister in the transitional government of Serbia and a senior party member. Saturday's congress was called after the Socialists' resounding defeat in local elections and Milosevic's failure in the race for Yugoslav president on Sept. 24. It falls just a month ahead of Dec. 23 legislative elections in Serbia, where real power lies in the Yugoslav federation. There has been, leading Socialists said, some fierce internal criticism of Milosevic. But the man who led Serbia into three lost wars and bequeathed his successors a ruined economy was the only candidate proposed for president of a party that he built 10 years ago from the ruins of the League of Communists, which ran Yugoslavia for 45 years after World War II. This week, Milosevic was shown twice on television urging party officials to unite for the December elections, signaling his determination to continue _ despite his indictment for war crimes _ to be a force in Serbian politics. On Saturday, Milosevic referred to the International War Crimes Tribunal, which indicted him for suspected atrocities committed by his security forces in Kosovo last year, as ``the new Gestapo in The Hague.'' ``A part of the international community accused Serbs of genocide against Albanians,'' he said, in clear reference to the Hague tribunal. He countered by referring to the alleged persecution of minority Kosovo Serbs in the 1980s, and the persecution and killings they have suffered since NATO troops entered Kosovo in June 1999 when Milosevic's Serbian forces withdrew. ``Genocide was carried out against the Serbs by that part of the international community,'' he said. The estimated 100,000 Serbs who remain in Kosovo today ``are the greatest sufferers of the end of the century, maybe even at this moment the greatest heroes in the world,'' he told the congress, according to the text of his remarks. Rival candidates for the party leadership were discussed, said Zoran Andjelkovic, the new general secretary of the Socialists, but of the seven people nominated, six refused to run, and one of them quit the party. Milosevic attended four party meetings to prepare for the congress, Andjelkovic said, adding: ``He is feeling pretty fresh. He's not been doing anything lately.'' Party officials insist that Milosevic remains popular among the rank and file of the 700,000-member Socialists. ``His role in founding and building this party and sustaining it for so long is enormous,'' said Zarko Obradovic, one of 37 members of the party's executive board. ``It is an undisputed fact that Mr. Milosevic is one of the greatest leaders in this area, and people are members of the party because of him.'' In the Sept. 24 presidential election, Milosevic won 30 percent of the vote, compared with just over 50 percent for Vojislav Kostunica, the candidate of the Democratic Opposition of Serbia. Opinion polls now show the Socialist Party with about 10 percent of popular support. Milosevic's personal rating is slipping even lower. Zoran Lilic, a former president of Serbia and senior Socialist who quit to establish a rival party last month, said before the congress that Milosevic saw the gathering as his ticket to political survival. ``He was really shaken after Oct. 5, but then he realized that he had not played all his aces, and he still has some in his hand: that is the party,'' Lilic said. ``He is destroying the SPS to protect himself.'' Lilic had predicted the party's leadership election would be rigged: ``I know how things were done,'' he said. On Saturday, Milosevic denounced top Socialists who had left the party as ``self-serving cowards,'' solely motivated by a desire for power. Borisav Jovic, a former deputy to Milosevic who this week split away to found yet another rival party, said he had still hoped for ``extraordinary personnel changes'' and a switch from ``the misguided policies'' _ in particular, the move by Milosevic to give power to members of the Yugoslav Left, the party of his wife, Mirjana Markovic. Other reasons for conflict with the Socialist Party, Jovic said, were the ``totally unnecessary'' argument with Serbia's sister republic, Montenegro, which threatens Yugoslavia's very existence, and the effort to manipulate the September election result, which risked bringing violent revolt to Serbia. ``To lead the country in this way is impossible, and the membership just does not accept that,'' Jovic said.

an important international conference aimed at combating global warming collapsed today with no agreement on how to proceed. nbc's jim maceda has our report. after two weeks of talks and a 12-hour marathon session, one delegate stormed out of the conference with bad news -- no progress in tackling the problem of global warming. they're no longer negotiating, not prepared to do anymore. it's the end. the meeting is suspended. the end, for now, of any hope of committing to cuts in carbon dioxide emissions worldwide. responsible, say many scientists, for the "greenhouse" effect warming the earth, melting the icecaps, and behind the rise in "extreme weather," from tornadoes in america to landslides in italy from draughts in africa to flooding in australia. but today, some european countries rejected a compromise that would have allowed the u.s. big loopholes in cutting its greenhouse gas emissions over the next ten years. so no deal, and environmentalists are outraged. i think this is an absolute disaster for the climate. the american negotiator took a pie in the face from an angry protester. this week, many blame the u.s. for cheating on its target cuts. let's not play the blame game and say the u.s. is totally at fault. that simply is wrong. delegates hope a new round of talks next year will succeed, with al gore, who supports the curbs as the u.s. president. george w. bush, however, opposes negotiations to cut heat trapping emissions. he doesn't seem to accept that climate change is a problem. in great britain alone, almost $1 billion in flood damage this fall, the worst weather seen in over a century. today's failure, the latest missed opportunity, say environmentalists, to stem the effects of global warming, they warn, will only get worse. jim maceda, nbc news,

The United Nations Climate Change Conference in The Hague has ended in an impasse after two weeks of intense negotiations. Delegates from 180 countries were unable to agree on how to cut greenhouse gas emissions, which many believe causes global warming. Lisa Schline has been monitoring developments from the United Nations Headquarters in Geneva. The delegates were close to an agreement, but in the end a feud between the European Union and the United States caused its unravel. They disagreed over how targeted cuts in greenhouse gas emissions could be achieved. Under the Kyoto Protocol, 38 developed countries have to reduce emissions by more than 5% over the next 10 years. The United States, which is the world's biggest polluter, wants to reach its target in large part by counting so called carbon sinks against its emissions quota. The United States argued that it has many rich forests and will plant new trees to help absorb carbon from the atmosphere as a means of cutting its emissions. The EU rejected this proposal as self-serving. Environmentalists have reacted to the failure with dismay. Lisa Schline for VOA News, Geneva.

A fire caused a stampede in a garment factory killing at least 45 people, many of them women and children, at an industrial town near Bangladesh's capital, Dhaka, police and hospital doctors said Sunday. More than 100 others were hospitalized with injuries after the fire and stampede Saturday night at Chowdhury Knitwear Garments factory, a four-story building at Shibpur in Narsingdi district, 25 miles east of Dhaka. The death toll could rise as some of the injured people were in critical condition, a police official supervising the rescue work said. At least 900 workers, many of them women, were working at the factory when a fire broke out on the its fourth floor, where towels and knitwear are ironed. In panic, the workers scrambled to exit the factory through its narrow stairs and many of them fell on each other. The only exit door of the factory on the ground floors was reportedly locked for security reason preventing the fleeing workers from leaving the factory. Hundreds of local people joined firefighters to break open the locked gates and rescue victims.

The White House says President Clinton will review all pending requests for executive clemency before he leaves office in January, including that of Leonard Peltier, the American Indian activist convicted of murdering two FBI agents in South Dakota. The president ``will focus on all of the clemency cases after the election and that will be one of them,'' White House spokesman Daniel Cruise said Sunday. Also Sunday, the White House released the transcript of Clinton's Nov. 7 interview with radio station WBAI-FM in New York City in which the president was asked about the Peltier case. Clinton said then that he would review all clemency applications ``and see what the merits dictate ... based on the evidence.'' Asked specifically about Peltier, Clinton said he has ``never had time actually to sit down myself and review that case.'' ``I know it's very important to a lot of people, maybe on both sides of the issue,'' he said. ``And I think I owe it to them to give it an honest look-see.'' On June 26, 1975, FBI agents Ronald A. Williams and Jack R. Coler pursued a robbery suspect into the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota. A shootout erupted with activists from the American Indian Movement. Two suspects were acquitted and a third freed for lack of evidence. Peltier, after fleeing to Canada and being extradited to the United States, was convicted and sentenced to consecutive life terms in 1977, despite defense claims that evidence against him had been falsified. Peltier, 56, is serving the terms at the U.S. Penitentiary in Leavenworth, Kan. He has suffered from health problems in recent years. In June, a parole examiner recommended that Peltier's sentences be continued until his next full parole hearing in 2008. ___ Leonard Peltier Defense Committee http://www.freepeltier.org No Parole Peltier Association http://www.noparolepeltier.com

A former communist who said he would slow Romania's move toward a Western-style market economy emerged strongest Sunday in presidential elections, while his party did best in the race for parliament, exit polls showed. Ion Iliescu, a past president, was leading with 36.5 percent of the vote, exit polls from Sunday's presidential and parliamentary elections showed. Ultranationalist Corneliu Vadim Tudor was second with 27.9 percent, the polls indicated. The results were based on 23,000 people questioned as they finished voting. They were conducted by the IMAS polling institute. They also showed Iliescu's Social Democracy Party with 39.6 percent in the bicameral parliament and Tudor's Greater Romania Party second with 22.5 percent. With no candidate capturing at least 50 percent of the total 17.7 million votes possible, the two best placers will advance to a presidential runoff Dec. 10. Partial official results will not be available before Wednesday, and final results will be released in early December, said Leonida Pastor, chairman of the central electoral bureau. If victorious in parliament, Iliescu's party will have to find a coalition partner. Tudor's party is an unlikely candidate since the two top contenders are political rivals. Senior Western diplomats said they had been told it would likely be the center-left Liberals, given 10.5 percent by the IMAS poll. Iliescu's strong showing indicated widespread disenchantment with the incumbent, President Emil Constantinescu, and the centrist five-party coalition. During a tenure marked by political bickering and corruption, poverty has increased and Romania has failed to move closer to joining the European Union and NATO, two organizations Romania equates with acceptance into the ranks of the prosperous West. Constantinescu said he had failed in his bid to battle corruption, and therefore did not run for re-election. His Christian Democrats did not even get the required votes to win any seats in parliament, nor did the Peasant Party, which supported Constantinescu during his presidency. Mugur Isarescu, Constantinescu's prime minister who also ran for president, got 10.2 percent according to IMAS. Iliescu, who accuses the ruling coalition of ruining the economy, has questioned the wisdom of privatization at any cost and has promised a ``dignified'' _ meaning slower _ entry into the EU and NATO. On Sunday, Iliescu sought to reassure his opponents, pledging to ``relaunch the economy, to return to economic growth, to rebuild the state and to accelerate our joining the European Union and NATO.'' In a message clearly directed at the nationalist Tudor, he said ``those who think we can find solutions to our many problems ... through extremist or xenophobic slogans alien to democracy are mistaken.'' Active in politics since the mid-1950s, the 70-year-old Iliescu broke with Communist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu in the 1970s and rose against him in 1989, leading the revolution that led to Ceausescu's ouster and execution. He downplayed his past as a communist, emphasizing instead his leading role in overthrowing Ceausescu in the revolution that ended more than four decades of communist rule. Tudor, 50, an extremist known for criticizing Gypsies, Jews and other minorities, is unlikely to win in a runoff. He sought to allay moderates' fears on Sunday, promising that ``there won't be a dictatorship. Don't be afraid.'' Over the past few months, Tudor _ who curried Ceausescu's favor by writing poems praising the dictator _ has toned down racist and anti-Semitic statements. The average salary here is just $100 a month, and inflation is expected to hit 40 percent this year. Unemployment stands at 11 percent. Sixty-four parties were vying for seats in the 486-seat legislature and 12 candidates were running for president.

Leftists will likely return to power in Romania after weekend elections, with an ex-communist leading in the race for the presidency and his party gaining the most support in parliament, partial results showed Monday. With 57 percent of votes counted, ex-communist Ion Iliescu, president from 1990 to 1996, was in first place with 36.5 percent, and extreme nationalist Corneliu Vadim Tudor was second with 29.09 percent, the central election bureau said. In the race for parliament, Iliescu's Social Democracy Party had nearly 38 percent, while Tudor's Greater Romania Party had just over 21 percent, the central election bureau said. Five parties secured the threshold needed to enter parliament. With none of a dozen presidential candidates capturing 50 percent of the total 17.7 million votes, Iliescu and Tudor will face each other in a runoff Dec. 10. Despite isolated reports of irregularities, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which monitored the voting, said the elections were ``transparent, free, fair and equal.'' The strong showing by Iliescu and Tudor was due to widespread disappointment with the incumbent, President Emil Constantinescu, and the centrist five-party government coalition. Constantinescu did not run Sunday, citing his failure to curb corruption. Mihail Diaconu, a 64-year-old teacher, said he voted for Tudor because he wasn't involved ``in the banditry and crookedness of the former governments.'' There were concerns in and out of Romania that the strong showing by leftists and nationalists could deter foreign investors and harm the country's chances of joining the European Union and NATO. In a statement, the U.S. Embassy suggested it expected Western-style reforms to continue, including the adoption of economic reforms and the privatization of state-owned enterprises. A headline in the daily Adevarul reflected the feelings of many who did not vote for either Iliescu or Tudor, opting instead for other candidates more accepted by the West. ``The last in Europe,'' it said. ``In November 2000 we are the only case in Central and Eastern Europe where economic reforms have not succeeded ... and the ascension of the Greater Romania Party will raise great questions in the West about the success of political reforms.'' The ruling coalition's tenure has been characterized by political feuding and corruption, and has seen poverty grow while the country failed to move toward joining the European Union and NATO _ two organizations Romania equates with acceptance into the ranks of the prosperous West. The average monthly salary in Romania is $100. Inflation is expected to hit 40 percent this year, while unemployment is 11 percent. Iliescu's leftist Party of Social Democracy is expected to form a coalition government, most likely with the left-center Liberal Party, which received 10.5 percent in the exit poll. After Iliescu's election success had become clear Sunday, he sought to reassure his opponents, promising to ``relaunch the economy, to return to economic growth, to rebuild the state, and to accelerate our joining the European Union and NATO.'' In a message clearly aimed at the nationalist Tudor, he said ``those who think we can find solutions to our many problems ... through extremist or xenophobic slogans alien to democracy are mistaken.'' Tudor _ a 50-year-old extremist known for criticism of Gypsies, Jews and other minorities _ was unlikely to win in a runoff against the 70-year-old Iliescu.

Emerging as the apparent winner in Haiti's presidential election, Jean-Bertrand Aristide on Monday ended six years of seclusion and publically denied opposition claims that he would squelch democracy. Becoming yet another Haitian dictator ``is not on my agenda,'' he said. Apparently dismissing the opposition boycott of Sunday's vote, Aristide said his political opponents would be welcome in his Cabinet. ``There will be a place for everyone in my government,'' Aristide said at his first news conference since 1994. ``To have a peaceful Haiti, the opposition is indispensable ... It is part of our democratic fate.'' Aristide, the fiery former priest who was Haiti's first freely elected president in 1990, did not explicitly declare victory in the vote, but he spoke as if he had been declared president. A preliminary result is expected Tuesday. Opposition parties that boycotted the presidential vote, meanwhile, claimed that Aristide has no mandate to govern because most Haitians did not vote and charged that ballot boxes were stuffed Sunday. Opposition leader Herve Denis said the coalition of all major opposition parties that urged voters to shun the polls would create ``a peaceful alternative'' to the government of Aristide and his Lavalas Family party. Denis, a former ally of Aristide, refused to elaborate. But it seemed Haiti's floundering democracy could remain locked in a fight for power that has stymied development and foreign aid and left many Haitians as poor and hungry as ever. Aristide described the election as a victory for democracy. ``We observed a huge majority of the Haitian people yesterday expressing their right through their vote,'' he said. ``I am ready to hear what the electoral council will give as a result.'' The electoral council disputed claims of a low turnout and said 60.5 percent of more than 4 million registered voters participated. In some areas, they said, every registered voter participated. ``They are hallucinating,'' Denis countered. ``The election was illegitimate. Aristide does not have a mandate to govern. The people's abstention means they refuse to be governed by Lavalas.'' Aristide confronts a mammoth task in keeping his election pledge of ``Peace of mind, peace in the belly'' in this Caribbean nation, where most of the 8 million people are unemployed and illiterate. Haiti's traditional aid donors _ the United States, France, Canada, the European Union and the Organization of American States _ have warned that a disputed presidential election could raise questions about the legitimacy of Aristide's government. Donors threatened to cut aid after a hotly disputed vote count in legislative elections in May. But in a sign the international community was prepared to give Aristide a chance, U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said Monday: ``We're glad (the elections) went ahead as planned and that there was relatively little violence.'' The U.S. State Department did not comment Monday on Aristide's apparent victory. Instead, spokesman Phillip Reeker noted the United States did not send observers because the Haitian government had not addressed ``serious irregularities'' from earlier legislative voting. The Organization of American States took a similar line and added that proceeding with the elections despite the political crisis ``does not alter the need to ensure the broad political representation and citizen participation critical to the development of Haitian democracy.'' Asked on Monday about the need for threatened international aid, Aristide said: ``You cannot want to isolate anything from the rest of the world ... I am convinced soon we will have the opportunity to address economic issues with the international community.'' And he indicated he was open to foreign investment, saying he wanted to involve every sector in bringing peace to a nation ravaged by ''200 years of economic and social violence.'' Aristide will face no opposition in the legislature, where his party was expected to make a clean sweep of nine Senate seats contested on Sunday, giving the Lavalas Family all but one seat in the Senate and 80 percent of seats in the House of Assembly. All the other seats are held by independents, with no other major political party represented. Opposition parties have boycotted the process since May, charging it was rigged to ensure Aristide's victory and one-party rule in Haiti. That made Aristide's victory inevitable, as he ran against six unknowns who were too afraid to campaign. Meanwhile, in New York, which has a large Haitian community, calls flooded in to the 24-hour Haitian radio station Radio Soleil. Station manager Ricot Dupui said most callers expressed support for Aristide. ``The general feeling is that Lavalas has been vindicated, because the international community predicted that violence would take over,'' Dupui said. Aristide, Haiti's first freely elected president, was toppled in a 1991 military coup and restored to power after a U.S.-led invasion in 1994. Forced out in 1996 by a constitutional ban on consecutive terms, he handed power to his hand-picked successor, Rene Preval.

Corneliu Vadim Tudor, a nationalist who rails against Gypsies and Jews, finished a surprising second in Romania's presidential race, putting him in a runoff against a former communist ruler. Near-final results released Tuesday from the weekend election showed Romania slipping further from the European mainstream. The two candidates in the runoff set for Dec. 10 are unlikely choices to lead Romania into membership in the European Union and NATO. Ion Iliescu, a former leading communist official who served as president from 1990 to 1996, came in first of the 12 candidates with around 37 percent of the vote. He was followed by Tudor with 29 percent _ a staggering increase over his less than 5 percent showing in 1996. Voters in the presidential and parliamentary election largely abandoned the centrist ruling coalition, which has failed to curb widespread corruption. The turn toward Iliescu reflected voters' uncertainty over the country's program of market reforms. Iliescu has promised to continue reform, but also pushed a populist message promising more social welfare and a review of the sell-off of the state sector. He first came to office after the fall of Communist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu in 1989, but his years in power were marked by stagnation and corruption. More surprising was the strong youth vote in favor of Tudor, a man who once said the country could only be run ``through the mouth of a machine gun.'' An exit poll by the IMAS institute of 23,000 people found that 33 percent of those under 35 who voted Sunday did so for Tudor. Much of Tudor's appeal reflects the general antipathy felt in Romania toward Gypsies, or Roma, believed to make up at least 1 million of the total population of almost 24 million. Tudor, 51, has promised to destroy the ``Gypsy Mafia'' as part of his general clampdown on lawlessness. ``He is charismatic,'' said Emanuela Nicolaide, 27, who owns three hotels. ``I liked his law and order message _ especially with Gypsies.'' Tudor cuts a flamboyant figure, dressed in Romanian-made white suits, lilac-tinted sunglasses and heavy gold jewelry, promoting his love of ``God and family,'' and blaming Jews, minority Hungarians and Gypsies for having led to Romania's decline over the years. He rides in a black Mercedes, but his gold Rolex is history _ or so he says. He donated it to a child under the glare of television lights last week, claiming he is the champion of the poor. His rich baritone voice can be heard in parliament denouncing ``traitors'' _ Romanians who do not think like him. Exploiting traditional Romanian suspicions of Hungary and Hungarians, he has promised to ``liquidate'' the ethnic Hungarian Party within 24 hours if he comes to power. Despite the bloodthirsty rhetoric, Ceausescu's former ``court poet'' claims to be a pacifist, declaring: ``I can't bring myself to kill a bug in the bathtub.'' ``He has a direct and incendiary message,'' said supporter Silviu Florescu, a 26-year-old philosophy graduate. A Tudor victory would likely spark a political crisis. Iliescu's Party of Social Democracy said Tuesday it would refuse to join a government with Tudor if Tudor wins the run-off. Instead, the party would try to put together a governing coalition with centrist parties, spokeswoman Corina Cretu said. ``We have to understand that we cannot let Vadim close the borders and start chasing Hungarians around the country,'' said Adrian Nastase, whom the party picked Tuesday to be prime minister if Iliescu wins. ``We need solutions to our economic and social problems, we don't need ethnic problems, violence and demagoguery.'' Lately, Tudor has backpedaled from an image he knows will get him into trouble abroad, should he become president, presiding over ``Christian suppers,'' for pensioners, and orphans. Jews, once his sworn enemies, have more lately become ``the people of the Bible.'' He is also backtracking on some of his other more extreme comments, among them the famed ``machine gun'' phrase, despite the fact that it is on record, captured on video tape. And he has toned down racist rhetoric against ethnic Hungarians and Gypsies. Still, not everyone believes him, even among the youthful electorate that generally seemed to have supported him. ``I am going to vote for Iliescu to stop him in the second round,'' said Genica Opris, a 26-year-old history graduate. ``I hope Romanians haven't lost their mind.''

Used to be, not so long ago, everyone worried about an economic collapse when a new Mexican president took office. But with the election of business-friendly Vicente Fox, who has big plans to improve what is already being touted as the healthiest, most stable Mexican economy in decades, fears this time are that the economy is growing too fast and could overheat, causing runaway inflation. Fox, who will be sworn in as president on Friday, has promised to create 1 million jobs a year, increase tax collection and social spending, and promote private investment in Mexico _ all while helping the economy continue to grow at a controlled, sustainable rate. If he accomplishes that, it would be a sharp contrast to the past four elections, which were followed by soaring inflation and unemployment that forced each new president to spend the majority of his six-year term trying get out of the hole he started off in. Many Mexicans are still trying to recover from the last crisis six years ago, when President Ernesto Zedillo was forced to devalue the peso and interest rates soared to more than 100 percent. Criticized for his handling of the crisis, Zedillo appears to have made good on his pledge to hand over a healthy economy to the next president. Fox, for his part, has promised not to mess it up. ``Under no circumstances do we want to fall into a deep hole,'' Fox promised. ``That is not going to happen this time because we are going to have a lot of communication with everyone _ with investors, with markets.'' The first opposition presidential candidate to defeat a member of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party since 1929, Fox faces the challenge of helping the economy grow enough to fulfill his promises to create jobs and raise salaries while keeping it from overheating. After the former Coca-Cola executive's election July 2, businesses and investors were giddy with excitement. The peso strengthened 4.2 percent against the dollar in three months, and it seemed Mexico's economy could do no wrong. Yet by October, nervous investors complained that his economic team was sending conflicting messages amid concern that the economy was going too strong. Trying to calm market fears, Fox's economic team announced conservative economic targets for next year, projecting that Mexico's economy will grow by up to 4.5 percent. That was a sharp drop from the more than 7 percent growth expected this year _ and which Fox had earlier pledged to continue. Fox now says he will achieve 7 percent growth by the middle of his term. But Fox has more than just investors to worry about. His plans to allow more private investment have already met strong opposition, as have many of his tax proposals. He also doesn't have a majority in either house of Congress. In addition, he faces widespread poverty. Sitting on a washed-out dirt road in Guanajuato state, where Fox recently served as governor, Cristina Saldana said she didn't vote for Fox and didn't believe he would help her family of five _ which barely survives on $31.90 a week. ``He didn't accomplish anything,'' she said bitterly. ``He's not doing anything for the poor. Everything is so expensive.'' The poor aren't the only ones looking for change. Fox was elected largely by votes from Mexico's middle class, which was hit hard when the 1994 crisis dried up bank loans and sent inflation soaring. Since then, only the super-wealthy have had access to credit, making it difficult for many to buy houses or cars, or expand small businesses. Fox has pledged to set up an antimonopoly commission and help small businesses flourish in a country where big business rules. But Fox's ideas may be too late for people like Armando Salazar, a former accountant from northern Mexico who moved to Texas after the 1994 crisis. Encouraged by the success of the North American Free Trade Agreement, which has created thousands of jobs and brought millions of dollars in foreign investment, Fox wants to work toward expanding the trade pact to allow the free movement of workers across borders. But first, he wants to increase salaries in Mexico to make them competitive with those in the United States. That's welcome news to Salazar, although he says it will take a lot before he would move back home. ``I want a salary that will support my family, allow me to live without constant stress,'' he says.

A bill passed by the lower house of the Dutch parliament set the following guidelines for carrying out euthanasia or assisted suicide: _ The physician must be convinced the patient's request is voluntary and well-considered. _ He must be convinced the patient is facing unremitting and unbearable suffering. The patient does not have to be terminally ill. _ The patient must have a correct and clear understanding of his situation and prognosis. _ The physician must reach the conclusion, together with the patient, that there is no reasonable alternative that is acceptable to the patient. The decision to die must be the patient's own. _ The physician must consult at least one other independent doctor who has examined the patient. _ He must carry out the termination of life in a medically appropriate manner.

The Dutch parliament voted Tuesday to allow doctors to provide lethal drugs to seriously ill patients who have requested to die. The bill, which is expected to become law next year, would make the Netherlands the first country to legalize mercy-killing and doctor-assisted suicide, practices that are now not legal but generally tolerated there. The legislation was approved by a 104-40 vote in the lower house of Parliament. Endorsement by the Senate is virtually assured. The Dutch action was immediately criticized by the Vatican. ``It is a very sad record for the Netherlands to become first to want to approve a law that goes against human dignity,'' said the Vatican spokesman, Joaquin Navarro-Valls, adding that the law would pose a ``very serious question of conscience which doctors will have to face.'' But years of intense debate and opinion polls have shown wide support among the Dutch public and the medical profession for the bill, which aims to clarify and define a practice that has become accepted in a country where doctors have helped thousands of terminally ill people die over the past decade. ``Doctors and healers everywhere have helped people put an end to their suffering and helped them die as long as they exist,'' said Rob Jonquiere, the director the Netherlands Association for Voluntary Euthanasia, an advocacy group with more than 100,000 members. ``This will end a gray area. We don't want something that happens anyway to go on underground.'' The new legislation, which was introduced by the Dutch ministers of justice and of health, applies only to physicians and not to others who might help a person die or commit suicide. It incorporates recent guidelines by the Royal Dutch Medical Association. Those stipulate that a patient's request to die must be voluntary, persistent and made while the person is lucid. The physician must be convinced that the patient is facing interminable and unbearable suffering, although the doctor may not suggest death as an option. In all cases, physicians must seek a second medical opinion before helping a patient die, and they must report the cause of death as euthanasia or suicide. Physicians will remain accountable for their actions. What is new, as euthanasia is decriminalized, is that physicians will no longer be accountable to a prosecutor but to a panel of peers, including legal, medical and ethical experts. Under the new legislation, no one has an automatic right to euthanasia _ every doctor has a right to refuse to cooperate when a patient demands assistance to die. One clause in an earlier draft of the legislation which would have permitted terminally ill children 12 or older to choose to die was dropped after it caused a public outcry. As approved Tuesday, the law would require young people from 12 up to 16 to have parental consent. From age 16, they may put the question to their doctor without parental approval. The Dutch decision is likely to draw particular scrutiny in other countries that are wrestling with the questions of doctor-assisted suicide and euthanasia. In Belgium, France and Switzerland, the issue has been under intense debate among legislators and in the news media. In 1996, Australia's Northern Territory first approved and then revoked a law allowing medically assisted suicide. In the United States, Oregon permits doctors in certain cases to help patients end their own lives. In the Netherlands, there have been calls for regulating euthanasia over the past three decades. Demands increased in 1973, when a doctor brought on the death of her aged, dying mother, and she was punished, albeit symbolically, with a one-year suspended sentence. Since then, few doctors have been been prosecuted, but studies suggest that only half or less than half of the cases of euthanasia or assisted suicide are reported, implying that doctors misrepresent the actual cause of death. Last year, unofficial figures indicated that 2,216 patients were assisted by doctors directly or indirectly in speeding up their death, but the number is believed to be closer to 5,000. Almost nine out of ten of the known cases involved people in the terminal stage of cancer.

Sam drives a huge SUV, Pierre drives a tiny Citroen. Both agree that for the sake of the environment they must reduce their combined fuel consumption. But who should bear the burden? You might expect Pierre to demand that Sam do most of the adjusting. All that Sam has to do is switch to a smaller but still comfortable car; Pierre's car can't get much smaller. You certainly wouldn't expect to find Sam trying to wriggle out of the bargain, insisting that he be allowed to adopt a tree instead. But that, more or less, is why efforts to curb global warming collapsed last week. There's plenty of blame to go around, but the essential problem was that Europeans got fed up with America's unwillingness to reduce its emission of greenhouse gases, even though it is the world's prime source of such gases. Why is the United States such a big emitter? Energy use tends to be more or less proportional to gross domestic product, and we have the biggest economy. But that's not the whole story: We release about twice as much carbon dioxide per capita as other advanced countries, even though we don't have anywhere near twice their per capita GDP. The main reason for that disparity is that we have much lower taxes on fuel, especially gasoline. The image of the American filling up his living room on wheels with dollar-a-gallon gasoline while his European counterpart carefully spoons precious petrol into his mini is a caricature, but gets at an essential truth. This comparison suggests that it should actually be much easier for the United States to reduce its energy consumption and carbon dioxide emissions than it is for Europe. High taxes on fuel have already induced Europeans to do the easy conservation steps; in America, where gasoline is literally cheaper than (bottled) water, we haven't even tried. Now it turns out that there are some complicating factors. Some estimates suggest that the cost of meeting international targets for emission reduction would actually be larger for the United States than for Europe, mainly because our economy grows faster, and faster growth increases the demand for energy. Still, one can easily understand European fury at America's refusal to make any serious effort to reduce the amount of carbon it burns. But don't blame our negotiators, or for that matter the administration they work for. They had to respect domestic political realities. And what could the United States actually do to reduce its emission of greenhouse gases? Any Econ 101 textbook can tell you the answer. If carbon dioxide is deemed to inflict damage on the environment, then the efficient way to resolve the problem is to provide market incentives to burn less carbon. The most straightforward policy would be an across-the-board carbon tax that . . . I can't see any point in finishing that sentence. Never mind that even free-market economists favor ``effluent taxes''; never mind that we're not talking about an overall tax increase, that any new tax on carbon could and should be offset by tax cuts elsewhere. In America's current political universe there are too many people who believe that the only good tax is a dead tax for any such proposal to be accepted. Such people aren't a majority, but they do control at least one house of Congress, and it just isn't going to happen. In other words, the ultimate reason that the climate talks failed, that global warming will go unchecked, is the power of America's vitriolic anti-tax right. Is there any way out of this trap? A decisive political defeat for the rabid right might open a path; but that didn't happen in this election. The only alternative would be a Nixon-goes-to-China scenario. It's nice to fantasize that if George W. Bush ends up in the White House he might try to heal the wounds of his dubious triumph by, among other things, taking on his own party over environmental issues. But quite aside from his oil-industry connections and his dismal environmental record in Texas, Bush has said he is not convinced that the scientific evidence for global warming warrants policy action. And somehow I don't expect further evidence to change his mind. Maybe future retirees won't have to move to Florida to find warm weather. It's looking like a long, hot century.

A woman whose husband died in the crash of a Singapore Airlines plane last month filed a wrongful death lawsuit against the airline Tuesday in federal court. In the lawsuit filed in Los Angeles, Johnna Renee Thomas of Mesa, Ariz., claims negligence and reckless misconduct contributed to the crash that killed her 42-year-old husband, Phillip, and 82 other passengers. Her lawyers said it was the first wrongful-death lawsuit filed in the crash. ``The crash was both foreseeable and avoidable,'' said Thomas' lawyer, Frank M. Pietre. ``The pilot made a wrong turn on to the wrong runway and ignored all directives.'' Singapore Airlines spokesman James Boyd wouldn't comment on the lawsuit, but said the airline is offering victims' relatives $400,000 as compensation. Pilot error may have been responsible for the Oct. 31 crash at Chiang Kai-shek International Airport. The crew of the Boeing 747, which was headed to Los Angeles, attempted to take off as a storm hammered the Taiwanese coast. Investigators believe the plane went down a closed runway and struck a concrete barrier and a crane, which ripped the fuselage and caused the aircraft to explode. Thomas alleges the airline didn't properly train its pilots for departing under severe weather and showed a ``disregard for lives and human safety.'' She seeks general and punitive damages as well as economic and property losses. Her husband, an engineer with Motorola, was in Taipei on business and returning to Los Angeles when the crash occurred. One of the crash survivors, John Diaz of Santa Monica, previously filed a lawsuit in federal court blaming the aircraft's pilot for the accident.

For Steven Seymour, it looked like a plum assignment when he accompanied President Carter to Poland in December 1977 as the official interpreter. But he spoke Polish with a Russian accent and many Poles were offended. The result: large headlines over unflattering stories. Sean Lam can identify with Seymour. Lam, a native of Vietnam who migrated to the United States 30 years ago, accompanied President Clinton to Vietnam earlier this month as his interpreter. Among other assignments, he was asked to translate the president's speech at Vietnam National University in Hanoi on Nov. 17. For Lam, it was a nightmarish experience that ended with his replacement the following day by Clinton's national security adviser, Sandy Berger. Normally, the work of interpreters is taken for granted. It is only when things go wrong that people take notice. Seymour's problem was his accent. In Lam's case, the difficulty apparently was logistics and, U.S. Embassy officials said, Lam's southern accent, which can be confusing to northerners, who dominated Clinton's audience. A senior State Department official, speaking on condition of anonymity, gave this account of what ensued: Lam, who had been boning up on a prepared text of the president's speech, was handed a new version just minutes before Clinton strode to the podium. This was a clear setback, but he had the help of another interpreter, Thanh Vuong, who was at his side in the booth as Clinton was speaking. His task was to call attention to areas in the new text that differed from the previous draft. In the middle of the speech, a White House aide ordered Thanh to leave the booth so he could be available to help Clinton with post-speech small talk with the audience. Almost simultaneously, news reporters, having been assigned to use the booth as a workplace, made a noisy arrival. The decibel level was accentuated by the absence of soundproofing. ``He lost his concentration,'' the official said. Lam had an especially difficult time hearing the president's comments on human rights but felt his attempt at paraphrasing was adequate. An unofficial translation suggests that Clinton's listeners were shortchanged. A White House transcript quotes the president as saying as one point: ``In our experience, guaranteeing the right to religious worship and the right to political dissent does not threaten the stability of a society.'' Lam's translation: ``In our experience, allowing the right to religious worship does not affect the institutions. Instead it makes our institutions better.'' Clinton: ``Vietnam has agreed it will subject important decisions to the rule of law and the international trading system, increase the flow of information to its people, and accelerate the rise of a free economy and the private sector.'' The translation got as far as ``international trading system.'' The rest of the sentence was omitted. The embassy received at least three telephone calls from Vietnamese who complained about the translation, and some in the audience gave up and took off their translation headsets. The State Department official said Clinton compounded Lam's problems by speeding up his delivery during the human rights section of his speech. In addition, all of the material in that section had not appeared in the earlier draft and thus was all new to Lam, the official said. Virtually all of these problems would not have occurred if the White House had not waited until the last minute to clear the text. State Department officials say the French, Germans, Chinese and others all have speeches _ and translations _ of the top leadership ready to go with ample lead time. Though Berger relieved Lam of his duties after the speech, the State Department does not hold him responsible for the gaffes and plans to offer him new assignments. As for Seymour, he rebounded smartly from that low point in Warsaw 23 years ago. He is an interpreter at the U.S. Embassy in Moscow and is considered an ace of the staff there. ___ EDITOR'S NOTE _ George Gedda has covered foreign affairs for The Associated Press since 1968. ___ On the Net: State Department site: http://www.state.gov

In Haiti, Jean-Bertrand Aristide has been declared the winner in last Sunday's controversial presidential election. NPR's Jerry Hadden reports. Former president Aristeed won with 92 percent of the vote according to Haitian election officials. The sweeping victory was expected since Aristeed ran virtually unopposed. Opposition candidates boycotted the vote citing tainted legislative elections last May. Aristeed was elected President for the first time ten years ago and served just months before a military coup sent him into exile in the United States. He now faces huge obstacles is as Haiti's leader. His country is the poorest in the hemisphere and much of the world community has shunned him. On Wednesday UN Secretary General Kofi Annan called on his organization to close its mission in Haiti citing the unstable political climate. Though a spate of pre-election violence kept some Haitians away from the polls on Sunday, the voting itself went relatively smoothly. Jerry Hadden, NPR News.

The Voice of America presents differing points of view on a wide variety of issues. Next, an editorial expressing the policies of the United States government. Valentine Paniagua is now heading an interim government in Peru. He selected former United Nations Secretary General Haviar Perez Dequia as Prime Minister, Haviar Silva as Economy Minister and Diego Garcia, a respected judicial and human rights expert, as Justice Minister. President Paniagua is the former head of the Peruvian Congress. He was chosen to replace the deposed President Alberto Fujimori. Mr. Paniagua's caretaker government will serve until presidential elections next April. President Fujimori's grip on power was broken by a corruption scandal involving ex-intelligence advisor Vladimiro Montecinos. Mr. Fujimori announced from Japan that he was stepping down from the presidency. But opposition lawmakers did not accept his resignation. They voted instead, to vacate the presidency on constitutional grounds of moral incapacity. Now, a special prosecutor is investigating both Fujimori and Montecinos, who went into hiding in October. In many years of public service in Peru, Mr. Paniagua showed his commitment to civic leadership. As Congressional leader, he was a member of the National Dialogue on Democratic Reform. Now, as President, he has a mandate to lead Peru toward national reconciliation. The United States looks forward to working with President Paniagua and his administration. While the US does not support any particular individual or party, the US does support a free and fair electoral process. President Paniagua has vowed that the April 8th elections will be free and fair. He has stressed that human rights, particularly freedom of expression, must be respected. He has also indicated that reform is needed in Peru's judiciary and intelligence and security services. The government and people of Peru can count on the support of the United States as they work to reform their democratic institutions.

Former Prime Minister Federico Salas testified Wednesday in Congress that fugitive ex-spy chief Vladimiro Montesinos threatened a military coup against former President Alberto Fujimori's government. ``I lived with this threat of a coup,'' Salas said, offering a rare insider account of those days in mid-September after a corruption scandal erupted around the spy chief, signaling an end to Fujimori's decade of authoritarian rule. Salas said, following Fujimori's instructions, that he phoned Montesinos and demanded his resignation. Montesinos' reply was chilling. He said that: ``No president, much less a puny chief of the Cabinet, had the power to force him from his position, and that he had 3,000 armed men, and that furthermore, if he wanted to, he could carry out a coup d'etat at that moment,'' Salas recalled. Salas said Montesinos indicated that if he continued to insist on the resignation, Salas would not exit the palace gates alive. The incident occurred a few days after Montesinos appeared in a leaked videotape on Sept. 14 apparently bribing an opposition congressman. The video's broadcast prompted Fujimori two days later to announce new elections next April in which he would not be a candidate. Congress ousted Fujimori from office last week, declaring him morally unfit for the presidency and ignoring his resignation faxed in from self-imposed exile in Japan. Montesinos, who is believed to be protected by military allies, has been in hiding since his return to Peru last month from a failed asylum bid in Panama. Salas' testimony came before a congressional committee set up to investigate Montesinos' reputed web of money laundering, narcotics trafficking and influence peddling. Salas said he went to Montesinos' intelligence headquarters to try to persuade the spy chief to step aside. ``When I arrived at Montesinos' office, not only was he waiting for me, but also all of the commanding generals of the army and the chief of the national police,'' Salas said. ``You must understand, if I go, everyone goes. If the king falls, the servant falls,'' Salas recalled Montesinos saying. Salas also gave details of the widespread telephone tapping carried out by Montesinos at the highest levels of government. He said when he phoned Fujimori to discuss whether to allow Montesinos to stay in power or try to force him to resign that the president replied that there was ``always a third option'' but did not elaborate. He said Montesinos, who had been listening in on the call, phoned him two minutes later to ask what Fujimori meant when he referred to a third option. He said he later organized Montesinos' trip to Panama. The arrangements were made with Panamanian officials after the Organization of American States and various governments intervened to find a country that would take the shadowy spymaster, he said. But Montesinos' returned to Peru on Oct. 23 after his asylum bid in Panama failed. Salas said Fujimori fell into a deep depression. ``He was totally depressed,'' Salas repeated several times during his testimony, adding that when Fujimori left the country two weeks ago, he appeared a broken man, barely able to govern. Salas said he refused to meet in the Government Palace with interim President Valentin Paniagua, sworn in last week to replace Fujimori, warning Paniagua that the palace was bugged. Salas stepped down as prime minister last weekend when Paniagua swore in a new cabinet.

With Vicente Fox's inauguration as president of Mexico hours away, Ramona Pena, 65 and a grandmother of five, decided to get his attention. So she hoisted a handmade poster calling the Mexican government a ``bunch of rats,'' and plunged with three gray-haired girlfriends into eight lanes of rush-hour chaos on the capital's biggest boulevard, Reforma Avenue. Some 400 other government retirees followed, bringing traffic to a honking halt. Men wearing toupees and their best three-piece suits held the older women by the hand. Together they vowed to stay in the streets until the government raised their pensions. The former transit police, physical-education teachers, accountants and secretaries said that after 30 years of working for the government they received less than $150 a month. ``After all of our service, they are letting us starve to death,'' Pena shouted. ``Not one more car can pass until we get justice.'' Although the retired secretary growled like a battle-scarred activist, she said later that she had never joined protests before because she never thought the people in power would listen. But she and her friends think they will start listening _ after Fox is inaugurated on Friday morning. ``He has promised change, and to take care of the needs of the poor,'' Pena said. ``That is why we voted for him. Now it is his turn to deliver.'' Five months after winning Mexico's cleanest national elections, Fox, 58, will be the first president in seven decades to rise to power by the will of the people rather than the forces of an entrenched political machine. His victory shattered the Institutional Revolutionary Party's 71 years of control; it has been celebrated here and abroad as the foundation for the construction of Mexico's first true democracy. The president-elect, a former Coca-Cola executive from the conservative National Action Party, has promised this country nothing less than a second Mexican revolution, bringing jobs, education, security, honest government and a measure of justice. Most of all, he promised them change. If he succeeds, he has said, he will be the greatest president Mexico has ever known, and if he fails, he will be reviled as a traitor and a fraud. Millions of people from every corner of the country have looked forward with hope and anticipation to Fox's inauguration, which will be followed by an address to the nation and a rally in the capital's main plaza. Interviews with several dozen people along Reforma, a prestigious boulevard that cuts through the heart of Mexico City, offers a glimpse at the nation's exhilaration. In coffee shops and taco stands, office buildings and shopping malls, bookstores and vegetable markets, people from all walks of life and ideologies spoke with pride about their country's peaceful transition of power. College students swooned over the strapping president-elect, the first single man to be sworn in as head of state. And when pressed to think about Fox's presidential attributes, the young women said they believed that Fox, raised on a ranch, would respond to the needs of the poor. At the attorney general's offices, bureaucrats waiting in line for their paychecks said they felt nervous watching their bosses from the PRI pack up their offices to make room for Fox's new team. And they hoped that they would be able to keep their jobs. Construction workers talked about wanting better schools for their children and better wages for their work. A bank manager said he hoped for a beginning to the end of official corruption; his colleague just wanted to feel safe enough to walk around his neighborhood at night. Benito Adraca Sanchez, a 46-year-old electrician and father of four who earns a little more than $100 a week, said, ``We hope that he is a good president and that he fulfills all the promises he has made, like helping those with the greatest needs, raising salaries and increasing employment for the working class.'' Still, the excitement about the inauguration has not erased the distrust people feel toward the government after seven decades scarred by crooked politicians, stolen elections, unsolved assassinations and widespread injustice. Some worried that Fox, a devout Roman Catholic, would give the church too much influence in his government. And there were those who worried that the president-elect's ties to big business would diminish his commitments to small companies. Martin Sanchez, a 25-year-old farmer from the state of Puebla, attending mass at the Basilica of Guadalupe, predicted that once Fox took office, he would probably abandon his promises. ``Politicians always make promises and then when they take office they forget about the people,'' he said. ``I am not very optimistic about what he will be able to accomplish.'' Even true believers doubted Fox could achieve all he has pledged. But most said they were simply desperate for change, often in ways that seemed too deep for words. ``I just want to feel proud of my government and my country,'' said Jose Armando Luce Perez, 46, who works as a manager of an ice cream parlor along tree-shaded cul-de-sac called Washington Plaza. In Garabaldi Plaza, among the dozens of mariachi bands roaming in search of paying patrons, a singer dressed in silver-studded pants a wide-brimmed sombreros, stood Antonio de Montecristo, 58. Like Fox, he is from the central state of Guanajuato, a place so racked by unemployment that tens of thousands of workers migrate each year to the United States. ``The first thing that Fox must do is to end insecurity and open up opportunities for jobs,'' he said. ``He has to put the country to work.'' Farther east on Reforma, a garbageman, Salvador Nolasco, 55, collected trash around the capital's main plaza, the Zocalo. He spoke out about crooked police who press people for bribes, and said corruption infects all of the government, even the sanitation office. His bosses, he said, often take out a portion of his salary each week. They tell him that the money is used to pay union dues. But Nolasco believes that is a lie. The amount deducted from his pay varies from week to week, he said, and he has never seen any union benefits. ``Fox said that in 100 days we will see results,'' Nolasco said. ``I believe him. But if he does not deliver, I will complain because I am tired of politicians deceiving us.''

Outgoing U.S. drug policy director Gen. Barry McCaffrey said police corruption is helping keep drug traffickers out of jail in Mexico, but expressed confidence the country's new government is up to the task of combating narcotics. McCaffrey, who arrived in Mexico Thursday to attend President-elect Vicente Fox's inauguration, also said the United States must do more to help Mexico overcome drug and immigration problems. He cited the case of the Tijuana-based Arellano Felix brothers, Mexico's most wanted traffickers, who have managed to escape arrest for the past five years. ``The corruption of state-level and local police, in particular, is so intense, these people are so well armed and dangerous that it's very difficult to get at them,'' McCaffrey said in a telephone interview prior to his arrival in Mexico. But he said federal police have made good-faith efforts to capture the brothers, who he said run ``one of the most dangerous criminal organizations on the face of the earth. Literally hundreds of Mexicans get murdered by these people on an annual basis.'' McCaffrey said he was encouraged by the law enforcement officials Fox has chosen, calling them ``a pretty solid team, pragmatist, bright as can be.'' Fox has said he wants to gradually decrease the army's large role in law enforcement, but McCaffrey said he believes the Mexican military should continue to patrol for drug shipments and eradicate drug crops. ``It's hard to imagine that Mr. Fox will want to walk away from the enormous good being done by the Mexican armed forces,'' McCaffrey said. He brushed aside a local newspaper report that an alleged money launderer may have used an airplane owned by Fox's proposed federal police chief, Alejandro Gertz, to fly to the United States. ``You never know what to make of this stuff,'' McCaffrey said, noting that honest officials are sometimes linked to such reports. ``As you vet new names, if the druggies are worried about the guy, when the name comes up, they kick up an objection.'' McCaffrey has been burned in the past: He praised former Gen. Jesus Gutierrez Rebollo when he was appointed Mexico's drug czar in late 1996. A few weeks later, Gutierrez Rebollo was jailed for taking bribes from a Mexican drug cartel. McCaffrey said traffickers appear to have come up with a new route to the U.S. market, flying small planes below radar cover to land at properties bought by Mexican traffickers inside the United States. But Mexico is suffering as much or more from the drug trade. ``Their drug use rates are skyrocketing among their own domestic population, both in Mexico City and along the border,'' he said, saying more must be done to stop U.S. weapons and drug profits flowing south. McCaffrey, who will leave his post in January to teach at West Point and write a book about the drug war, also said the United States should address the wider aspects of relations with Mexico. ``We need to come up with a political way for the United States to have the labor it so desperately needs move across that border legally, in buses with minimum wage, with protection, with health care, minimal standards of housing,'' McCaffrey said. ``We ought to be ashamed on both sides of the border that we accept food on our plates given us to by Mexican labor, and we haven't come up with a way to ensure they're sleeping on cots and have sanitation.''

An earthquake rocked Mexico City hours before the inauguration of President-elect Vicente Fox on Friday morning, and the Popocatepetl volcano that towers over the capital shot out a plume of ash. There were no immediate reports of damage or injuries from the earthquake, which caused buildings in the capital to sway at about 8:10 a.m. There were also no immediate reports of where the earthquake might be centered or of its magnitude. Mexico City is often affected by quakes centered hundreds of miles away. The 17,886-foot Popocatepetl sent out more than a mile-long plume of ash and gas at dawn on Friday. The National Center for the Prevention of Disasters said it recorded tremors from the volcano. The center maintained a standing warning for people to stay at least six miles away from the volcano some 40 miles southeast of Mexico City. The volcano has erupted repeatedly in recent years.

A new government took office at midnight, ending 71 years of ruling-party domination and beginning a day that some Mexicans have hoped for _ and others have feared _ for generations. Vicente Fox prepared to take the oath of the presidency Friday in an act that would mark the first peaceful transfer of power to an opposition party in Mexico's history. ``This is a great day for me and for Mexicans,'' Fox said as he left his hotel Friday morning. Democracy dawned with a spurt of ash from the Popocatepetl volcano that overlooks the capital and an earthquake that slightly shook tall buildings in Mexico City, with no reports of damage. Fox entered office to an enthusiasm that blurred, at least momentarily, ideological lines and political interests across the nation. Even the long-silent Zapatista rebel leader Subcomandante Marcos, hunkered down in the jungle of Mexico's southern Chiapas state, saw some hope. ``For us, the nightmare ends today,'' he wrote. ``Another could follow, or it could be a new dawn. We will do everything in our power to make that dawn flourish.'' Fox began the day unlike any president in the past 130 years _ with a visit to a basilica to pray to the Virgin of Guadalupe, Mexico's patron saint. All Mexican presidents had shunned religious displays since 18th century struggles over the Roman Catholic church's privileged role in the country. He was already behind schedule. His motorcade moved slowly through the streets, stopping periodically for Fox to wave to people who lined the sidewalks. Members of Fox's Cabinet, packed with businessmen, began to take over their new posts. Interior Secretary Santiago Creel, the man Fox picked to lead negotiations to reshape Mexico's shattered political landscape, assumed his duties in a midnight ceremony. Defense Secretary Gen. Ricardo Vega and Attorney General Gen. Rafael Macedo also were preparing to take office as the new day began. Fox himself was to be sworn in around midday. Like other new leaders in Latin America _ a region long riven by sharp extremes of right and left _ Fox came to power as an ideological hybrid, an energetic populist who courted everyone from street kids to corporate tycoons. That style, and the enthusiasm for Mexico's step toward democracy, was reflected in Fox's inauguration ceremonies. His first planned stop of the day was a breakfast with homeless children. Then it was on to a series of events that had him rubbing elbows with such obvious opposites as Cuban President Fidel Castro and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright _ and many others in between. Leaders of 15 Latin American countries were expected. Fox will need all of the above on board if he is to rebuild Mexico as promised. He inherits a country filled with poverty and corruption _ but also one with a new hope for the future. Hundreds of thousands of people were expected at the rallies Fox planned on his three-day inauguration tour of four Mexican cities, during which he will meet with peasants, Indians, artists and intellectuals. Fox has denied that his grandiose inauguration marked a return to the stark contrasts of state opulence and widespread poverty that prevailed before Mexico's 1910 revolution. Fox, a member of the right-of-center National Action Party, won office in July by defeating Francisco Labastida of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI. The PRI had dominated Mexican politics since 1929, and for party members Friday was a day as strange as it was unexpected. Out of power for the first time since it was founded, its leaders had to start thinking about how to handle the unfamiliar role of an opposition party.

Vicente Fox spent three years running for president. His first hour in power made it clear that he will have to spend the next six years campaigning as hard as he can to accomplish half of what he has promised. The hostility that he faced from the old governing party's politicians in a joint session of Congress on Friday as he made his inaugural speech hung in the air like a choking haze. They kept their seats as he entered the room. They sat on their hands as he took the mantle of power. And as soon as he opened his mouth, talking of dialogue and compromise, they started hooting and jeering. One shouted, ``Liar!'' Fox took it in stride. ``This is the new reality of power in Mexico,'' he said Friday. ``The force of the nation can no longer come from a single point of view, a single party, a single philosophy.'' Now, having taken the presidency from the Institutional Revolutionary Party _ until Friday the world's longest-governing political tribe, an inbred clique that corrupted much of what it touched over seven decades _ Fox has to use his power to transform the state. He has an old order to dismantle, a new one to build, and six years to do it. What he called in his speech ``a political culture in which accord has been seen as an act of capitulation'' is clearly alive and thriving. But in the streets, hopes are high and rising that Fox can make good his huge promises to create a justice system that does justice, an economy that provides jobs for the poor and middle class, a society liberated from corruption. Fox says his election signaled not only a popular desire for ``political change, a change of party, a change of government,'' but also ``something much more profound, something that emerged from within the heart of each Mexican _ overflowing joy, jubilation, hope, expectations, faith, a sense of responsibility and optimism in the future.'' That is a lot for one politician to handle alone, especially a one-term governor of a medium-sized state elected with 43 percent of the vote who is facing a divided Congress where the old governing party has a plurality, no side holds a majority and opponents are already throwing stones. Fox says he will have to tour the nation ceaselessly, campaigning for change, while sleeping in a bungalow on the grounds of the presidential mansion, Los Pinos, not in the presidential suite. Nothing happens in Los Pinos, he says _ things happen outside, in the streets of the capital and the cities and villages of Mexico, and that is where he says he wants to be. He says his goal is to bring jobs, education and security to a country where half the population is poor; where only the richest tenth have a chance to go to college, and the poorest tenth rarely make it past the first grade; where crime, corruption and impunity warp society. He has an increasingly clear sense of where to begin: at the bottom. Among Fox's first initiatives, he says, will be to create grants to help poor and middle-class people get a college education; micro-credits to help small businesses prosper; and what he calls a ``crusade for peace'' in the southern state of Chiapas, a bastion of poverty and the seat of a smoldering leftist rebellion. He also has an eye on revising Mexico's laws in the name of reforming the justice system, making the rich _ and the poor _ pay taxes, and even excavating buried secrets of state. Fox comes from a party that positions itself to the right of center _ pro-business, pro-Catholic, pro-American. But he ran for president on his own, and the party followed. And during that long three-year run, he appeared to straddle the political divide. His appetite for big ideas, his appointments and his promises all suggest a man looking for political convergence _ the elusive Third Way, that triangulation of right and left that politicians like President Clinton and the British prime minister, Tony Blair, have sought but not quite realized. This week, he set in motion a whirl of newly anointed officials charged with remaking Mexico's economy, its relations with the United States, its security apparatus. The appointments, like Fox's ideas, were all over the political map. He made men of the left foreign minister and national security counselor. Then he named the nation's chief military prosecutor, a tough-minded army general, as justice minister, confounding Mexican human-rights groups, who say the general willfully ignored acts of torture committed by soldiers acting as police. Then he stripped potential police-state powers from the once all-powerful interior ministry, taking away its intelligence service, which mainly spied on Mexicans. He will be the first Mexican leader to approach the United States as a partner, eye-to-eye. The trade relationship makes this possible: Mexico is now the second largest buyer of U.S. goods _ surpassing Japan, though its economy is seven times smaller _ and the United States buys nearly 90 percent of Mexico's exports. In the past, Mexican leaders, wedded to nationalist ideology, often took a folded-arms stance toward the United States. But Fox and his economic team have noted that people cannot eat a sense of pride; they want jobs, not flags. Fox would love to take Mexico off the World Bank's list of the world's most crooked nations, where it recently ranked fourth, after Indonesia, Thailand and Nigeria. That means changing a culture of corruption that has run from rookie policemen to the most powerful politicians. For starters, he will ask Congress to abolish the law that makes public officials _ including the president _ immune from prosecution. Most ripe for revolution is the way the people of Mexico perceive their president. A one-party parade of generals, lawyers and technocrats serving as presidents earned Mexico the epithet of ``the perfect dictatorship'' _ a government with mere trappings of democracy, and the power to crush opponents. That power kept the man in Los Pinos, and his ministers remote from the populace. The next few months will show whether Fox is more than a politician riding a populist image of an ordinary guy in blue jeans and cowboy boots, trying to lasso and harness unbridled forces of change. History has had a way of defeating people's hopes in Mexico, but Fox gives every appearance of a man seeking to turn popular aspirations into political struggles.

Vicente Fox was sworn in as president of Mexico on Friday, ending 71 years of single-party rule and vowing ``to demolish all vestiges of authoritarianism'' Standing before a joint session of Mexico's Congress, Fox took the oath of office in the first peaceful transfer of power to an opposition party in Mexico's history, a moment many had dreamed of _ and others had feared _ for generations. ``What is at stake over the next six years is not just the change of a party in power. What is at stake is much more significant and profound: the hopes of millions of Mexicans,'' Fox said. He appealed for national dialogue _ something he will need as he works with the most divided Congress in a century _ and vowed a government of tolerance for all viewpoints. After naming a Cabinet heavy with conservative businessmen, Fox launched his six-year term with a speech meant to assure Mexicans he will attack poverty and social injustice, and that the fight against crime, drug-smuggling and corruption would go beyond muscle. ``No police force can stop hunger and unemployment,'' he said. Democracy dawned with a spurt of ash from the Popocatepetl volcano that overlooks the capital and an earthquake that slightly shook tall buildings in Mexico City. There were no reports of damage. Fox entered office to an enthusiasm that blurred, at least momentarily, ideological lines and political interests across the nation. Even the long-silent Zapatista rebel leader Subcomandante Marcos, hunkered down in the jungle of Mexico's southern Chiapas state, saw some hope. ``For us, the nightmare ends today,'' he wrote. ``Another could follow, or it could be a new dawn.'' Fox, obviously responding in his speech to the nation, said: ``In Mexico and in Chiapas there will be a new dawn.'' He also paraphrased a famous statement by the Zapatistas, telling Mexico's Indians: ``Never again a Mexico without you.'' He promised that the first law he proposes to Congress will be a Zapatista-backed Indian rights act that outgoing President Ernesto Zedillo had refused to accept. Congressmen from the Institutional Revolutionary Party, in opposition for the first time, shouted taunts at Fox _ a practice for which they had criticized other parties in the past. In contrast to the stiff delivery of past presidents, Fox showed touches of humor. ``Calm down, we're getting there,'' he said with a grin when shouts indicated some were growing impatient. Often accused of overly optimistic promises and famed for his cowboy boots, Fox playfully assured Congress: ``I have my boots firmly planted on the ground.'' Fox began the day unlike any president in well over a century _ with a visit to the Basilica of the Virgin of Guadalupe, Mexico's patron saint. All Mexican presidents had shunned religious displays since 18th-century struggles against the Roman Catholic church's privileged role in the country. Fox spent several moments kneeling at the altar in silent prayer, often gazing up at the image of the Virgin, before leaving to shouts of ``Viva Vicente!'' from other worshippers. His motorcade threaded slowly through crowds of people waving from the sidewalks, and sometimes had to stop as police cleared the way. Fox then had an open-air breakfast with street children in Mexico City's notorious Tepito neighborhood. Wearing a blue work shirt and jeans, Fox chatted and laughed with children, handing out tamales and pouring cups of atole _ a traditional drink based on corn starch _ as mariachis played. He ducked into a slum apartment in Tepito to change into his suit before being driven to Congress for the inauguration. Members of Fox's Cabinet had begun to take over their new posts at midnight, as Interior Secretary Santiago Creel, the man Fox picked to lead negotiations to reshape Mexico's shattered political landscape, assumed his duties. Like other new leaders in Latin America _ a region long riven by sharp extremes of right and left _ Fox came to power as an ideological hybrid, an energetic populist who courted everyone from street kids to corporate tycoons. Among the inaugural guests were Cuban President Fidel Castro, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and the leaders of more than a dozen Latin American countries. Hundreds of thousands of people were expected at the rallies Fox planned on his three-day inauguration tour of four Mexican cities, during which he will meet with peasants, Indians, artists and intellectuals. Fox has denied that his grandiose inauguration marked a return to the stark contrasts of state opulence and widespread poverty that prevailed before Mexico's 1910 revolution. Fox, a member of the right-of-center National Action Party, won office in July by defeating Francisco Labastida of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI. The PRI had dominated Mexican politics since 1929.

This is The World, I am Lisa Mullins. History was made in Mexico today when Vicente Fox was sworn in as President. This was no ordinary inauguration. It marked the first peaceful transfer of power to the opposition in Mexico's history. Few Mexicans can remember when their President was not a member of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, whose 71 years in power ended this afternoon. Fox, a conservative, leads the National Action Party. The World's Frank Contraris is in Mexico City. Frank, the swearing in ceremony is now over. What did President Fox have to say? President Vicente Fox touched on the biggest, most troubling issues facing Mexicans today. He spoke about what he can do to solve the poverty that has driven so many hundreds of thousands of people North, into the United States seeking work. He wants to try to find a way to keep them home. And one of the other things that he touched on, Lisa, he says that Mexico never again will return to repressive means to try to control the people. My government will not tolerate that these methods of the past be used again. We will not use the security forces of our country to silence critics or neutralize opponents. Repression will never again be a way to resolve political disputes. And one of the other main subjects he touched on today, Lisa, was the conflicted southern state of Chiapas. Fox says that his first presidential act will be to send up a proposal to the Congress to immediately begin to bring a process of peace back into Chiapas state and that's something that people really didn't expect to happen so quickly here. All of these issues actually are issues that the United States has been watching very carefully. And US Secretary of State Madeleine Albright is there in Mexico City for the inaugural. She is meeting with Mexico's new foreign minister, who is the writer and academic Jorge Castaneda. He, in fact, lived in New York for a number of years. What has the new President Fox said so far about relations with the United States? Fox says that Mexico's relations with the US are strong, but he sees opportunities. He still is convinced that he can talk to the United States government into opening up its borders and eventually letting in more Mexican's under the free trade agreement. More Mexicans, who would come in to the country legally. Fox believes that it in 20 or 30 years the United States, Canada and all of Latin America should be one unified market, much in a way that the European community is unified. And so Fox is going to use his marketing sensibility to try to convince the American people that this is the way to go. Remember, Fox comes from a strong marketing background. He was the executive of Coca-Cola from Mexico, so he understands how these things work. I wonder if you can tell us a little bit about something that Cuban President Fidel Castro, who is also there today, said earlier in the week. He said that the previous President Ernesto Zedillo was too much of a servant to the United States. Is that issue something that Fox is likely to pay attention to? Is that kind of a warning for Fox at all? That's definitely a message to Vicente Fox from Fidel Castro and I am sure that other Latin American President's feel the same way. But Fox really has already shown very early on that he is going to try to be an unusual kind of leader with the United States, he is not going to kowtow to Washington. In fact, just weeks after he was elected he showed Washington that he has his own initiatives and some of them might even frighten leaders in our national capital there. So I think you can expect Fox to continue the economic policies that Mexico has been criticized for, that is following the economic lead of the United States. But at the same time he will come up with concrete policies for dealing with immigrants rights and other such matters that we have never really seen before. The World's Frank Contraris in Mexico City. Frank Contraris, thank you again. Thank you, Lisa.

Vicente Fox, a son of ranchers and a one-time business executive, was inaugurated as president of Mexico Friday, promising that in the dawn of Mexico's first real democracy, he would share the power long monopolized by one party. After swearing before Congress to uphold the constitution, Fox, 58, accepted a satiny red, white and green presidential sash from the outgoing chief executive, Ernesto Zedillo , who by law could not seek re-election. In that brief moment, Fox became the first opposition politician in 71 years to take the presidency away from the Institutional Revolutionary Party. Before the PRI, all of Mexico's rulers had come to power by force or political imposition. In an inaugural address before Congress, Fox lilted at times from his own excitement about the occasion, which he described as a ``triumph for all.'' He invoked the names of Mexico's most beloved reformers, many of them assassinated at the peak of their crusades, and promised that his government would live up to their ideals. Then he laid out plans for a new kind of Mexican government: One in which the voice of opponents would not be snuffed out or ignored; one that would serve the interests of the poor before those of the rich, and one that would fight discrimination, official corruption and human rights abuses. Although he will lack a majority in Congress as he tries to fulfill his goals, Fox said that he would press ahead with his campaign promise to establish a kind of truth commission to investigate unsolved corruption scandals and political assassinations. He received rapturous applause from members of Congress when he pledged that his government would not push to privatize electricity plants nor sell the national oil company, Pemex, considered a pillar of Mexican sovereignty. Fox said that he would try to be the president Mexico has never had, one who accepts and even enjoys having his power balanced by a divided Congress, strong state governors and grass-roots organizations that directly represent the people. ``I differ radically from the old view that power is not to be shared,'' Fox said. ``I will share the power, and also the responsibilities. I am the guardian of power, not its owner. ``I will not be a do-all president,'' he said. ``Ending with us is the age in which the president was omnipresent on the national stage. It is no longer one person, or one government that is responsible for the destiny of the nation,'' he said. ``All of us, in the trenches of our daily lives, have a role to play in the great struggle for a better Mexico.'' Fox's most forceful overtures were aimed at Mexico's Indian people, who make up about 10 percent of the nation's population, but who have almost no political and economic clout. In his inaugural address, Fox lamented that most indigenous people continue to suffer ``intolerable injustice, marginalization and inequality.'' Their communities struggle against levels of illiteracy, hunger and poverty that dwarf the national averages. The new president said he would assume direct responsibility for creating more opportunities for indigenous people to participate in government activities, and for guaranteeing their political rights. He also used the speech to send a message of peace to the conflict-ravaged state of Chiapas, where ragtag groups of indigenous guerrillas took up arms against the government six years ago to protest against generations of injustice and other abuses. The new president said that he would immediately seek the legislature's approval of national reforms that had been proposed four years ago by a group of congressional mediators. The reforms reflected many of the rebel' demands, but were blocked by the Zedillo administration. Fox has said many times since he was elected in July to a six-year term that he was ready to meet with the Zapatistas and accept some of their most important demands _ including removing a number of government troops from the region. But the Zapatistas never replied. Then, 48 hours before Fox's inauguration, the best-known Zapatista leader, who calls himself Subcommander Marcos, ended the rebels' silence by issuing a scathing farewell to outgoing Zedillo, calling his six years in office ``a nightmare.'' And Marcos also said he would hold a press conference on Saturday, in an isolated part of the Chiapas jungle, to talk about the Zapatistas' position toward the Fox administration. Having risen to power on the wave of a national desire for a shift to democracy, Fox, the father of four adopted children, started his presidency with an inauguration day filled with activities aimed at setting him apart from his predecessors. Just after sunrise, the devout Catholic went to pray at the Basilica de Guadalupe, the shrine to Mexico's patron saint. He was the first modern president ever to publicly receive a blessing by a priest before taking office. It was an unusual religious display by a head of state in a country that has had a bloody tradition of enforcing the separation between church and state. Later, in the middle of his speech at the national auditorium, his youngest daughter, Paulina, a teen-ager, ran up to the podium to give him a gift of a crucifix. Fox also had breakfast with hundreds of homeless children, mental health patients and street vendors in the outcast community of Tepito. In another break with tradition, he gave two speeches during the day rather than one. He started his formal inaugural address with a tender ``hello'' to each of his children. And afterward, Fox delivered a funny and humble speech to an auditorium filled with supporters. Rather than bestowing power privately upon his new Cabinet, he inaugurated them on live television. He read aloud government ethics rules, which prohibit members of the Cabinet from taking money from any sources that would compromise their integrity. And then he made them swear to uphold those rules. At dusk, he stood out on the balcony of the National Palace and led tens of thousands of Mexicans in a patriotic rally at the Zocalo, the plaza at the center of the capital. But after delivering another speech, the president took off his ceremonial sash, his suit jacket, tie and cuff links, and waded into the crowded plaza where he sat on a stage among the people. Later, he held an elegant dinner for visiting dignitaries at the 18th century castle in Chapultepec Park. It was a whirlwind day, and as Fox rushed from one event to the next, it became clear that even though he was now president, he would continue to keep the pace of a candidate. His staff said that being among ordinary people is where the president feels most comfortable. And during his speeches, the new president, whose preferred style of dress includes jeans, cowboy boots and wide-brimmed hats, reminded Mexico that, ``I have my boots well set on the ground.'' But because Fox's National Action Party will not have the majority in Congress, the new president is expected to continue to campaign in order to harness public support for the deep and controversial reforms he aims to implement.

Soldiers began packing up and withdrawing from some of the tensest areas of southern Chiapas state on Friday only hours after a new president took office. President Vicente Fox gave the withdrawal order hours after his inauguration as Mexico's first opposition president in 71 years, military officials here confirmed Friday night. Fox also said Friday he was sending an Indian-rights bill to Congress. The Zapatista rebels, who staged an uprising on Jan. 1, 1994, have demanded that Mexico withdraw troops from the area and implement the Indian-rights measure before they will return to the negotiating table. With those two conditions met, a scheduled news conference deep in the jungle with Zapatista leader Subcomandante Marcos on Saturday afternoon was being closely watched. The military official said troops removed 53 roadblocks around Chiapas state and began pulling out of the town of Amador Hernandez, where there have been daily clashes between residents and soldiers since the army set up in August 1999. Former President Ernesto Zedillo had refused to implement the Indian-rights accord and had sent thousands of soldiers into Indian towns in Chiapas, a poor state bordering Guatemala. Marcos, the ski-masked leader of the rebels, broke a five-month silence with a communique on Wednesday, gloating over Zedillo's loss but indicating he still wasn't sure what to think of Fox. ``It has been a long nightmare for millions of Mexicans,'' Marcos wrote. ``For us the nightmare ends today. Another could follow, or it could be a new dawn.'' Fox clearly was trying to win over Marcos trust when in his inaugural speech on Friday, he said: ``Today a new dawn begins for Chiapas.''

the united states is stepping up its pressure on afghanistan's taliban government over osama bin laden. it wants the taliban to stop harboring the suspect terrorist, or else. david ensor explains. u.s. officials tell cnn the taliban leadership of afghanistan was bluntly warned at a secret meeting in germany that if it continues to shelter accused terrorist mastermind osama bin laden, there will be a heavy price to pay. that price may start to come due next week at the united nations, where the u.s. and russia are working together to pass a resolution demanding that the taliban expel bin laden and curtail the illegal drug trade. it would tighten existing sanctions, adding an arms ban against the taliban and would threaten more to come if the resolution's demands are not met. sanctions are against the taliban, not against afghanistan in general. it's the taliban that is sheltering bin laden, not the opponents or anybody else in afghanistan. the resolution pointedly does not ban arms sales to the afghan opposition, to the forces of ahmed massoud, which still control a sizeable northeastern section of the country, though they have taken a pounding from taliban forces this year. even before the secret meeting in germany, the taliban had been repeatedly warned by u.s. officials that their government, too, would be held responsible if bin laden should organize further attacks against americans from his sanctuary in afghanistan. that warning clearly applies if the u.s. obtains what it does not yet have -- proof that bin laden was involved in the bombing of the "uss cole." bin laden helps the taliban militarily in terms of money and men, and the taliban give him shelter and the ability to plan future operations, so really they're just sort of two links in the same chain. if proof should emerge that bin laden was involved in the "cole" bombing, officials have said all options would be on the table, including military retaliation. meantime, senior officials say that the u.s. and russia have started sharing intelligence on bin laden, including, one official said, "some interesting stuff" from moscow. david ensor, cnn, washington.

In an era when an American president beguiles crowds in Vietnam, and China is a key trading partner, U.S. policy-makers still need to be reminded of their victory over communism when talk turns to Cuba. Cuba's transition to a free-market democracy is inevitable, a bipartisan task force of the Council on Foreign Relations declared in a report issued Wednesday. The committee asserted that the United States should move faster to open and increase a variety of contacts. Yet whenever Washington focuses on that nearby island with 11 million people, peculiar things happen. Reason slips, tempers flare. And the custodians of the current hard-line policy are out of sync with the general public, which increasingly favors a less hostile stance toward Havana. In October, Republican leaders stymied votes in both houses to open Cuba to more trade and travel. The bill finally signed by the president legalized the sale of food but denied vital funding; rather than increase travel, it froze current restrictions by codifying them into law. Rep. Mark Sanford, R-S.C., got a taste of the Cuba warp last summer, when he had won broad support for a measure to let Americans visit the island freely. After the vote, he sought to clear the air with his long-time ally, Tom DeLay, the Republican whip, who remains an ardent foe of any softening toward Havana. What he got was a nasty fight. The two men turned red in the face as they screamed at each other. The spectacle on the House floor left staffers awkwardly staring at their shoes. Later, in conference, DeLay helped kill Sanford's bill. After four decades of seeking to topple, discredit and isolate the Cuban leader, Fidel Castro, the defense of the current U.S. policy increasingly relies on strong-arm tactics and back-room deals. Meanwhile, surveys show most Americans want a new approach. They want more interaction and trade. A recent poll by Florida International University found 80 percent of Americans would support a dialogue with the Cuban government. They favor the sale of food (86 percent) and medicine (90 percent). A key recommendation by the council task force urged opening Cuba to travel by all Americans. Some people aren't waiting on Washington. Though officially barred from spending money in Cuba, an estimated 22,000 Americans illegally flew in as tourists from third countries last year. An additional 135,000 took part in authorized visits for academic, cultural and family exchanges. The custody battle over 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez forced Americans to focus on Cuba for the first time in years, and many came to question the tactics of Cuban exile leaders, who have long had great influence over U.S.-Cuban relations. ``The people are way ahead of the politicians on this issue,'' said Sen. Byron L. Dorgan, D-N.D., who hopes to end the sanctions in the next Congress. Two powerful lobbies, the American Farm Bureau and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, are seeking to open up trade with Cuba. Leaders in both groups say they will press for what they say could represent a billion-dollar market for U.S. food products alone. Even some longtime supporters of sanctions see the change. ``The consensus has moved on U.S. policy toward Cuba,'' said Dan Fisk, a former Senate aide who was instrumental in drafting the 1996 Helms-Burton Act, which tightened the embargo, but is now a signatory on the council report. The next president will witness the dismantling of efforts to isolate Castro, Fisk predicted. Both Gov. George W. Bush and Vice President Al Gore oppose eliminating all sanctions against Cuba while Castro is in power, leaving many analysts to foresee a piecemeal approach. But economists in federal agencies like the Agriculture Department and the International Trade Commission are now working on studies that forecast the economic impact of lifting sanctions. Even among Cuban Americans, attitudes are changing. A majority favors selling food and medicine to Cuba, polls show, though most exiles voice support for the embargo. Elena Freyre, executive director of the Cuban Committee for Democracy, a liberal group, complained that exile lawmakers are out of step, catering only to the most intransigent, and best-financed, elements of the community. ``The people who purport to represent that community are no longer doing so,'' she said. But the battle must still be decided in Congress. In 1996, pro-embargo lawmakers _ nervous about President Bill Clinton's intentions _ stripped him of discretionary powers over the sanctions. Some seasoned political fighters stand in the way. Among them is DeLay. His antipathy stems in part, aides say, from a jarring incident when he was a boy: gun-toting Cuban troops boarded his airliner during a stopover in Havana on a flight from Venezuela to the United States. And there are the two Cuban-American lawmakers from Miami, Rep. Lincoln Diaz-Balart and Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, who seem unyielding when it comes to Castro. In a political system oiled by compromise, such fervor can bring the process to a halt. ``The leadership has made a mockery of the democratic process,'' said Wayne S. Smith, a former diplomat in Havana. ``For so long we have allowed our policy to be dictated from Miami against the will of a majority of the American people and a majority in Congress.'' Sanford said the Cuban exile lobby has kept lawmakers in line with generous campaign contributions. ``The answer, in part, is money,'' he said. ``I've had people tell me, `Hey, just take a quick trip to Miami and you're home $10,000 richer, in time for lunch.''' Pro-embargo Cuban exiles and their allies say they are taking a moral stand against a repressive regime. The Cuban American National Foundation, the leading exile lobby, asserts that Castro is working with American ``apologists'' and multinational firms to ``place tainted profits before principle.'' Yet with American business leaders vowing to revisit the policy, the deep-pocketed exile lobby may have met its match. Jack Laurie, vice president of the American Farm Bureau Federation, said his group will ultimately prevail. ``We probably didn't realize the intensity of feelings of Cuban Americans,'' he said. ``I'm sensitive to some of what they're saying. But by the same token, 40 years is a long time to harbor the same position.''

As concerns grow about the difficulty of finding an impartial jury for a major terrorism trial scheduled to start next month, the judge in the case says he plans to screen at least 1,500 people, one of the largest jury pools ever in a federal criminal case. The trial set to start on Jan. 3 in federal District Court in Manhattan involves four defendants indicted on charges that they participated in a global terrorism conspiracy that included the bombings of two U.S. Embassies in East Africa in 1998. More than 200 people were killed and thousands of others were injured in the two embassy blasts, which prosecutors say were organized by Osama bin Laden, who has been indicted in the bombings but remains a fugitive and is believed to be living in Afghanistan. The bombing suspects are being tried in New York because federal prosecutors in Manhattan were actively investigating bin Laden for other terrorism acts predating the embassy explosions. The authorities also are investigating whether bin Laden was involved in the bombing of the destroyer Cole in Yemen in October, which killed 17 Americans. The four defendants on trial in New York have not been accused of any role in that act. The decision to screen such a large pool of prospective jurors stems from concerns by the judge, Leonard B. Sand, and lawyers on both sides that publicity about the attacks and the continuing investigation of bin Laden's suspected involvement in other acts of terrorism will cause large numbers of people to be excused or removed from jury service. The trial needs 12 jurors and six alternates. It is also thought that many prospective jurors will be reluctant to serve because the trial is expected to last at least nine months, requiring them to seek extended leaves of absence from their jobs. Yet another reason for calling so many jurors is that two defendants face capital charges, the first federal death penalty case to go before a jury in Manhattan in nearly half a century. More prospective jurors are likely to be excused as lawyers for both sides petition Sand to drop them because of their views on the death penalty. The judge has indicated that all lawyers in the case must be sensitive to economic and personal hardships created by such a trial. ``In many areas, we are treading on new territory,'' Sand said in a recent hearing. ``We will be selecting a jury in a case that will take over nine months, which involves terrorism, which involves viewing perhaps pictures of blood and gore, and which involves the death penalty.'' He said it seemed likely that ``a large majority of those initially called will seek to be excused.'' A criminal defense lawyer who is not involved in the case, Gerald L. Shargel, observed, ``There's no question about the fact that this is going to be one of the most difficult jury selections in history.'' The case will be the fifth major terrorism trial held in New York in eight years, beginning with the trial in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing. None of the earlier trials, though, required such a large jury pool. Nor was the death penalty a factor. Lawyers say the largest pool was about 600 people who were screened for the 1995 trial of a group of men convicted of plotting to blow up the United Nations and other landmarks in New York.

When Slobodan Milosevic emerged in public last week, live and in color, to be re-elected president of his Socialist Party of Serbia, he sent a little shiver down a lot of spines. But Milosevic is today considered more of a spent force than a threat, less the evil plotter than someone who still doesn't understand quite what hit him on Sept. 24, when Serbs voted for Vojislav Kostunica and then banded together to pull down the old regime. Nonetheless, the Socialists are still expected to be the largest opposition party after Serbia's crucial elections on Dec. 23, getting up to 15 percent of the vote. But even senior U.S. officials believe that having Milosevic as its president will delay any revival of the party. In fact, Yugoslavia has moved to a new stage, with a new, hidden drama: the effort of Kostunica, the federal president, to translate his extraordinary popularity as a hero of democracy into enduring political power in Serbia, where real power lies. According to all the opinion polls, the 18-party coalition behind Kostunica should gain a big majority in the December voting. But it is a diverse bunch, and strains between Kostunica and his coalition ally and political rival, Zoran Djindjic, are expected to break the coalition apart within a year. Ever since the Serbs forced Milosevic to resign on Oct. 6, however, the West has been tripping over itself to help Kostunica and the prospect of a normal, benign Serbia. Western leaders have provided him quick emergency aid and swallowed any criticism of his performance. In Vienna, at last week's meeting of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, the slightly rumpled Kostunica was greeted like a star, with even Austria's Joerg Haider attending a lunch in his honor. But as Yugoslavia's federal president, Kostunica is formally in charge of the military, foreign relations and the air-traffic system, and not much else. The Serbian government controls most of everyday life, including the police (both secret and regular), and it is Djindjic, as the leader of the largest party in the coalition, who is expected to become Serbian prime minister. Kostunica has already succeeded in demanding the same number of seats on the coalition's parliamentary list for his once-marginal party as Djindjic will get for his much larger one. But Kostunica will be able only to influence events in Serbia, not control them. That is because Kostunica is the president of a legal entity, Yugoslavia, whose existence is something of a collective illusion, and whose main constituent parts are restive or in flux: _ Kosovo, the majority-Albanian province of Serbia run by the United Nations and NATO-led troops, is increasingly explosive, with armed Albanian militants infiltrating Serbia and killing policemen. _ Montenegro, Serbia's sister republic in Yugoslavia, is still pressing for independence despite Milosevic's fall, to the intense annoyance of the same West that backed Montenegro so lavishly when it seemed a little anti-Milosevic aircraft carrier. _ Serbia, with 95 percent of Yugoslavia's population, is being run by a shaky provisional government full of Milosevic supporters, which is why the elections matter so much. Washington and the West do not want what remains of Yugoslavia to fall apart. First, because it would leave Kostunica, whose probity has impressed them, essentially jobless. And second, because its further breakup would create new crises and expectations for independence in the region _ not just in Kosovo and Montenegro, but in the Republika Srpska (the Serb-dominated part of Bosnia-Herzegovina) and a deeply divided Macedonia. ``The battle to come is still Djindjic-Kostunica,'' said a senior European diplomat in Belgrade, where the parlor game is to guess along what lines the democratic coalition will split. ``Come January, with an active, functioning government in Serbia, Kostunica and the federal government are going to look very pale. A lot of the donor community, including governments, might prefer to deal with Djindjic.'' Djindjic is also a democrat with a history of opposition, so what's the problem? In fact, the two men distrust each other intensely, with the quiet, legally minded Kostunica regarding the elegant, entrepreneurial Djindjic as unreliable and even unscrupulous. That is a worry shared by many who admire Djindjic's organizational skills and who fear, along with Djindjic, that Kostunica is too professorial and indecisive, and has not moved quickly enough to dismantle the old regime. Aleksandar Tijanic, a slashing writer and analyst, summarizes the problem neatly, if a bit unfairly. ``Kostunica regards Parliament as a cathedral,'' Tijanic said. ``Djindjic regards it as a casino.'' For the moment, however, the test for Kostunica has been Kosovo, where Albanian militants in the Presevo Valley of Serbia have been trying to provoke him into overreacting with military force, as Milosevic did so often, undermining Belgrade's newly friendly relations with the West. Kostunica's enemies, like Milosevic, were quick to exploit the violence and call it a sign of Serbia's new weakness. Djindjic, too, unpopular for his ties to NATO countries in the Kosovo war, was quick to portray himself as a Serbian patriot, warning loudly that Serbia would defend itself. Kostunica understood he had to be seen to threaten force, but could not use it. So the army moved tanks to the border of the security zone from which the Kosovo peace agreement bans them and brought journalists down to film their resolve. Next, he tried to turn the crisis into a test for the West. In Vienna, he criticized NATO and the United Nations for failing to do their job in Kosovo while urging them to seal the border. NATO and Western officials, eager to help him and nervous about renewed Albanian militancy, promised a new crackdown. Even Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright, whom Serbs regard as the champion of the bombing campaign against them, a campaign Kostunica opposed, praised him. She assured his foreign minister that U.S. forces would do all they could to rein in the very fighters they called allies less than a year ago in Kosovo. ``Everyone wants to get Kostunica and the democrats past this election,'' a senior Western official said. ``If anyone says they're thinking much beyond Dec. 23, they're lying.''

In an era when an American president beguiles crowds in Vietnam, and China is a key trading partner, U.S. policy-makers still need to be reminded of their victory over communism when talk turns to Cuba. Cuba's transition to a free-market democracy is inevitable, a bipartisan task force of the Council on Foreign Relations declared in a report issued Wednesday. The committee asserted that the United States should move faster to open and increase a variety of contacts. Yet whenever Washington focuses on that nearby island with 11 million people, peculiar things happen. Reason slips, tempers flare. And the custodians of the current hard-line policy are out of sync with the general public, which increasingly favors a less hostile stance toward Havana. In October, Republican leaders stymied votes in both houses to open Cuba to more trade and travel. The bill finally signed by the president legalized the sale of food but denied vital funding; rather than increase travel, it froze current restrictions by codifying them into law. Rep. Mark Sanford, R-S.C., got a taste of the Cuba warp last summer, when he had won broad support for a measure to let Americans visit the island freely. After the vote, he sought to clear the air with his long-time ally, Tom DeLay, the Republican whip, who remains an ardent foe of any softening toward Havana. What he got was a nasty fight. The two men turned red in the face as they screamed at each other. The spectacle on the House floor left staffers awkwardly staring at their shoes. Later, in conference, DeLay helped kill Sanford's bill. After four decades of seeking to topple, discredit and isolate the Cuban leader, Fidel Castro, the defense of the current U.S. policy increasingly relies on strong-arm tactics and back-room deals. Meanwhile, surveys show most Americans want a new approach. They want more interaction and trade. A recent poll by Florida International University found 80 percent of Americans would support a dialogue with the Cuban government. They favor the sale of food (86 percent) and medicine (90 percent). A key recommendation by the council task force urged opening Cuba to travel by all Americans. Some people aren't waiting on Washington. Though officially barred from spending money in Cuba, an estimated 22,000 Americans illegally flew in as tourists from third countries last year. An additional 135,000 took part in authorized visits for academic, cultural and family exchanges. The custody battle over 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez forced Americans to focus on Cuba for the first time in years, and many came to question the tactics of Cuban exile leaders, who have long had great influence over U.S.-Cuban relations. ``The people are way ahead of the politicians on this issue,'' said Sen. Byron L. Dorgan, D-N.D., who hopes to end the sanctions in the next Congress. Two powerful lobbies, the American Farm Bureau and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, are seeking to open up trade with Cuba. Leaders in both groups say they will press for what they say could represent a billion-dollar market for U.S. food products alone. Even some longtime supporters of sanctions see the change. ``The consensus has moved on U.S. policy toward Cuba,'' said Dan Fisk, a former Senate aide who was instrumental in drafting the 1996 Helms-Burton Act, which tightened the embargo, but is now a signatory on the council report. The next president will witness the dismantling of efforts to isolate Castro, Fisk predicted. Both Gov. George W. Bush and Vice President Al Gore oppose eliminating all sanctions against Cuba while Castro is in power, leaving many analysts to foresee a piecemeal approach. But economists in federal agencies like the Agriculture Department and the International Trade Commission are now working on studies that forecast the economic impact of lifting sanctions. Even among Cuban Americans, attitudes are changing. A majority favors selling food and medicine to Cuba, polls show, though most exiles voice support for the embargo. Elena Freyre, executive director of the Cuban Committee for Democracy, a liberal group, complained that exile lawmakers are out of step, catering only to the most intransigent, and best-financed, elements of the community. ``The people who purport to represent that community are no longer doing so,'' she said. But the battle must still be decided in Congress. In 1996, pro-embargo lawmakers _ nervous about President Bill Clinton's intentions _ stripped him of discretionary powers over the sanctions. Some seasoned political fighters stand in the way. Among them is DeLay. His antipathy stems in part, aides say, from a jarring incident when he was a boy: gun-toting Cuban troops boarded his airliner during a stopover in Havana on a flight from Venezuela to the United States. And there are the two Cuban-American lawmakers from Miami, Rep. Lincoln Diaz-Balart and Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, who seem unyielding when it comes to Castro. In a political system oiled by compromise, such fervor can bring the process to a halt. ``The leadership has made a mockery of the democratic process,'' said Wayne S. Smith, a former diplomat in Havana. ``For so long we have allowed our policy to be dictated from Miami against the will of a majority of the American people and a majority in Congress.'' Sanford said the Cuban exile lobby has kept lawmakers in line with generous campaign contributions. ``The answer, in part, is money,'' he said. ``I've had people tell me, `Hey, just take a quick trip to Miami and you're home $10,000 richer, in time for lunch.''' Pro-embargo Cuban exiles and their allies say they are taking a moral stand against a repressive regime. The Cuban American National Foundation, the leading exile lobby, asserts that Castro is working with American ``apologists'' and multinational firms to ``place tainted profits before principle.'' Yet with American business leaders vowing to revisit the policy, the deep-pocketed exile lobby may have met its match. Jack Laurie, vice president of the American Farm Bureau Federation, said his group will ultimately prevail. ``We probably didn't realize the intensity of feelings of Cuban Americans,'' he said. ``I'm sensitive to some of what they're saying. But by the same token, 40 years is a long time to harbor the same position.''

Eritrea and Ethiopia have reached a deal that would end a two-year border war that has cost tens of thousands of lives on both sides, officials from both sides said Monday. The countries will sign a treaty Dec. 12 in Algiers, said Yemane Gebremeskel, a spokesman for Eritrean President Isaias Afwerki. Afwerki received a formal invitation over the weekend from Algerian President Abdelaziz Bouteflika to attend the signing ceremony, Gebremeskel said by telephone from the Eritrean capital, Asmara. In the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa, spokeswoman Selome Taddesse said the government had accepted Bouteflika's invitation to send a delegation to Algiers. She said a draft agreement proposed by the Organization of African Unity would first be presented to the Ethiopian parliament Thursday for discussion. Ethiopian and Eritrean military officers met over the weekend in Nairobi with officials of the 4,500-strong U.N. peacekeeping mission that is deploying along the border between the two countries in the Horn of Africa. U.N. spokesman Brian Kelly, who is based in Asmara, said the Ethiopian and Eritrean commanders had agreed to reopen two additional border crossings, one to the south near the Red Sea port of Assab and the other along the Shambiko-Sheraro road in western Eritrea. Last week the U.N. Mission to Ethiopia and Eritrea opened the first border crossing at the Senafe-Adigrat front, about 60 miles south of Asmara. U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan is scheduled to visit Ethiopia and Eritrea later this week to review the peacekeeping operation. The war over the 620-mile border broke out in May 1998 when Eritrea, which had gained independence from Ethiopia five years earlier after three decades of guerrilla warfare, moved into what Ethiopians considered their territory. The border between Eritrea, a Pennsylvania-sized country on the Red Sea coast, and Ethiopia, its much larger landlocked neighbor to the south, has never been formally outlined. The border war intensified after Ethiopia launched a sweeping offensive into Eritrean territory last May, forcing some 1 million Eritreans to flee at a time when a regional drought threatened hundreds of thousands of lives. According to estimates from both sides, some 10,000 people died in the fighting. The two countries signed an agreement to a cease hostilities in June, in Algiers. Algeria, the Organization of African Unity and President Clinton's special envoy, Anthony Lake, have been mediating peace talks. Gebremeskel said the Eritreans were satisfied that there were adequate provisions in the agreement to investigate the causes of the war, to formally mark the border and to establish a commission to hear claims for compensation for war damages.

The wife of a U.S. businessman being tried on Russian espionage charges said Tuesday there was no hope for an acquittal and pledged to carry on efforts to free her husband from a Moscow jail. Cheri Pope arrived in Moscow on Monday to support her husband Edmond through the last days of his trial. Pope is scheduled to deliver his closing defense argument on Wednesday, and a verdict is expected soon afterward. ``I am bracing myself for him to be found guilty,'' Cheri Pope said outside the Lefortovo Prison, where she was to be allowed a rare, hourlong visit with her husband. ``I'm going to have to sit there and listen to my husband be sentenced to the maximum penalty and proceed from there. I'm not going to give up and I'm not going to go away,'' she said. It was only her fourth visit with Pope since he was arrested in April and imprisoned on charges of obtaining classified blueprints for a high-speed torpedo. The trial judge turned down Cheri Pope's request to see her husband again on Thursday, the latest in a string of rejections, but she will be allowed to attend the reading of the verdict. ``One hour every two months is not enough,'' protested Rep. John Peterson of Pennsylvania, who accompanied Cheri Pope to Moscow. ``He is shut off from his family and the whole world. ... His life stopped 245 days ago.'' Prosecutors in the closed-door trial have demanded the maximum sentence of 20 years in prison, and payment of a staggering $250 million for damages to Russia's defense industry. Pope's family and defense lawyers have accused the judge of bias, and they have expressed only pessimism about the trial's possible outcome. The defense contends that the torpedo blueprints had already been sold abroad and published in open sources. And Pope's main accuser has recanted his testimony. Washington has urged Russia to release Pope, partly because he is in poor health. Pope has suffered from bone cancer, which was in remission when he came to Moscow but which his family fears may have returned. Cheri Pope said after seeing her husband Tuesday that she was shocked at his condition. He is ``a sick man and he needs medical care now. Not a week from now, not a month from now,'' she said. During the seven-week trial, Pope has suffered from attacks of sharp pain, and he has been permitted to sit during the hearings rather than standing as prisoners usually do. However, the judge has turned down repeated defense requests for an independent medical evaluation by English-speaking doctors. Pope, 54, is a retired U.S. Navy officer and founder of CERF Technologies International, a company specializing in studying foreign maritime equipment.

another senior politician has a new part tonight. former president george bush underwent hip replacement surgery at the mayo clinic in rochester, minnesota. as nbc's chief science correspondent robert bazell reports, the former president is an active man and this new hip should only help, not hinder, his lifestyle. the former president playing tennis just last sunday in a celebrity match, joining chris evert to actually defeat regis philbin and jim courier. today a hip replacement, experts say, for a 76-year-old as tough and active as mr. bush, the prospects for full recovery are excellent. for someone who is otherwise healthy who has arthritis of the hip, it is a very safe operation. bernard rothman, a new york lawyer, had a left hip replacement like bush last july. i find that the quality of life that i have at the present time has essentially gone back to the quality of life i had before the hip replacement, before all the problems started. in the surgery, doctors implant a socket device into the pelvis and a matching ball joint at the top of the leg bone. surgeons in the country implant 150,000 of these artificial hips every year. the operation costs about $25,000, and the joints typically last 10 to 20 years. that is not long enough for a lot of people who get the hips these days who want to stay active, like former president bush, well into their 70s and beyond. the average age for people getting hip replacement is 68, and many younger people get them. there are some people who are in the 50s who will get this arthritis that most of us think our grandparents had in the 80s and 90s. that's why labs like this one at the university of california berkeley are working to find longer lasting materials. researchers examine joints that do wear out and test new materials like ceramics to replace the metal and plastics that make up the joints now. this machine emulates 1 million human steps a year. to try to maximize the artificial joints' lifetime, doctors recommend against high-impact sports, like running, but lots of physical activity is fine. walking, swimming, playing golf. even a doubles tennis match is okay, and doctors say mr. bush's game could get even better with his new hip. robert bazell, nbc news, san francisco. of course, it doesn't hurt to have chris evert on your side of the net as well.

When Corneliu Vadim Tudor announced he was running for president, many considered it a joke. They've stopped laughing. The ultranationalist firebrand with a history of vituperative attacks on enemies real and perceived _ Jews, Hungarians, Gypsies, political rivals _ finished second with 28 percent of the vote in the first round of presidential elections Nov. 26. He faces front-runner Ion Iliescu, a former president, in a runoff Sunday. The prospect of Iliescu as president worried many Romanians, who feared that an ex-communist at the helm would hurt the country's chances of joining the European Union. But if an Iliescu presidency is worrisome, the idea of a Tudor victory provokes outright alarm among Romania's elite. ``A Tudor victory would be a catastrophe,'' Stelian Tanase, a political commentator, said in an interview. ``Romania needs serious politicians with platforms to take us into Europe and Vadim is the opposite to all these.'' Silviu Brucan, a retired diplomat and leader of the 1989 anti-communist revolution, said a Tudor victory would mean ``Romania is doomed to become a poor and undeveloped island in Europe.'' Brucan, 80, has himself been targeted by Tudor, whose weekly magazine, Greater Romania, regularly describes him as the ``terrorist Jew who praised Stalin.'' Pollsters have stopped publishing soundings since the Nov. 26 election that thrust Tudor to prominence. Some of them say privately that they don't want to influence what could be a fateful outcome for their country. Tudor and Iliescu will not meet for televised debates, and Tudor has claimed that no television station will let him appear this week. Newspapers are either ridiculing or ignoring him. Although Tudor's style would relegate him to fringe status in the West, it clearly scores among Romanians, which says much about their society 11 years after the collapse of communism. The public has grown profoundly cynical about poverty, double-digit inflation and corruption, for which few public figures have been punished. Beyond playing on traditional prejudices, Tudor, 51, shrewdly tapped public frustration by his promises to restore law and order and go after those responsible for the rot. His rise is all the more spectacular, considering that he was known as court poet to the late dictator Nicolae Ceausescu. But months after Ceausescu's execution in 1989, Tudor was back with a flourish. Exploiting centuries-old hatreds, his anti-Semitic and anti-Hungarian Greater Romania party found its niche among a people who feel consider themselves hemmed in by hostile Hungarians, Turks and Slavs. Tudor was elected to the Senate in 1992 and has remained there despite hundreds of libel cases pending against him. In recent interviews, Tudor has insisted he is neither racist nor anti-Semitic, and his campaign has avoided attacks on Jews. Still, his words paint a different picture. In a poem written in 1992 about Rabbi Moses Rosen, the late leader of Romania's Jewish community, Tudor railed: ``Rabbi, Rabbi, with your curly beard With your hair full of dandruff ... Rabbi, Rabbi, you old horse You ragged old man with a weak mind You spit on sacred Romanian things Rabbi, Rabbi, you sold us to the Hungarians and the Russians'' Another poem ridiculed former Prime Minister Victor Ciorbea: ``I have a dream To kill Ciorbea Hurrah my dear Let me kill the Short Sighted One!'' The poem went on to vilify Ciorbea as a ``thief'' with syphilis. Tudor remained a fringe figure until the 1990s; in the 1996 presidential election, he got less than 5 percent of the vote in a contest won by Emil Constantinescu. However, as Constantinescu's administration failed to revive the economy or curb corruption, Tudor's appeal grew. His following expanded with quick-fix solutions: to eradicate the ``Gypsy mafia'' supposedly running the country and to stamp out corruption with ``an iron hand.'' ``His message is OK _ that is exactly what we need, to get rid of the Gypsy mafia,'' said hotel owner Emanuela Nicolaide. The square-jawed, folksy politician can recite Byron with one breath and let loose with below-the-belt invective with the next. He uses earthy vernacular couched in perfect grammar. The youngest of five children of a Bucharest tailor, Tudor is a product of the communist system that offered advancement to bright blue-collar youths. He was nurtured by writer Eugen Barbu, went to Vienna to study history and traveled with the national soccer team. Tudor now says he regrets some of his earlier writings _ but in terminology that occasionally betrays him. He boasts that he feeds elderly Jews at weekly ``Christian suppers,'' but then mentions that he also feeds 15 stray dogs. He wears flashy sunglasses, chunky gold cufflinks, and white suits on particularly ceremonious occasions, because ``White is the color of truth. In all the images of Jesus Christ, he appears in white.'' Of late, Tudor seems to be toning down his image. Since Nov. 26, he has had only two news conferences, appearing without sunglasses or white suits. At one, he read a letter he wrote to George W. Bush. ``Americans have come to understand that defending authentic values and the advantages of democracies requires a radical position,'' he said. His supporters loudly approve. ``I voted for Vlad the Impaler,'' said Ion Palajean, a plumber from Cluj, referring to the 15th-century prince who impaled thieves and invading Turks. ``Only Vadim can do something. ``At least he might imprison the thieves who sold our factories, pocketed the money and left us without jobs.''

The low point came last summer when President Vladimir Putin witnessed Russia's Olympic gold medalists standing in awkward silence on the victory stands of Sydney as their national anthem rumbled out of the loudspeakers. If, to some, they appeared at a loss for words, it was for good reason. The Russian state anthem has no words. Since 1990, when President Boris Yeltsin decreed that a score by the 19th-century composer Mikhail Glinka should become Russia's ``Patriotic Song,'' there have been nothing but complaints that the country has lost its voice. Many Russians profess they cannot even hum the tune without a musical prompt. The indignity of having no national song to sing extends beyond the athletes to schoolchildren, soldiers, veterans and those who have done battle on every soccer field in Europe. So when other nations hear their national equivalent of ``Oh say can you see...,'' these Russians watch as their homeland is revealed as a country still without lyrics a decade after the fall of communism. This week, the 48-year-old Putin marched onto this battlefield of national identity with a proposal to bring back the Soviet national anthem _ with new lyrics yet to be written _ along with the Soviet Red Banner as the official ensign of the Russian armed forces. The Russian parliament, where Putin continues to hold together a majority of communists and market reformers, will vote on the measure Friday. Many deputies on Tuesday predicted quick passage. In a televised address to the nation Monday evening, Putin said: ``If we agree that the symbols of the preceding epochs, including the Soviet epoch, must not be used at all, we will have to admit then that our mothers' and fathers' lives were useless and meaningless, that their lives were in vain. Neither in my head nor in my heart can I agree with this.'' Putin told the country that Russia's current flag, the 300-year-old imperial tricolor flag of white, blue and red rehabilitated by Yeltsin, will remain as the state flag. And the double-headed eagle that was resurrected as Russia's national seal in Yeltsin's time will also remain as a 500-year-old symbol of the Russian state. But Putin told a divided nation in the televised address on Monday that it is time for Russians to embrace all of the symbols of their past, including the hallmarks of the Soviet empire. Guided by opinion polls, he said he would restore the Soviet anthem along with a red banner for the armed forces symbolizing the victory of Soviet forces in the Great Patriotic War, as many Russians call World War II. (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) At first blush, Putin's proposal appeared to be a forced marriage between the most prominent of Russia's czarist and Soviet symbols. He said he had acted after consulting a number of public opinion polls and after months of televised debates and auditions by pop divas and cultural patriots. But instead of striking the intended chord of compromise in a nation still divided between those who harken to the Soviet era and those who would like to bury it and move on, Putin has set off a tempest. (END OPTIONAL TRIM) Now many Russians fear they may never hear the end of their own national argument about who they are. ``A historic mistake,'' said Anatoly Chubais, a leading democratic reformer of the Yeltsin era who now runs Russia's electric power monopoly, United Energy Systems. ``The president is not the main sociologist, his task is not to repeat what the people say, but to actively influence society's position. The truth is not determined by the majority. The majority, as we well know from our history, has supported lies, injustice and great bloodshed.'' Putin's minister of culture, Mikhail Shvydkoi, called it ``nonsense'' to bring back the trappings of the Soviet state after Yeltsin effectively locked them away in favor of the icons of Russia's pre-revolutionary empire. In the newspaper Izvestia on Tuesday,21 prominent intellectuals and cultural figures condemned Putin's move, predicting it would split the nation and encourage those nationalists ``who dream of avenging the decade of Russia's renewal'' by giving them ``an emblem of revenge.'' Thus, ``It is dangerous to revive ghosts.'' (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) They warned him that the music of the Soviet-era anthem, with its unforgettable refrain, ``Oh Party of Lenin, the strength of the people, to communism's triumph lead us on,'' represents ``one of the most striking symbols of the bygone epoch, and no new lyrics will be able to erase the words attached to it that forever glorify Lenin and Stalin.'' (END OPTIONAL TRIM) But Putin countered, ``Is there nothing good to remember about the Soviet period of our country?'' He acknowledged that many Russians are still alive ``who have personally experienced all the horrors of Stalin's prison camps,'' but he added, ``Was there nothing but Stalin's prison camps and repression?'' What about the achievements of Soviet science, of the spectacular space flight of Cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin, of the art and music of cultural heroes like composer Dimitri Shostakovich. ``I think that if we ponder all this, we will recognize that we not only can but must use all the main symbols of our state today.'' And he reminded Russians that the glory of the czarist past, whose symbols have mostly supplanted Soviet ones, was not so glorious since the Russia of the Romanov dynasty ``not for nothing'' was called ``a prison of the peoples, a country which had repressed peoples and dissidents of its own.'' But many liberal intellectuals remain unconvinced, and many are appalled. The liberal leader of the Yabloko Party, Grigory Yavlinsky, said he spent three hours on Tuesday in the Kremlin trying to persuade Putin to withdraw his proposal. The Soviet anthem by Alexander Alexandrov, Yavlinsky said, ``is the music of the Bolshevik Party, symbolizing Stalin's period in our history.'' But not all liberals agreed. Sergei Markov, a respected political commentator, said, ``The country is putting an end to setting off communists against anti-communists; it is tackling other more vital problems.'' He said liberals offended by Putin's genuflections to the Soviet era should ``realize that communism has already receded into the past and does not pose a threat to the country.'' With approval ratings still soaring at around 69 percent, Putin has already demonstrated that he has been able to straddle the Soviet-post-Soviet divide more skillfully than his predecessor. But getting the country to agree to a Russified Soviet anthem that was written for Stalin will certainly test those skills. ``I admit that the people and myself may be committing an error,'' Putin said Monday night, calling on critics of the decision ``not to dramatize events, put up insurmountable barriers, burn any bridges or split society once again.'' It may turn out that if the Soviet anthem is accepted, the words will be provided by Stalin's own hymn writer, Sergei Mikhalkov, now 87. Having written the words to the Soviet anthem as a young man, he was asked this fall to provide a new set of lyrics, dropping all references to Leninist glories and replacing them with lines like, ``The Russian eagle soars in the heights; The glorious tricolor, symbol of the Fatherland; Leads Russia's peoples onward to victory.'' On Tuesday, Mikhalkov was said to be ``indifferent'' to the outcome of the competition, according to his son, Nikita, the filmmaker. ``He's 87 years old, he's not at that age when one should be worried about such things,'' he said.

A Moscow court on Wednesday gave the maximum sentence of 20 years at hard labor to Edmond Pope, a former U.S. naval intelligence officer accused of trying to acquire technology for a rocket-propelled torpedo. The verdict was read by Judge Nina Barkova as Pope stood in a steel cage, holding hands through the bars with his wife, Cheri. He shook his head in disbelief as the judge read out her reasons for handing down the maximum sentence. Pope's attorney, Pavel Astakhov, denounced the verdict as unfair and a throwback to the Stalinist era. He said he had seven days to file an appeal. He said he could not comment yet on whether President Vladimir Putin would consider releasing Pope for health reasons and allow him to return to the United States. Pope has a rare form of bone cancer that has gone into remission, but his family believes he is seriously ill from the effects of 246 days of confinement at Lefortovo Prison. Pope, a businessman, was arrested in April in the midst of a transaction to acquire technological reports about Russia's superfast Shkval torpedo, a rocket-propelled torpedo that travels 230 mph underwater. The technology represented a significant advance in submarine warfare. No similar weapon exists in Western navies, experts said. The first intelligence about the torpedo and its use on nuclear-powered submarines became public after the fall of the Soviet Union. The torpedo was taken out of service after that, but updated models have been tested in the last few years, and the military competition apparently continues. For Washington and Moscow, the Pope case has become an uncomfortable throwback to a Cold War-era of spy rivalry at a time when Russia and the United States profess that there is no longer such competition. The trial began on Oct. 18 under protest from the United States. Astakhov introduced documents that he said showed that Pope and a professor at Bauman State Technical University, Anatoly Babkin, had been trading unclassified information about torpedo technology when they were both arrested in April.

A court in Moscow has convicted American businessman Edmund Pope of spying and sentenced him to 20 years in prison. Pope, a retired naval officer from Pennsylvania, was accused of illegally obtaining secret blueprints for a high speed Russian torpedo. He argued throughout the case that the information he obtained was already available to the public. The White House denounced the court action calling it unjustified and wrong. Pope's wife and his lawyers have also called for his release on health grounds, saying that he suffers from a rare form of bone cancer, which may have returned during his eight months in a Russian prison.

A court in Moscow today sentenced American businessman Edmund Pope to 20 years in jail. Pope, a former naval officer, was found guilty of collecting secret blueprints for a high speed Russian torpedo. Pope denied the charges and he had a powerful ally. President Clinton had appealed for clemency for Pope on health grounds and had brought the case up with Russian President Vladimir Putin, but Mr. Clinton's pleas apparently fell on deaf ears. The Russian court today handed down the maximum sentence. Still, The World's Nenad Chebeck in Moscow says that Pope has not yet exhausted his legal options. He has got 7 days to appeal this particular sentence. There is also the possibility of asking for a presidential pardon, Pope has actually indeed already done that. It's just that his wife said that she has not heard neither from the President nor his office. His health is a big issue as well, isn't it? Yes, Pope has been suffering from a rare bone cancer in the past and he has been consistently complaining about his health ever since last Spring when he was taken in to the Lefortovo prison. The thing is that he has not been allowed any access to American doctors and even to Russian doctors of his own choosing. He has been examined by the Russian doctors in the Lefortovo prison but they have just said that his complaints are unfounded and that it might be a case of severe rheumatism or something like that. They are not sort of allowing the possibility of his bone cancer reoccurring. One of the things that has been said here is that Mr. Pope may have run afoul of a changing mood in Russia about what kind of military and security information might be made available to the west for business purposes. That his intentions were innocent to begin with, but the times changed and what he did began to look more and more like espionage. That is certainly a possibility but we don't know actually precisely because we don't even know what the initial charges are. The whole trial was held behind closed doors and the details of the accusations against Pope have never been fully released. We know that the prosecution claimed that he was trying to purchase secret plans for a top-secret high-speed Russian torpedo. He was claiming all the time, and his lawyer was saying that he was sort of trying to purchase plans that had been actually out in the open but we do not know the precise legals of that. That is one of the possibilities. Another thing which is mentioned here is that Pope simply ran afoul of a new trend in Russia which was a trend where the security services were getting the upper hand where they were trying to prove that they are actually doing their job, that they are catching spies, that they are getting convictions. We have, for example, today's reaction by General Alexander Danewich, he is the head of the FSB support programs. He was very, very brief in his comments after the sentencing. He said that the court has said that FSB investigators have acted correctly and in accordance with the law and he says, "Russia has its secrets, we will do our best to protect them". May be Pope simply ran afoul of such attempts by the Russian Security Services to show that they are doing their job. Putin, on the one hand, is certainly trying to show that he is in charge and that no one from the outside is going to get away with anything. By the same token though he is not eager to run afoul of the United States and the State Department is very upset. Is there any possibility that Mr. Putin might consider a pardon? I would say there is a very strong possibility of that. We know that President Clinton has spoken to Vladimir Putin about this when they met last time, and certainly the Secretary of State Madeleine Albright has brought up the issue a number of times, as has the State Department indeed with the Russian Foreign Ministry. In a curious way the sentencing of Edmund Pope might be the beginning of an end of this ordeal for him. Because now that there is a sentence, once the judiciary process is started, once the FSB brought him to trial everybody here expected that the trial will end and that it will end with a conviction. But now that this judicial process is over there is a very, very strong likelihood, that's the feeling here in Moscow that President Vladimir Putin might pardon Edmund Pope. There is a good reason for that, his ill health. So it would be a nice humanitarian gesture and a way of offering a friendly hand to the west and to the United States in particular. The World's Nenad Sebek in Moscow. Thanks a lot, Nenad. You are welcome.

The White House criticized as ``unjustified and wrong'' a Russian court's conviction Wednesday of American businessman Edmond Pope on charges of illegally obtaining classified blueprints for a high-speed torpedo. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright telephoned Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov to stress U.S. concern over Pope's heath and to urge his release from prison, said a State Department spokesman, Philip Reeker, who would not disclose Ivanov's response. At the White House, spokesman Jake Siewert demanded Pope's release on humanitarian grounds _ he is believed to be suffering from a rare form of bone cancer. ``There's no doubt'' the case has cast a shadow over U.S.-Russian relations, Siewert said. ``We will continue to pursue a multifaceted relationship with Russia based on what we think is in America's long-term strategic interest,'' Siewert said. The 54-year-old Pope, a retired U.S. Navy officer, was sentenced to 20 years in prison. Members of Congress urged President Clinton to press Russian President Vladimir Putin to intercede and gain Pope's release. ``The president has expressed his concern about Mr. Pope on a number of levels,'' Siewert said. ``We think he hasn't had proper medical care there _ that it's important that the Russian government recognize on humanitarian grounds that he should be allowed to return to the United States and receive proper medical care,'' Siewert said. On Capitol Hill, Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., urged Clinton to contact Putin and demand Pope's safe return to his family in State College, Pa. ``His health has visibly deteriorated possibly due to a recurrence of a very rare form of bone cancer,'' Specter wrote. His letter said Pope had pursued technology that is commercially available and advertised for sale by Russian authorities. Rep. Greg Walden, R-Ore., said the sentence was ``an inexcusable travesty of justice'' and that if Russia forces Pope ``to serve prison time for a crime he did not commit, that country's relationship with the U.S. will be forever scarred.'' Sen. Gordon H. Smith, R-Ore., said the verdict was ``another sign that Russia lacks the basic legal protections necessary if it is to shed its reputation as a `thugocracy,''' Clinton and his administration were accused by Rep. Curt Weldon, R-Pa., of not doing enough for Pope. ``They let him languish for months and didn't demand to free this innocent man,'' he said. All along, the State Department had insisted the charges should be dropped, cited Pope's health and criticized Russian officials for giving U.S. diplomats and an American physician only limited access to the prisoner. If Pope is not released promptly, the conviction is bound to be on Albright's agenda when she meets later this month with Ivanov in Belgium. Pope, on trial since Oct. 18, insisted on his innocence. He contended that the torpedo plans were not secret because they had been sold abroad and published. U.S. relations with Moscow have slumped even as the two countries collaborated in trying to compel the Taliban group that controls most of Afghanistan to hand over Osama bin Laden for trial in the United States on terrorism charges. On Tuesday, State Department spokesman Richard Boucher criticized a Russian decision to exempt residents of breakaway regions of Georgia from rules tightening the issuance of visas for Georgians to enter Russia. Last week, the State Department made public a Russian decision to terminate a 5-year-old pledge to halt sales of tanks and other battlefield equipment to Iran. The pledge was terminated Friday, but this week Boucher said there was no evidence Russia had resumed arms sales to Iran. A U.S. delegation was sent this week to Moscow to ask for a reversal. ___ On the Net: State Department site: http://www.state.gov

With the sun beating down, long lines of laughing, jostling voters formed at ballot stations in presidential elections Thursday that mark the end of an era for this West African nation. For two decades, a charismatic ex-fighter pilot who staged two coups and led a brutal military government before embracing democratic ideals, has embodied Ghana's government. But President Jerry Rawlings is barred by the constitution from running for another four-year term. His willingness to step down after 19 years in office is a rare commitment to democratic change in a region characterized by repressive leaders and flawed elections. ``This time round there is going to be a change,'' said Frank Kyere, a student who lined up with about 200 people to cast his ballot at the University of Ghana campus in Accra. ``It's a great feeling.'' With Rawlings out of the contest, opposition parties hoped to wrest power Thursday from the ruling National Democratic Congress. Rawlings' vice president and hoped-for successor, John Atta Mills, was vying against six opponents. The most prominent was John Agyekum Kuffuor, a British-trained lawyer who came second in 1996 elections. Kuffuor has campaigned on a platform of ``positive change,'' arguing the country has remained too long in the hands of a regime that, despite its popularity, is often accused of corruption and human rights abuses. Mills, however, said he was ``extremely confident'' of victory, when he cast his ballot at the university. ``I think we have done all that we can to build a good democracy, and now it is the responsibility of all to build on it,'' Mills said. Despite support from his mentor, Mills' chances of victory have been hurt by a decline in the once-thriving economy. Ghana has been hit in recent years by plummeting international prices for the country's major exports, cocoa and gold, and by oil price hikes. The national currency, the cedi, has depreciated by over 50 percent in the past year. Observers said none of the candidates were likely to win the 50 percent of the vote required for an outright win, and a second round of balloting was likely. Nearly 11 million voters were registered for Thursday's poll, in which representatives to the country's 200-seat parliament were also being selected. Campaigning was marred by scattered clashes between Mills' supporters and backers of other parties in which at least one person was killed last month. But there were no immediate reports of unrest Thursday. The vote was being overseen by a national electoral commission, which _ unusual in West Africa _ is considered genuinely independent. Rawlings appealed for a peaceful and fair vote in a national address on the eve of the election. Ghana, which has experienced five military regimes since independence from Britain in 1957, has evolved under Rawlings, its longest-serving leader, blossoming into a multiparty nation with a flourishing independent press. Rawlings first took power in a 1979 coup, handing over control briefly to a civilian leader, before a second coup two years later. He was first elected president in flawed 1992 voting, but won more than 55 percent support in a widely praised 1996 ballot. With his colorful personality, passionate speeches and trademark dark glasses, Rawlings will be a hard act to follow. He plans to hand over to his successor on Jan. 7.

MOSCOW (AP) _ U.S. businessman Edmond Pope, convicted of espionage in Russia, asked President Vladimir Putin to pardon him Thursday, and a presidential commission was set to hear his request, Putin's press service said. Pope was convicted Wednesday and sentenced to 20 years in a maximum-security prison by a court widely criticized as being biased. The president's pardon commission is to consider Pope's appeal of the verdict on Friday morning, the press service said. Pope's lawyer, Pavel Astakhov, had earlier called on Putin to release the businessman from Pennsylvania, and suggested Washington push for his freedom. Putin would have ``no choice'' but to pardon Pope if President Clinton appealed for clemency, Astakhov said. ``And in this case, the U.S. president has already repeatedly made such a request. If it's formulated as a petition for clemency, then the international practice, principles and the laws of diplomacy, as you will, leave no choice for our political leaders,'' Astakhov told The Associated Press. Pope's wife Cheri spent the day meeting with the U.S. ambassador to Moscow, James Collins, and other embassy officials. She said that her request to see her husband had been turned down, and that she had not had a chance to discuss his next steps with him. ``I don't really understand the Russian judicial system,'' Cheri Pope said Thursday. ``I still don't know what the charges were.'' She said she had requested an English translation of the verdict and was told that it would take three to six days to prepare. Pope, a retired U.S. Navy officer, was convicted of illegally obtaining classified blueprints of a high-speed underwater torpedo, the Shkval. Ever since his April 3 arrest, he has insisted on his innocence, saying that the plans were not secret because they had already been sold abroad and were published in open sources. Pope and his family maintain he should be freed because of poor health. He has suffered from a rare form of bone cancer, which was in remission when he traveled to Russia this year, but his family fears it may have returned. Cheri Pope said her husband also suffers from high blood pressure, and he had trouble talking and writing notes during an hour-long meeting at the prison earlier this week. She said her efforts to win her husband's freedom wouldn't stop. ``Every day I try to talk to someone that I think can help,'' she said. But she has also concentrated on offering support to other members of the Pope family. ``Our family is devastated. Ed's Mom, I can't talk to her without her crying, and we cry together. It's been very, very difficult,'' she said. Pope is the first U.S. citizen to be convicted of espionage in Russia since U2 pilot Francis Gary Powers was shot down in 1960. He was exchanged for a Soviet spy convicted in the United States. Pope, 54, of State College, Pa., is the founder of CERF Technologies International, a company specializing in studying foreign maritime equipment.

Airline pilots from 30 countries may boycott Taiwan's airspace unless the pilots of a Singapore Airlines flight that crashed on takeoff five weeks ago are allowed to go home, a pilots' group leader said Thursday. The International Federation of Airline Pilots Associations believes the three Singapore Airlines pilots are being treated like criminals, said Capt. Ryan Goh, president of the federation's Singapore chapter. He said flight commander Capt. Foong Chee Kong, 41, a Malaysian, and Singaporean co-pilots Latif Cyrano, 36, and Ng Kheng Leng, 38, ``have been through hell and back'' and that they should be allowed to recover with their families in Singapore. The pilots were ordered to stay in Taiwan after their jetliner crashed while trying to take off from the wrong runway in Taipei on Oct. 31, killing 83 of the 179 people aboard. Most of the passengers who died were either American or Taiwanese. The pilots are not in jail but are being prevented from going home and their movements are restricted, Goh said. Taiwanese officials have said the pilots should stay to help with the inquiry into the crash, but Goh said the men have only been interviewed once in the last 20 days. In Taiwan, Taoyuan district chief prosecutor Song Keo-yeh declined to say when the pilots could leave or whether the prosecutor's office planned to file charges against them. Goh said the pilots' group includes 120,000 pilots in over 100 countries and that such a large airspace boycott would be unprecedented. He said the association had discussed boycotts before but had never gone ahead. Goh said he met with the associations' London-based president, Capt. Ted Murphy, in Singapore on Wednesday and that they discussed a possible boycott. He did not give a time frame. He said a boycott ``is not a threat against the Taiwan people'' but a last resort. ``There are 30 airlines that fly into Taiwan and everybody has expressed concern,'' Goh said. ``If the situation were to deteriorate then of course the boycott has to take place.'' He said keeping the pilots in Taiwan was misguided and that investigators should not focus on assigning blame but rather on trying to figure out how the pilots were able to go down the wrong runway. ``All of us have been a victim of this crash. We should not make air safety a victim of this crash,'' Goh said. A preliminary report on the crash released last week confirmed the jetliner tried to take off on a runway that was closed for repair and plowed into construction equipment. The Taiwan Aviation Safety Council report blamed pilot error for the crash.

American businessman Edmund Pope today formally asked Russian President Vladimir Putin for a pardon. Pope was sentenced yesterday to 20 years hard labor after a Moscow court found him guilty of spying. Prosecutors said Pope had illegally obtained classified blueprints for a new Russian high-speed torpedo. Pope, whose company analyzes foreign maritime equipment, has maintained his innocence. He is the first American citizen to be jailed for espionage since the end of the cold war. The World's Nenad Chebeck is in Moscow. Nenad, yesterday Mr. Pope was sentenced despite an appeal for clemency by President Clinton. Why has he taken this legal option? Does he have no confidence in the courts? Well, I would say it is pretty clear that he has no confidence in the Russian judicial system. He did have an option of appealing to the Russian Supreme Court but frankly this is a more likely and a faster way to freedom, I would say. Because going through the appeals process is going to take months. He is known to be of ill health. He definitely wants to get out of the Lefortovo prison and it would appear by the latest signs that it is going to be the right way. Going through an Appeals Court would take a lot of time and the outcome would be highly uncertain. So Nenad, what's the timetable here? The request went to Putin. Putin in turn passes it on or has passed it on to the Presidential Pardons Commission. Is that correct? Yes, it has all happened actually very, very quickly. After the court cases dragged on for a couple of months and Pope has been in jail since April the 3rd, the ball really started rolling today. He wrote to Putin. Putin's office announced that the President has passed on the case to the Presidential Pardons Commission and today already we had the head of the commission appearing on Russian State television and saying that he will recommend a pardon to President Vladimir Putin. Now this commission is due to meet tomorrow but it is very difficult to envisage the commission not doing what the head of the commission has said it will do. The Presidential Pardons Commission in Russia, is that a relatively new institution? I would assume this being the first cold war spy case in 40 years in Russia that a certain number of institutions that are being involved, perhaps are being involved for the first time. Well, there are really no precedents here Tony because, as you mentioned, the last trial of an alleged foreign spy, was actually the trial of Gary Powers way back in 1961. And Gary Powers was shot down over Russia, so his guilt was fairly firmly established and ever since then any suspected spies were usually either sort of simply kicked out of the country, expelled, or they were arrested and then swapped for Russian spies arrested in western countries. The speed with which Mr. Putin seems to have responded to events here, is that any indication that perhaps he has found the whole incident embarrassing? It may be that this is simply a case which is not important on a wider scale for Putin, that he has shown what he needed to show to the Russian public, which is that the system is there, the system is going strong, it is taking care of the state secrets and, you know , the police is doing it's job, the Federal Security Service is doing its job. But now that that has been done with, now that we have had a conviction in court he does not see the necessity of pursuing the whole thing any further. And in order to appear magnanimous in the eyes of the western public opinion, certainly, I guess that those are the reasons which prompted him to move in the direction he has moved. And one would assume that the effort is also being made to make sure that US-Russian relations aren't seriously affected by this? Yes, because there have been a number of calls in the American Congress, for example, to introduce economic sanctions against Russia for this. The administration itself has not shown any willingness to get involved too deeply and certainly has not shown any willingness to introduce sanctions against Russia. But we do know that President Clinton has spoken to Vladimir Putin about this. We do know that the Secretary of State Madeleine Albright has raised the issue a number of times, so this will certainly help smooth the way towards the future of American administration, as and when there is one. The World's Nenad Chebeck in Moscow. Thanks again, Nenad. You are welcome, Tony.

The head of the Russia's Presidential Pardon Commission says he will recommend a pardon for Edmund Pope, the US businessman convicted of spying. The story from Sonia Paes in Moscow. In a letter to President Putin, Edmund Pope asked for clemency, saying he needs to return to the United States for medical treatment and to see his dying father. The head of the Presidential Pardon Commission said those humanitarian factors would be taken into consideration, and he said he hopes the commission will recommend a pardon. He also said he expects President Putin to act quickly on the commission's recommendation. Mr. Pope, who suffers from a rare form of bone cancer, was arrested last April and charged with illegally obtaining classified information on a Russian high-speed underwater torpedo. Mr. Pope maintained his innocence throughout the trial, saying the information he purchased was not secret and had already been sold overseas. On Wednesday, a Russian court found him guilty and sentenced him to 20-years hard labor. Sonia Paes, VOA News, Moscow.

At the United Nations, controversy has broken out over a proposal to drastically tighten sanctions against the Taliban government in Afghanistan. VOA correspondent Breck Ardery has more on this from the United Nations. A proposed UN Security Council resolution jointly sponsored by Russia and the United States would tighten economic sanctions against the Taliban and ban all weapon shipments to them. The proposal goes considerably beyond the existing sanctions, which ban Taliban air flights and freeze international bank accounts held by the Taliban. Sponsors say the resolution is specifically meant to pressure the Taliban, to abandon its support of terrorism, and to surrender indicted terrorist Osama Bin Laden. But Pakistan's ambassador to the United Nations Shamsed Ahmed told reporters his nation is strongly against the resolution and it is the wrong way to fight terrorism. We abhor terrorism in all its forms and manifestations. We are with the international community in combating this menace all over the world. As far as this particular individual is concerned, this is a problem that needs to be resolved between the United States and the government in Afghanistan, which now is Taliban. Mr. Ahmad says that instead of sanctions, the international community should engage in a dialogue with the Taliban. But Russia's ambassador Serge Lavroff says the Taliban leadership does not inspire trust. The problem is that the Taliban never delivered on a single promise, be this to resume, to start the dialogue, be this to stop fighting, be this to treat women and girls properly, or any other demand from the Security Council, in particular to stop the support for terrorism. An American official told reporters the proposed new sanctions are not meant to harm the Afghan people. He points out that humanitarian aid is specifically exempt from the sanctions. He says, the United States is currently the largest single donor of food and relief supplies to the Afghan people and that the aid will continue. Breck Ardery, VOA News, at the United Nations.

A new commander took charge of Israeli forces in the Gaza Strip on Friday, replacing a general who published a controversial inquiry into the shooting of a Palestinian boy whose death became a symbol for the current uprising. Maj. Gen. Doron Almog assumed command of Israel's southern front, which includes the Gaza Strip, the military said. He replaced Maj. Gen. Yom Tov Samia, who was set to retire in October but remained in uniform because of the Palestinian violence, which erupted Sept. 28. Samia ordered an inquiry into the Sept. 30 death of Mohammed Aldura, 12, who was caught in a crossfire at a Gaza intersection and died in his father's arms in view of a television camera. On Nov. 27, Samia called a news conference to release the results of the inquiry. He said it showed that the boy might have been killed by Palestinian, not Israeli, gunfire. The inquiry was plagued by premature discussion of its results, and its methods were questioned. Also, the scene of the shooting was destroyed when Israel cleared the area to stop Palestinian attacks there. It had to be reconstructed for the inquiry. In an interview on Israel television to mark his retirement, Samia lashed out at Israeli hard-liners who charge that the government is restricting army operations against Palestinians, using the slogan, ``Let the army win.'' Samia called the slogan ``nonsensical, contemptible and improper.'' He said he had taken ``all the steps and actions that must be taken'' to stop the violence. Almog has been serving alongside Samia for the past two months. His last position was director of the army's doctrine and training branch.

Russian lawmakers on Friday overwhelmingly approved the Soviet anthem as Russia's national hymn _ a move praised by some as a gesture of reconciliation and denounced by others as a symbolic approval of the nation's totalitarian past. The State Duma, or lower house of parliament, voted 381-51 to approve the bill, which was strongly backed by President Vladimir Putin. The move restored the old anthem's music by composer Alexander Alexandrov but not the original text that included praise for Communist leaders Vladimir Lenin and Josef Stalin. By the same strong majority, the Duma approved legislation formally endorsing the country's current white-red-and-blue flag as Russia's official flag. That legislation also brings back the Soviet-era red banner as the military's flag and retains the Czarist double-headed eagle as the state emblem. Putin has said the mixture of old Russian and Soviet symbols would mend bitter rifts in society by paying tribute to the positive heritage of both periods. He referred to opinion polls showing that most people prefer Alexandrov's music to a melody by 19th-century composer Mikhail Glinka, which has been Russia's anthem since the 1991 Soviet collapse. Liberal politicians and many leading cultural figures have strongly opposed the reinstatement of the Soviet anthem, saying it symbolized political repression. ``We strongly protest against the Stalinist anthem, which is stained by the blood of millions of victims,'' said Grigory Yavlinsky, the head of the liberal Yabloko faction. Yabloko and another liberal faction, the Union of Right Forces, said they might appeal Friday's vote in the Constitutional Court. The Duma usually hears speeches by faction leaders before a vote, but this time lawmakers skipped the debate _ a move the liberals described as a procedural violation. ``For the first time, the opposition was refused the right to speak out,'' Yavlinsky said. ``The presidential administration and Communists were afraid of our arguments against the Soviet anthem.'' Former President Boris Yeltsin has joined other critics of the move to restore the anthem. He said in an interview published Friday in the daily Komsomolskaya Pravda that the solemn music recalls Communist Party congresses, not Soviet sports victories and achievements in space, as Putin had said. ``I'm categorically against the restoration of the Soviet anthem,'' Yeltsin said. Communists and other hard-liners had opposed the tricolor flag and the eagle as a vestige of the Czars, forcing Yeltsin to approve them by decree. But they agreed to abandon their criticism and back formal approval for the symbols in response to the reintroduction of the Soviet anthem. No conclusive version of new lyrics for the old music has been approved yet. The Duma asked Putin to set up a panel to consider the text and submit the final version for its approval. During Friday's debate, Duma speaker Gennady Seleznyov said officials had received an anonymous telephone call saying a bomb had been planted in the building. Lawmakers ignored it and continued their session as police officers with sniffer dogs searched the premises.

President Clinton on Friday called Russian President Vladimir Putin to urge him once again to free American businessman Edmond Pope, who was convicted of espionage earlier this week. Clinton spoke on the phone with Putin for about 10 minutes just after he made a foreign policy speech at the University of Nebraska in Kearney, Neb. The president encouraged Pope's release on humanitarian grounds because Pope is sick, White House press secretary Jake Siewert told reporters in Nebraska. ``I'm not going to characterize Putin's response, but we're going to keep working on it,'' Siewert said. Earlier in the day, the White House welcomed a Russian commission's recommendation that Putin pardon Pope. ``It remains our position that Edmond Pope should be released, and we hope that President Putin will act on the recommendation of the commission,'' said P.J. Crowley, White House national security spokesman. A Moscow court on Wednesday convicted Pope, of State College, Pa., of espionage and sentenced the 54-year-old to 20 years in a maximum-security prison. Russian authorities said Pope, a former Navy officer, had illegally obtained classified plans for a high-speed underwater torpedo. Friday, Russia's presidential pardons commission recommended Pope be freed, citing his failing health. Pope's wife has said he is suffering from recurrent bone cancer and his health has deteriorated since being jailed April 3. ``Pope is a sick man, who has gone through a lot, and he should be let go,'' commission head Anatoly Pristavkin said, according to the Interfax news agency. Thursday, national security adviser Sandy Berger said the administration hoped Putin would overturn an ``unjustifiable and wrong'' conviction. ``Ultimately, the decision will be made by President Putin, and we certainly hope he would exercise that authority,'' said Sandy Berger said. ``We have said to the Russians at every level, from the president on down, consistently, that we believe he should be released on humanitarian grounds, if nothing else,'' Berger said.

A lower house of the Russian Parliament the Duma has voted overwhelmingly to replace the current national anthem with a more familiar tune. The old Soviet anthem is to make a comeback but without the old words. It will replace the current anthem which was introduced by Boris Yeltsin after the breakup of the Soviet Union. The old anthem was composed in 1943 and personally approved by Joseph Stalin. Its return has provoked anger among opponents of President Putin. BBC News for The World.

The United States is hoping that Russia's President Vladimir Putin will follow the advice of his special commission and pardon Edmund Pope. This week the American businessman began serving a 20-year prison sentence in Moscow after being convicted of spying. Specifically Russian prosecutors charged that Pope had stolen secrets relating to a high-speed Russian torpedo. Pope denied the charges and Washington backed him up. Marsha Lippin is Editor of Moscow based newsmagazine 'Itogi'. Marsha, did the Presidential Pardons Commission give any reason for their decision? It gave several reasons. I am not sure if those were the formal reasons but members of the commission have been interviewed today by various outlets and they say that they were afraid of the spy mania rising in Russia, that they thought it was really suspicious to them that Edmund Pope was sentenced to the maximum term, whereas the article of the law had 10 to 20 years. He was sentenced to 20, even though according to the members of the Pardon Commission, the evidence that was presented by the prosecution was far from quotient. They also said this court did not give the lawyers for the defense due procedure. The court listened to the defense much less than it did to the prosecution. Much of this sounds less like a pardon and more like a criticism of the number of institutions that Mr. Putin also has to show some support of, including his court system and his police and his prosecutors. How is he going to respond to this and when? I don't think anybody knows and I don't think anybody will know until President Putin has responded. It is his decision. According to the Russian law the Pardon Commission, after it has made its decision, sends it to the President and it's up to him whether to endorse it or not to say no. One last question for you, Marsha. He does have a lot to balance doesn't he, President Putin? Not only the institutions I mentioned but the need to keep things somehow free of tension. Is this case likely to strain US-Russian relations? I'm afraid it might. Recently the Russian policy toward the US has fallen into a line where Russia tries to demonstrate force it once had but no longer does. It wants to put an end to what is regarded by the current Russian government as humiliation of the past years. There were numerous attempts to be a source of minor troubles even though Russia can no longer be a source of scare to the west and among such instances there were several, there was just recently flying over by Russian military planes over Kitty Hawk, an American warship. There is also a scandal that erupted over Russia's declaration that it will sell weapons to Iran, contrary to the earlier made agreement. Such examples are quite a few already, some of them are combined with material profits for Russia but not necessarily. Marsha Lippin is Editor of the Moscow based newsmagazine 'Itogi'. Marsha, thank you very much for speaking with us. Pleasure.

The crew of the USS Cole did not implement all of the self-protection measures the ship's skipper had drawn up before it was hit by a terrorist bomb in Aden harbor in Yemen, a senior defense official said. It could not be learned, however, whether Navy investigators had determined that the attack, which killed 17 sailors, might have been averted if the Cole's security plan had been implemented in full. The defense official, who discussed the matter Friday on condition of anonymity, said it was too early to know whether the Navy would hold anyone from the Cole accountable. The crew's failure to fully implement its written security plan was first reported Friday by CNN, which quoted an unnamed Pentagon official as saying regarding the crew's implementation of a security plan, ``They didn't do everything they said they were going to do.'' The New York Times posted a similar report on its Web site Friday. Two men in a small boat loaded with explosives maneuvered next to the 505-foot destroyer as the ship refueled in Aden harbor Oct. 12. The explosives detonated and ripped an enormous hole in the Cole's hull. In the weeks since, investigators have focused on whether the Cole had taken prudent security precautions and whether security activities spelled out in its operating plans were followed in all respects. Details of the Cole's self-protection plan, which were approved by higher-level commanders, have never been revealed. If Navy investigators determine that important security measures were not taken, Cmdr. Kirk Lippold, the Cole's captain, could be held accountable and his career damaged, officials said. Navy officials stressed that the investigation is not complete and that preliminary conclusions are subject to change. ``The public and the press need to avoid a rush to judgment'' about the outcome of the probe, said Rear Adm. Stephen Pietropaoli, the Navy's chief of information. ``The investigation continues.'' The Navy investigative report was transmitted this week from 5th Fleet headquarters in Bahrain to Adm. Robert Natter, commander in chief of the U.S. Atlantic Command in Norfolk, Va. From there it will go for a final judgment to Adm. Vern Clark, chief of naval operations at Navy headquarters in the Pentagon. Clark said this week that he would not comment on the investigation. Lippold, who previously served as an aide to Navy Secretary Richard Danzig, is highly regarded in the Navy. He has been credited, along with his crew, with saving the Cole from sinking in the days after the blast, which knocked out the ship's power and threatened to tear it nearly in half. Separately, the FBI is investigating who was behind the attack. It has not reported any conclusion, although Yemen's prime minister, Abdul-Karim al-Iryani, said Wednesday that at least three Yemenis suspected of belonging to an international terrorist network will go on trial next month in connection with the attack. The crippled Cole is now crossing the Atlantic Ocean aboard the heavy-lift ship Blue Marlin and is due to arrive at Litton Ingalls Shipbuilding in Pascagoula, Miss., on Wednesday, where it will undergo repairs estimated at $200 million. ___ On the Net: Navy's latest on the Cole: http://www.chinfo.navy.mil/navpalib/news/news-stories/cole.html

President Vladimir Putin of Russia said Saturday that he would accept the recommendation of his presidential pardon commission to set free Edmond Pope, the former naval intelligence officer sentenced last week to 20 years for alleged espionage. His release is expected as early as Thursday. In Putin's first public comments since a Moscow judge imposed the maximum sentence on Pope, an American, on Wednesday, the Russian leader said the recommendation for clemency was made by ``respected people'' and ``I cannot but heed their opinion.'' A 16-member clemency board made up of academics, writers and other well-known intellectuals voted unanimously on Friday to urge Putin to free Pope on humanitarian grounds. After his conviction following a seven-week closed trial here, Pope opted to seek a pardon instead of pressing an appeal of his conviction. ``My father is terminally ill and I wish to visit him one last time,'' Pope wrote to the presidential commission. Anatoly I. Pristavkin, a Soviet-era writer who is chairman of the commission, said on Russian television Friday night that the commission's recommendation showed ``that we are a magnanimous people, although legends circulate in the world about our cruelty.'' Other members of the commission suggested that ``spy mania'' had gone too far in the Pope case. Mark G. Rosovsky, a playwright and a theater director, said the case arose ``in an absolutely different historical context'' from the famous spy cases of the Cold War, ``and we today have to understand that the very concepts of espionage and spy mania have changed under contemporary conditions.'' A commission member, Marietta O. Chudakova, took the criticism one step further, saying, ``The investigative organs in our country still bear the marks of the Soviet system, more so than society in general.'' She said she hoped Putin would take that point. A Russian lawyer who was a member of Pope's legal team was briefly detained on Friday near the courthouse in Moscow where the trial occurred, driven across the city, and released near Leningradsky railway station, said Pavel Astakhov, Pope's lead lawyer. Astakhov said Pope's legal team was the object of surveillance and harassment during the case. The unexplained detention led to an immediate protest by the Moscow lawyers association. Putin's made his remarks Saturday while visiting Magnitogorsk, a huge metallurgical center in the Ural Mountains. He did not comment on the substance of the espionage charge against Pope, which involved his alleged receipt of secret information about the high-speed Shkval, or Squall, torpedo system. The system represented a breakthrough in underwater propulsion technology in the late 1970s. At the trial, Pope's lawyers argued that the information he received was available from open sources. Prosecutors, however, offered evidence that some of the information was classified, and raised the question of what kind of publicly available information required the transfer by Pope of $28,000 to the Russian scientist with whom he was dealing. Also arrested last April was Anatoly Babkin, the head of the rocket engine department at Bauman State Technical University. Babkin has since suffered two heart attacks and has yet to face criminal proceedings. Pope's lawyers have asserted that Babkin recanted his initial testimony that information provided to the American included secret material. However, other scientific witnesses also testified at the trial that some of the Shkval's secrets were compromised in the material prepared for sale to Pope and his associates at Pennsylvania State University. Putin said he had spoken with President Clinton about the case on Friday and had assured him that Pope would be offered any needed medical care from Russian doctors until the final decision was made on the pardon. Pope has suffered from a rare form of bone cancer. Putin also said an important reason for his consideration of a pardon was not to allow the Pope case to lead to a worsening of Russian-American relations. After Pope's arrest, a number of members of Congress denounced his detention and warned Moscow that if he was not released on humanitarian grounds the case would poison relations with the next U.S. president and undermine the important agenda of arms control and international security questions pending between Washington and Moscow. By pardoning Pope, Putin will back his domestic counterintelligence service, which initiated the case against Pope and Babkin, while also advertising to the world that Russia remains a technological power that, though degraded, harbors a great deal of artful science _ especially in physics, optics, space and lasers _ that has marketable value. The delay in acting on the request for a pardon is a matter of Russian law, officials said, explaining that the verdict against Pope does not come into force until one week after it is handed down. At that time, Putin could grant the pardon, which means he will probably act on Thursday, when he is scheduled to be in Cuba. Pope's wife, Cheri, who kept a vigil in Moscow during the final arguments at the trial, expressed hope that she and her husband would be able to return to the United States in time for Christmas.

Former president Ion Iliescu was returned to office Sunday by a landslide in a runoff election, exit polls showed. Iliescu, a former communist, was defeating ultranationalist Corneliu Vadim Tudor by about 70 percent to 30 percent, the polls showed. But Tudor, who won notoriety over the years for denouncing Jews and Gypsies, branded the exit poll figures as ``the biggest fraud in Romania's history of the 20th century'' and claimed Iliescu ``cannot justify where he got all the votes.'' Tudor, appearing on Antenna-1 television, accused Iliescu's party of bribing election officials and those conducting exit polls. The polls, conducted by the IMAS polling institute, were based on interviews with about 20,000 people questioned as they finished voting. Another poll by INSOMAR had similar results. Official results are not expected until Monday. The runoff was called after Iliescu failed to secure the 50 percent needed for outright victory in the first round on Nov. 26. He won 36 percent in November to Tudor's 28 percent. Iliescu, a Soviet-educated engineer who was president from 1990 to 1996, was favored to win. He has promised a measured reform of the economy to ensure a ``dignified'' entry into European institutions. To secure victory, he needed the support of centrist parties. These mainstream groups pledged to back the former communist functionary, fearing that Romania could become an international pariah if Tudor won. Although Tudor is known for his anti-Semitic and racist remarks, he has recently sought to tone down his statements. He is also known for his poetry praising the late dictator Nicolae Ceausescu during his lifetime. Tudor attracts voters who are disenchanted with politicians, while Iliescu is supported by poor Romanians, rural voters and those who lived well under communism. ``I voted for Corneliu Vadim Tudor to get rid of the crooks,'' said Iosif Briscov, a 70-year-old pensioner in the Tranylvanian city of Cluj. ``We don't need NATO and the European Union. We need to be shut off until we wake up.'' Iliescu, 70, had been close to Ceausescu until the early 1970s, but later led the revolt to topple the dictator. ``I am confident that the future of Romania will be decided in the way it should be,'' Iliescu said as he cast his ballot. ``I urge people to vote for a better future.'' ``Today we will decide whether to continue the process of consolidating a law-abiding country and of rebuilding Romania or whether to block this process,'' he added. Meanwhile, an angry voter threw a bottle of blue ink in outgoing President Emil Constantinescu's face as he voted in the same polling station as Iliescu. He got the ink into his eyes but he was not injured. Constantinescu was whisked away in his car and the man was immobilized by Constantinescu's security officers. The assailant is a member of the Greater Romania party from the southwestern city of Timisoara. Lab tests showed the substance was not toxic. Although Iliescu espouses democracy, he has indicated he will not promote the rapid and painful economic reforms that Romania needs to improve its laggard economy and join the European Union. Claiming that he had been ``hunted like an animal'' by the Romanian media since the first round of voting, Tudor on Sunday accused Iliescu of planning to rig the elections. ``We will integrate into Europe but in our own specific way,'' he told a crowd of journalists and supporters. ``We won't be the day laborers and garbage collectors of Europe.'' ``Time is on my side,'' he claimed. ``From now on, in every Romanian child a little Vadim will be born.'' Tudor, 51, was a fringe politician until the late 1990s. Before last month's race, he surged in popularity after promising to root out corruption and promote the rule of law. His sudden rise has stunned Romanians and alarmed the county's elite, many of whom are lambasted as ``traitors'' in Tudor's weekly Greater Romania magazine.

Secretary of State Madeleine Albright hugged one of Botswana's most celebrated singers Monday after the woman revealed for the first time that she was infected with the AIDS virus that is so ominously threatening the country. Mayoress Molefi-Mochangana told Albright and a small group of women meeting inside a prenatal clinic in the poor neighborhood of Old Naledi that a recent HIV test showed she was infected. She urged other women to find out whether they have the deadly virus. ``I'm living a happier life, and working and still a musician,'' the traditional singer said. In a later speech, Albright praised Molefi-Mochangana's bravery in confronting the stigma against the disease. ``She is a wonderful example of what we can accomplish when we confront life's most daunting challenges with courage,'' she said. There are few challenges more daunting than AIDS in Botswana, estimated to be the worst-infected country in the world. According to government figures, 29 percent of adults here have HIV. The United Nations estimates that more than one-third of adults are infected. Of the 62,000 babies born every year, 8,700 are infected with the disease, Health Minister Joy Phumaphi said. The government provides a rigorous course of AZT for HIV-infected pregnant women to prevent them from transmitting the virus to their babies during childbirth. It also gives them baby formula to protect the child from the mother's infected breast milk. But in the country's small villages, women seen with formula are immediately suspected of being infected and summarily ostracized. Many pregnant women are simply too frightened to take advantage of the government programs. ``The rate of mother-to-child transmission in Botswana continues to grow, particularly in rural areas, where women are not able to benefit as much from public education,'' Phumaphi said at a ceremony outside the maternity clinic, one of the busiest in the country. Albright announced a U.S. government donation of 200 trailers to be used as HIV counseling centers across this vast, sparsely populated country. Inside the clinic, Albright sat with a group of women beneath posters urging testing. ``Make a new start today. Know your status,'' one poster read. A counselor tried to coax a group of pregnant women to take an HIV test. But many of the women said they feared having to tell their families they were infected. Later, Albright met privately with President Festus Mogae and discussed the United States' efforts to stop the trade in conflict diamonds. Mogae expressed concern those efforts might hurt Botswana, which accounts for about one-third of the $6 billion annual trade in diamonds and has one of the strongest economic growth rates in Africa, according to a senior state department official. Albright reassured him that would not happen, the official said. Albright's visit to Africa is part of what could be her last big trip as secretary of state. By visiting South Africa, Mauritius and Botswana, she has worked to highlight three African democracies with strong economies. Albright is scheduled to fly Tuesday to Algeria to witness the signing of a peace agreement between Ethiopia and Eritrea. She then plans to travel to Europe.

In this African nation where about a third of all adults are infected with HIV _ the highest rate in the world _ Secretary of State Madeleine Albright hugged a singing star and praised her bravery Monday after the entertainer revealed she was infected with the AIDS virus. The gesture was a potent one in a nation where AIDS infection brings shame and social ostracism, and acknowledging infection is taboo. Mayoress Molefi-Mochangana, one of Botswana's most celebrated singers, told Albright and a small group of women meeting inside a prenatal clinic that she learned of her infection from a recent HIV test and she urged other women to find out whether they have the deadly virus. ``I'm living a happier life, and working and still a musician,'' said Molefi-Mochangana, a traditional singer who records with her brother as Stiger &AMP; Sister. In a later speech, Albright praised Molefi-Mochangana's bravery in confronting the stigma against the disease. ``She is a wonderful example of what we can accomplish when we confront life's most daunting challenges with courage,'' Albright said. There are few challenges more daunting than AIDS in Botswana, where the United Nations estimates that more than one-third of adults are infected. Of the 62,000 babies born every year, 8,700 are infected with the disease, according to Health Minister Joy Phumaphi. The government provides a rigorous course of AZT for HIV-infected pregnant women to prevent them from transmitting the virus to their babies during childbirth and gives them baby formula to protect the child from the mother's infected breast milk. But in the country's small villages, women seen with formula are immediately suspected of being infected and ostracized. The stigma against HIV is so overwhelming that many pregnant women are simply too frightened to take advantage of government programs. ``The rate of mother-to-child transmission in Botswana continues to grow, particularly in rural areas, where women are not able to benefit as much from public education,'' Phumaphi told guests at a ceremony outside the maternity clinic, one of the busiest in the country. On Monday, Albright announced a U.S. government donation of 200 trailers to be used as HIV counseling centers across the vast, sparsely populated country. The donation includes 200 televisions and video recorders to play a new video to teach pregnant woman how to prevent transmitting the virus to their children. Molefi-Mochangana's band recorded the video soundtrack. ``As a mother and a grandmother, I must say I feel a special love and a friendship with all of you, because I can understand how difficult this all is,'' Albright said in a speech outside the clinic. ``There is nothing more personal than having a child and nothing that provides you more pleasure and love, and yet you have to go through what is clearly a very difficult and important moment in deciding to be tested in order to save the life of that child and learn something about yourself. So my heart goes out to you.'' Inside the clinic, Albright sat with a group of women beneath posters urging testing. ``Make a new start today. Know your status,'' one poster read. A counselor named Beatrice tried to coax a group of pregnant women to take an HIV test. ``If you don't take it, know that you and your child are not safe at all,'' she said. But many of the women said they feared having to tell their families they were infected. Albright's visit to Africa is part of what could be her last big trip as secretary of state. In her visits to South Africa, Mauritius in Botswana, she has worked to highlight three African democracies with strong economies. But she has also cast attention to the devastating AIDS pandemic raging across the continent. Albright is scheduled to fly Tuesday to Algeria to witness the signing of a peace agreement between Ethiopia and Eritrea. She then plans to travel to Europe. After visiting the prenatal center, Albright presented $1.6 million to the University of Botswana to support projects in environmental science, women in science, research and development and technology training. ``This is my natural setting as a former professor and probably a future one,'' Albright joked as she announced the U.S. government donation.

This is The World. I am Lisa Mullins. Foreign aid workers in Afghanistan are warning that US calls for an arms embargo against the country could put them at risk and prolong the civil war there. The American proposal would ban weapon shipments to Afghanistan's ruling Taliban movement. The Taliban has implemented a literal interpretation of Islam that restricts the activities of women. At least one American woman Mary McNecan has felt the Taliban's wrath. McNecan has worked in Afghanistan since 1961 and has been helping Afghan widows find work through her non-governmental organization "Persa." But 5 months ago McNecan was given the boot. I was just about going out and at the top of the stairs I saw these men silently running up the steps and I told them, "You can't come in here, this is a woman's office". They didn't pay any attention, they just brushed by, so I knew it was a raid from the Ministry of Vice and Virtue. So then they started collecting papers, and folders, and books, and everything they could find and putting them in their large shawls and then picking up the four corners and putting this bundle over their shoulders and walking out. So you and some of the women, several of the women in fact, who were working in the office with you, were all arrested and put in jail? That is correct. Yeah, it was just after lunch, so actually the other women, 7 of them, were still just finishing their tea, so they told us we had to come too. Now the Taliban charged you with spying and with trying to convert Muslims to Christianity. What became of those charges? Well, you know more than I do. They never told me anything except just the spying. I don't know what I'd be spying for or about and since I am not , certainly not an active Christian I wouldn't be doing any proselytizing, so there must be other reasons. For instance, my having women in the office just after they had issued another order that all Afghan women had to go home, and possibly, in my newsletters, which come out about 3 to 4 times a year, I might have said something injudicious about the Taliban. In the beginning the Taliban said that eventually, once the rules were known they could ease up and loosen up a bit. Have you seen any kind of a shift for the better in the past 4 years since the Taliban has been in authority in Kabul? Only in very small matters. One, for instance, when they first came, all kinds of sports were forbidden. But now in the last 2 years there has been a bit of lightening up in that and Afghanistan has been fielding a soccer team, and volleyball teams, and actually playing and hosting games with Pakistani boys' teams. Also in the very, very beginning it was forbidden for women to wear white Tambans, such as the baggy pants, which are strictly for older women, they have always worn white baggy pants under their dresses. But because the flag, the Taliban flag is white, this was forbidden and that seems to have been forgotten about because nobody says anything about that nowadays. You know some of the criticism that you have lodged at the Taliban is not that unlike some of the criticism that comes from some feminist groups here in the United States. Although, I know that they have been focussing on what you consider some of the wrong aspects regarding Taliban rule, can you explain that difference? I don't feel they are focusing wrongly, I think some of the arguments they used were inaccurate or based on false premises. The main thing that seems to stick in women's, in American women's minds about the situation there is, they tell will me, "Oh it is so bad because Afghan women don't have health care". Well this is a misconception, because although the first 6 months it is true, this is another thing the Taliban closed down. They closed down all the medical facilities for the women back in September '96 when they came and this was appalling. I mean this was definitely a dreadful thing and the NGOs, of course, protested. In fact one hospital that had been for women was reactivated and so by the end of '97 there was a hospital just for women and it continued to get better and better for women through 1998 and 1999. There are many, many facilities for women, clinics also that are run by the NGOs. So, at present there are only 2 hospitals that are only for men, those are military hospitals. So is the point that we have it wrong? That we are misreading what is happening there? That even though there are such dire conditions for women as you have described, that there are some things that are getting better? All right, yeah, I will agree that the health conditions, conditions for women, that has improved over these 4 years. But that is about all. With the basic decrees against women working and girls getting educated are still in place. And I don't see any signs of that being let up at all. For those who are wondering what the United States government, what the United Nations in particular, can do at this point to try and pressure the Taliban to change conditions, what do you say? People are really straining at this because it is so hard. There are human rights groups that, if possible, get women organized into little groups and teach them what their rights are. But this is impossible because if any women get together, of course the religious police will hear about it and the women will be beaten and may be even jailed. And there are many active Afghan women who are working towards women's rights. The other, I suppose, is keeping a barrage of letters to the State Department to increase pressure on the Taliban, because they are sensitive to external pressure finally. For a while for the first year or two they just felt they were free agents, that they had, were beholden to nobody. The other thing is possible is to please donate to your favorite NGO or charity group which are concerned with Afghan women because through the NGOs in Kabul and other places in Afghanistan, income generating projects are reaching them. For instance we are training widows' sons in things like electrical work and plumbing. So the widow gets help through her trained son who can then set up a business. You are in the United States right now. Do you expect to be able to return to Afghanistan and do you expect your work to continue whether or not you are there? Well I have a men's office in Kabul and as far as I know they are carrying on projects there. And I have an office now in Peshawar, Pakistan and I don't think I will try to go to Kabul for a while. But if I can find a way to get back, of course, I will go back. Mary McNecan runs "Parsa", a non-governmental organization based in Kabul. She now lives in Peshawar, Pakistan.

Who was the best soccer player of the 20th century? Well, that has turned out to be a tougher than expected question for the sport's international governing body known as FIFA. Many soccer fanatics think that the great Brazilian goal-maker of the 50s, 60s and 70s, Pele deserves the honor. So revered is the man from Rio de Janeiro's poverty stricken hinterlands that a journalist once quipped ,"If Pele had not been born a man he would have been born a soccer ball." But many Argentines have their favorite son, the diminutive flashy attacker Diego Maradona who played in the 80s and 90s. Well to settle the dispute FIFA today decided to award both men Player of the Century awards. The so called grand jury chose Pele and the FIFA sponsored internet survey saw Diego Maradona the victor. And on the women's side the recently retired US star Michelle Akers won FIFA's grand jury prize for soccer player of the century while China's Sun Wen won the internet vote.

North and South Korea begin a new round of ministerial talks today aimed at speeding up their reconciliation process. The talks in the northern capital Pyongyang, are expected to last four days. Delegations from the two sides will assess developments since the historic North-South Summit of last June. Media reports say the talks maybe difficult because North Korea recently criticized South Korea for labeling Pyongyang its main enemy. Pyongyang is demanding that Seoul abandon such views. South Korean Unification Minister, Park Jai Ku, who heads his country's 38-member delegation to the talks, says either side can raise any issue it wants.

Romania's former President Ian Illyescu appears to have won a landslide victory in the country's run-off presidential elections. With just over 98% of the votes tallied, Romania's Central Election Commission says the former Communist has nearly 67% of the vote, compared to just over 33% for his opponent Conyor Vadim Tudor. The former President declared victory early Monday, saying his win represents a defeat for extremism and totalitarianism. He pledged to work hard to bring Romania into the European Union and into NATO. Mr. Tudor, who had been called a dangerous xenophobic extremist, appeared on National television to denounce the election as the biggest fraud in Romania this century. His campaign featured strong criticism of gypsies and Jews. Mr. Illyescu's Romanian Social Democratic party won 45% of the seats in parliament in the first round of elections two weeks ago.

The Voice of America presents differing points of view on a wide variety of issues. Next, an editorial reflecting American ideals and institutions. The United Nations Security Council is considering a resolution to increase sanctions on the Taliban Movement, which occupies most of Afghanistan. The United States and Russia introduced the resolution because of the Taliban's support for terrorism. This includes a failure to comply with UN demands to hand over terrorist leader Osama Bin Laden to a place where he can be brought to justice. Osama Bin Laden heads the terrorist group Al-Qaida. Along with others he has been indicted by a US court in connection with the bombings of American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in August of 1998. The attacks killed hundreds of people and wounded thousands. Nevertheless, the Taliban have provided safe haven to Bin Laden and Al-Qaida in Afghanistan. In response, the UN Security Council adopted resolution 1267 in October 1999. The resolution imposed a ban on most flights of Arianna Afghan airlines and froze Taliban financial assets in other countries. The proposed UN resolution would impose an arms embargo on the Taliban, reduce their diplomatic representation and ban all flights to Afghanistan, except those for humanitarian purposes. It would also restrict travel of top Taliban officials, except for peace negotiations, humanitarian reasons or fulfillment of religious obligations. In addition, the UN resolution would ban sales to Afghanistan of Acidic Anhydride, a chemical used to make the illicit drug heroin. Under the Taliban, for the last three years, Afghanistan has been the world's top producer of opium, which is used to make heroin. In spite of massive food shortages caused by the worst drought in a generation, the Taliban have allowed opium poppy cultivation to expand, displacing more than 64 thousand hectares of food crops in prime agricultural land. As with the current sanctions, the proposed sanctions are aimed at the Taliban, not the Afghan people. The US has long provided the most aid to Afghans, including more than 113 million dollars worth of food and other help this year. After decades of war and repression, it is time for a government in Afghanistan that rejects terrorism and drug trafficking, respects human rights and seeks a peaceful end to the country's conflict.

Belgrade's prosecutor filed abuse of power charges Tuesday against former members of the Federal Electoral Commission, which had declared that Vojislav Kostunica fell short of the required majority to be elected president. Borivoje Vukicevic, who was head of the commission, and three of his aides were charged with ``crimes related with abuse of power'' in connection with the Sept. 24 election, the official Tanjug news agency said. An investigating judge will determine whether the four will be arrested pending trial. A trial date was not set. The commission acknowledged that Kostunica outpolled President Slobodan Milosevic but said he fell short of the required majority. Before a runoff could be held, Kostunica's followers rioted in Belgrade, forcing the former president to step down. The Belgrade prosecutor's office did not file charges against Milosevic, saying investigators failed to find sufficient evidence that the former president encouraged the election commission to commit fraud.

Britain and North Korea agreed Tuesday to establish diplomatic relations _ recognition, Britain said, of Pyongyang's warming relationship with South Korea and its decision to suspend missile launches. The decision marks the first time Britain has had diplomatic ties with the communist Democratic People's Republic of Korea since its creation 50 years ago. In a sign of its improving relations with the outside world, North Korea has this year already established diplomatic links with Canada, Italy and Austria. Britain said in October that it was ready to follow suit, and Tuesday's announcement came after five days of talks in London between government officials. British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said the decision ``was taken in recognition of the significant progress'' in the dialogue between the two Koreas, particularly a landmark June summit between their leaders, Kim Jong Il and Kim Dae-jung. South Korea's Foreign Ministry welcomed Tuesday's decision, saying it ``will not only improve relations between the two countries, but also play a positive role in building peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula through inter-Korean reconciliation and cooperation.'' Cook also praised ongoing communication between the United States and North Korea, as well as the communist country's moratorium on missile launches. ``We believe that dialogue and negotiation are the best ways of securing peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula,'' Cook said. In a joint statement, the two governments said they would appoint ambassadors after arranging for permanent mission offices in London and Pyongyang.

Two of Africa's most bitter rivals Ethiopia and Eritrea signed have signed a peace agreement today and while everyone said the right things about mutual respect and forgetting the past, there are also grounds for cynicism. The two nations have reached accords before and Ethiopia has said it will not establish normal relations with Eritrea until there is a change in government in Ismara but today was a day for optimism on the horn of Africa. To find out why the mood is brighter we turn to the BBC's Neeta Bali in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Neeta, do people there expect this peace deal to stick? It certainly isn't the first time we've have had agreements between these two sides but none of them have lasted. Is anything different this time around? Well, there hasn't actually been any agreement signed as such before. There have been negotiations on various peace deals and one of the biggest problems has been about the border issue, but both sides now seem to be happy with how this disputed border will be demarcated and delimited, and so, I think, once that seems to have some kind of holding on the ground, people are looking at moving on. The war has been waging for over two years now since May 1998. Everyone seems to be fed up of it. Both countries talk about development, about rebuilding their economies and I think they have suffered far too much now and have realized that it's time now to get things moving again in their own respective countries instead of fighting with one another. You mentioned this disputed border. A little history here might help to put this in perspective. Ethiopia and Eritrea used to be part of the same country. They have endured tyrannical leaders together and after Eritrea broke away and gained its independence back in 1993, they began fighting over this barren patch of land along their border. Why? Well, that's one of the things that has been misunderstood. It's not just a barren piece of land especially to Ethiopians, and Ethiopia is one of the few countries in Africa not to have been colonized. So people here have a real sense of independence, a real sense of pride about their country and so it isn't just a dispute about, you know, a couple of kilometers of land, it's about the country's sovereignty, about the country's pride, and, I think, that's why it's hit people here very strongly. The government by and large has had the full support of the people here and although there has been a famine where over 10 million people have needed food assistance, this hasn't stopped any kind of support by the local people here in Ethiopia. Eritrea was a former province, as we said, of Ethiopia, but when it gained its independence it cut the rest of Ethiopia off from the sea. I wonder if in this agreement that has been signed, if access to the sea was dealt with? Access to the sea hasn't been dealt with as such but there are four main issues here. There is one about the border, which needs to be demarcated. There is another about an investigation into the instigation of how the war actually started. There is a humanitarian issue here about each country claiming detention of its civilians in the other country, and then there is also the fourth issue, which is of claims commission, and they will be looking at that about possibly gaining access to one of the ports in Eritrea called Astad port in the east. Can you talk about the United States role in forging this agreement? Yes. Anthony Lake, the US presidential envoy has played an integral part. The Ethiopians certainly have been telling me that although on the surface of it, it seems to be an OAU-brokered peace deal, Anthony Lake has been shuttling over the past two and a half years between Addis Ababa and Ismara and did play a very key role and actually did persuade the Eritreans to accept all the elements of the peace deal. I wonder, given that, if there is a reason why the United States won't be contributing in terms of peacekeepers, in terms of actual bodies to the peacekeeping effort? I think, they may within the next year or so. It's very difficult to tell at the moment, a lot of countries have been very wary, and have decided to donate and to stretch their support in terms of finances rather than in troops. And they want to see just how the first three months or the first six months go and then perhaps we will see troops actually coming in. The BBC's Neeta Bali speaking to us from Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Thank you very much for the update Neeta. You are welcome.

The Clinton administration is expressing confidence the UN Security Council will vote next week to tighten sanctions against Afghanistan's dominant Taliban movement because of its support for international terrorism. It says the sanction's package will not prevent delivery of humanitarian aid to the country. VOA's David Gallust reports from the White House. With a serious drought compounding the damage caused by a generation of civil war in Afghanistan, the sanctions move has drawn criticism from some UN members who say it will worsen the already dire situation for ordinary Afghans. However, Clinton administration officials insist the package is targeted only at the Taliban leadership to increase the pressure on them to curb terrorism and in particular hand over Osama Bin Laden. He is the Saudi exile living under Taliban protection, who is blamed for a series of terror attacks including the 1998 bombings of two US embassies in Africa. The sanctions package would among other things impose a comprehensive ban on arms sales to the Taliban, demand the closing of its diplomatic offices around the world, forbid most flights to the landlocked country and bar the sales of chemicals needed to transform Afghan opium into heroin. It renews the demand to surrender Mr. Bin Laden and to close terrorist training bases within 30 days. In a statement, Assistant US Secretary of State for South Asian Affairs Carl Enderforth said the Taliban's refusal to comply with a UN anti-terrorism resolution last year forced the move to tighter sanctions. But he said the new measure is designed to avoid additional harm to the Afghan people, most of whom he acknowledged, are living in desperate conditions. Mr. Enderforth said trade and humanitarian shipments of food and medicine would not be affected and the new sanctions regime would allow flights of relief goods and for religious pilgrimages. At a briefing here, White House National Security Council Counter-Terrorism coordinator Richard Clark said he expects the resolution, under debate since late last month, to get final approval next week. That resolution will be co-sponsored by Russia and the United States. We expect it to gain widespread support in the Security Council. There is I think almost universal recognition around the world that the Taliban regime that pretends to be the government of Afghanistan is a criminal organization. Mr. Clark's comments came as the administration issued a report on international crime, which said Afghan opium production has skyrocketed in recent years, despite Taliban's professed opposition to the drug trade on religious grounds. It said virtually all of Afghanistan's opium growing and heroin processing shelters are in territory under Taliban control and the drug traffickers, who pay taxes to Taliban authorities, operate there with impunity. There have been concerns expressed at the UN that new sanctions might scuttle efforts to start peace talks between Taliban and rival militia groups and perhaps prompt retaliation against aid personnel in the country. At the State Department Mr. Enderforth urged Taliban to take no action that would impede relief operations and to provide the necessary security for humanitarian aid workers.

In Dammaj, it can be dangerous to mention America. In this dusty village in northern Yemen, on the edge of the great Arabian desert called the Empty Quarter, it is enough to mention the United States among the thousands of Islamic militants who teach and study here, to furrow brows, darken voices and set trigger fingers tightening. Long after the fashion began to fade among the ayatollahs of Iran, the militants of Dammaj still call America ``the Great Satan.'' Though a few American Muslims have come here as talibs, or seekers after Islamic truths, the best advice to other Americans would surely be: stay clear. In the village's heart, at a sprawling compound guarded by bushy-bearded men flourishing Kalashnikov rifles, one of the Arab world's most militantly anti-Western Islamic clerics has his base. His name is Sheik Muqbel bin Hadi al-Wadie. He is 70, and a font of vituperation against the United States and Israel, Christians and Jews. Years after he became a force here, few outside the closed world of Islamic militancy, other than Western scholars and counterterrorism experts, have heard of him. But Muqbel is no stranger to the FBI, who know him as a seminal influence on Osama bin Laden, the FBI's most wanted terrorist. Long before the Oct. 12 bombing of the destroyer Cole in Aden harbor, 400 miles away at Yemen's southern tip _ an attack investigators have linked in numerous but so far inconclusive ways to bin Laden's terrorist network _ the FBI saw Muqbel's study centers, particularly the one at Dammaj, as incubators for the Islamic holy war that bin Laden has declared against the United States. Muqbel says the center, known as Dar al-Hadith, or House of the Prophet's Sayings and Deeds, is strictly a theological school _ albeit one that propagates a purist, militant, stridently anti-Western form of Islam known as Salafism, which Arab and Western scholars say is at the core of bin Laden's beliefs. In effect, Salafism is a still harder-line version of Wahabism, the puritanical form of Islam that bin Laden absorbed during his formative years in Saudi Arabia. The essence of Salafism _ from the Arab word salaf, meaning ancestor _ is that Muslims should shun the corrupt ways of the modern world and return to the austerity and zeal of the Prophet Muhammad, who died nearly 1,400 years ago. At Dammaj, it has become a way of life for at least 3,000 students from all over the Muslim world, particularly from nations with a history of radicalism _ Afghanistan, Algeria, Libya, Somalia and Sudan, even Indonesia and Malaysia. In recent years, dozens of Westerners, mostly of Arab descent, have arrived at the center from the United States and Britain and other European countries. Muqbel says the students stay at least 5 years, sometimes as many as 10 to 15. There are no television sets, no newspapers, no music, no women, no education other than study of the Koran and Islamic teachings, and no electricity, except for purposes judged essential, such as the loudspeakers and antennas used by Muqbel. In the sheik's view, the most dangerous enemies of Islam, before the United States and Israel, are Western life and culture _ democracy, pluralism, tolerance and any kind of voting. In a rare interview five months ago with The Yemen Times, an English-language newspaper, he made the point bluntly. ``In Islam,'' he said, ``there is nothing such as appreciating the viewpoint of a person if it is against Islamic regulations.'' The sheik, who allows no photographs of himself or his centers and rarely meets outsiders, denied that weapons training is part of the curriculum at Dammaj _ something Western diplomats in Sana, the Yemeni capital, say has been suspected for years. In Yemen, where the government says there are 65 million guns for 18 million people, weapons of all kinds can be bought openly, without licenses. The best-equipped arms bazaar in the country, with an inhibiting display of heavy weapons, is in a village not far from Dammaj. In July, the sheik's assurances looked awkward when a 16-year-old British boy, a student at Dammaj, was shot to death, allegedly when a gun his older brother was cleaning accidentally discharged. Twice in two months, two years earlier, the sheik narrowly escaped assassination when bombs exploded outside mosques he controls in Sana and Aden. Faced with embarrassing headlines, the sheik went public. ``Our movement is purely to teach the concepts of the Koran,'' he told The Yemen Times. In any event, he said, it would not be possible for his movement to acquire enough weapons to mount a serious challenge to its enemies. ``We do not have any training camp, and we do not train students in using weapons,'' he said. ``We are a peaceful movement working on spreading the concepts of Islam in a peaceful manner to the students who come from everywhere in the world.'' The Koran, he added, was more powerful than ``rifles, or even tanks.'' All the same, Western intelligence agencies say that Salafists, including many graduates of Dammaj, have been among the most feared fighters in Afghanistan, Algeria, Chechnya and Kashmir. They say that Dammaj and five other centers run by Muqbel across Yemen, even if not military camps, act as ideological proving grounds for young Muslims who go on to train elsewhere, often in Afghanistan, and to become terrorists. Because of Muqbel's tight security, barring access to all but Muslims who have been screened, it is virtually impossible for outsiders _ even Yemeni government officials _ to know what is going on inside the center. But it takes little time traveling through this region to discover how hospitable a terrain this can be for bin Laden and his beliefs. Muqbel's title is a religious one, adopted after a lifetime spent teaching his militant brand of Islam in Yemen and Saudi Arabia. It was in Saudi Arabia where he spent three months in jail in the early 1980s for his links to a militant Islamic group that in 1979 occupied the holiest shrine in Islam at Mecca, setting off a showdown in which hundreds were killed. But not far from Dammaj, there are dozens of other sheiks, a title that can also mean a tribal leader, and they represent the old Bedouin ruling class that still controls vast stretches of land that arc around Yemen's tense 1,500-mile frontier with Saudi Arabia. Resentful of the 20th-century rise of powerful national governments in Yemen and Saudi Arabia, the northern tribal leaders have long regarded bin Laden _ one of more than 50 children of Muhammad bin Laden, a Yemeni who immigrated as a porter to Saudi Arabia in 1931 and built one of the Middle East's largest construction companies _ as a potential ally. Three years ago, said one of the tribal sheiks, this resulted in a secret encounter that brought together 30 tribal sheiks with two emissaries sent by bin Laden from Afghanistan, where he has been hiding since 1996. Bin Laden's purpose, it was said, was to seek the tribal leaders' consent to move to Yemen _ a desire he acknowledged shortly before in an interview with Al Quds al Arabi, an Arab-language newspaper published in London. Sheik Muhammad bin Shajea, who controls an area of thousands of square miles deep in the desert along the Saudi Arabian border, said in an interview at his desert fort at Al Atfein, about 100 miles northeast of Dammaj, that he was among the tribal leaders who met the emissaries in the spring of 1997, at a tribal leader's home in Sana. He said terms were discussed for bin Laden's taking sanctuary somewhere in the sheiks' domains, where the writ of the national government barely reaches. ``They call him a terrorist, but that's what those in authority always say when they are challenged,'' the sheik said. ``We say, where is the impartial court to say whether it's bin Laden who is the terrorist, or his enemies? From our point of view, he's not only a great religious scholar, he's a Yemeni, even if his nationality is Saudi Arabian. So for us, his presence in Yemen would be quite natural.'' On its face, Sheik bin Shajea's candor about the offer could embarrass the Yemeni government, which has insisted that those who bombed the Cole are part of an international terrorist network, in all probability directed by bin Laden. (In an interview last week, President Ali Abdullah Saleh said evidence was still lacking to identify bin Laden positively as responsible for the bombing, but other high officials said they were ``personally convinced,'' based on the accumulating evidence, that bin Laden had conceived and directed the attack.) Bin Shajea said he and other sheiks had deep sympathy for bin Laden's Islamic beliefs, if not for his methods. But Yemenis who know the sheik say that he may have been grinding a different axe: the bitter dispute between the northern tribal chiefs and Saleh, over a June border agreement with Saudi Arabia that will cut sharply into the desert domains of the sheiks. These are thought to be rich with oil potential that would make traditional revenues from smuggling appear paltry. Saleh has vowed to proceed with the border pact to end a sometimes bloody dispute with Saudi Arabia that has simmered for 70 years, but bin Shajea, among others, has vowed to kill any survey teams seeking to demarcate a new border. In effect, the sheiks seem to be telling Saleh that they are prepared to make alliances wherever they can, even with bin Laden. For its part, the government dismisses bin Shajea as a turncoat: at one time, it says, a clandestine agent for Saudi Arabia, later an ally of Saleh's, now, apparently, a cohort of bin Laden's. And senior officials even question whether the meeting with the bin Laden emissaries occurred _ or occurred in the form the sheik claims. ``Sheik bin Shajea is the biggest liar in Yemen,'' one high-ranking official said. In Yemen, bin Laden would find deep deserts and high mountains in which to hide as well as a central government with little penetration in the tribal lands. In a sign he still has a Yemeni sanctuary in mind, bin Laden appeared for his most recent videotape attack on the United States _ relayed throughout the Middle East three weeks before the Cole bombing _ wearing the long dishdasha gown, and tribal dagger, favored in the Yemeni province that is his family's ancestral home. In the 1996 interview with Al Quds al Arabi, bin Laden acknowledged he could not return to Sudan, where he operated until driven out by American pressure earlier that year. ``The choice is between Afghanistan and Yemen,'' he said then. ``The geography of Yemen is mountainous, and its people are armed tribespeople. It allows one to breathe clean air without humiliation.'' When Al Quds al Arabi's editor, Abdel Bari Atwan, asked if a move would be ``with or without the knowledge of the Yemeni government,'' bin Laden replied, ``Either.'' Already, Saleh, the Yemeni leader, seems tightly constrained in what he can do about the goings on at Dammaj, only five miles from Sadah, the regional government headquarters for northern Yemen. Before visiting Dammaj, this reporter was warned that Muqbel and his followers regard Western reporters as only slightly better than spies. Upon arrival, an armed guard at the study center's gate announced that Muqbel was away, being treated for a chronic liver ailment somewhere outside Yemen. Left free to wander, three visitors _ a reporter and two Arab-speaking companions _ plunged into the unchanging world of traditional Arabia. Just past dawn, the sun was casting a pinkish glow across the desert's honey-colored sand, the broad fronds of the oil palm trees and the mud-brick walls of the forts and homes. Students were stirring for the day's first prayers, and for the ritual wash that precedes them. From a nearby mosque, a muezzin's plaintive chants rang out across the desert, summoning the faithful to prayer. Initially, nobody showed much interest in the strangers moving along narrow alleyways, looking over the high walls of the center at the large, open-air auditorium with a corrugated-iron roof. It is the place the sheik delivers fire-breathing sermons that heap scorn on Christians and Jews, calling them, among other things, ``brothers of apes and pigs.'' Above the center's heavy steel gates, a lone sign proclaimed: ``Convert, and God will show you the way.'' Small boys on their way to school paused to chat. Ali, an 8-year-old orphan, spoke with passion about Muqbel, saying that the sheik had given homes to poor people. Older men followed, Libyans and Indonesians, Turks and Malaysians and Yemenis. But when a visitor became too adventurous, asking what the men thought of the United States, the mood changed to anger in a flash. Omar _ a Libyan who said he was 32 years old, dressed in white robes and a cylindrical black cap identifying him as a talib or religious student _ shook his fist and said: ``America can't do anything! It's God who commands everything, not America. America is nothing!'' An older man, also in white robes, accompanied by the armed guard who had been mounting a wary watch on the visitors, was summoned. The older man turned menacing, demanding passports, asking if the visitors were Americans, and implying they were spies on a reconnaissance mission. During several minutes of interrogation, a guard at the older man's side ostentatiously fingered the trigger of his Kalashnikov. But after retreating to talk quietly to yet another armed man, the older man turned and waved angrily in the direction of the open desert. With dust billowing behind them, the visitors reversed their four-wheel vehicle rapidly back up the alleyway. Turning the vehicle around and hardly daring to look back, they headed out across the bumpy desert, back toward the relative safety of what government control there is, the regional capital of Sadah.

Bombed by NATO during the Kosovo war and then burned by pro-democracy demonstrators, Serbia's state television and radio network remains an enormous prize for the new authorities as they work toward consolidating power in elections for a new Serbian government on Dec. 23. How they handle the bloated and degraded network is also a test of whether the new leaders, and the journalists themselves, can really break with the authoritarian past. Initial signs are discouraging. The new leaders, gathered in a broad 18-party coalition still known as the Democratic Opposition of Serbia, or DOS, have applied considerable political pressure on the temporary managers of the broadcasting empire. In general, even without the obvious abuses of the past, the journalists have slipped easily into being cheerleaders for the new democrats. Along with the police and the army, state television was considered an essential pillar of Slobodan Milosevic's 13-year rule. Its newscasts glorified the government, smeared the opposition, demonized the West, distorted facts and history and helped inspire Serbs to patriotism, paranoia, nationalism, conquest and war crimes against their neighbors. The network, owned by the government of Serbia and known by its initials, RTS, was among the first targets of the demonstrators who pushed Vojislav Kostunica into power. On Oct. 5, the downtown studios were seized and burned and the network's director, Dragoljub Milanovic, was nearly beaten to death. About 9 p.m., with the police capitulating and army troops remaining in their barracks, it was on Serbian state television that Kostunica wanted to show his face, to symbolize that he and his allies were now in charge. He was driven to a suburban studio with a handpicked interviewer, cameraman and editor. His words were not especially memorable, but for many Serbs his appearance was the real confirmation that Milosevic's power had crumbled. ``RTS represents not just a media problem but a problem of the whole society,'' said Snjezana Milivojevic, who has studied RTS for over a decade. ``We need a new legal and moral framework, with institutional guarantees, to ensure that the last 10 years can never happen again.'' Milivojevic, who is on a panel compiling new media regulations, said the future of the media in Yugoslavia would depend on the way RTS reorganized. But despite talk in the first days of the revolution about a ``new'' RTS _ democratic, open and free from undue political influence _ the new leaders seem reluctant to allow much independence. They have provided political advice and instructions on what to cover and whom to invite from the first night, Oct. 5, said Gordana Susa, the acting editor in chief of news at RTS. She heads an independent television production company and is president of the Independent Journalists Association of Serbia. ``Some leaders of the opposition act in the old way and want to put everything under their control,'' Susa said. ``Every day there is pressure from the political parties.'' The open pressure is especially troubling, Susa said, because the network's employees are so accustomed to toadying to power and so frightened for their jobs that they would favor the new authorities without even being asked. In the meantime, she admits, the news is awful: boring, predictable and uncritical. Zarko Korac, leader of a party in the coalition that unseated Milosevic, said the television presented ``a Darwinian problem of natural selection.'' Current employees ``can't think and just follow political instructions _ they couldn't make good programs even if they wanted to.'' Milivoje Mihajlovic, who worked for RTS, said it remained Serbia's worst television. ``It's obvious they still work in the same way. They've just changed their master.'' The problems are similar at Politika, the once respected state newspaper that became a mouthpiece for Milosevic. ``Of course people in RTS and Politika do what they are used to doing,'' said Aleksandar Nenadovic, 72, who was fired as Politika's editor by Tito, Yugoslavia's Communist ruler for 35 years. ``It's a function of the level of political evolution here. Everything is in ruins, so everyone is trying to reserve a place for themselves, and with the elections it's crucial to maintain control.'' Susa said the problems stemmed in part from the appointment of Nenad Ristic as acting director. Ristic, 60, ran RTS from 1985 to 1990 and then moved, under political pressure, to producing harmless shows, he said, about ``ecology, bugs and insects.'' Susa said, ``DOS called an old man to be the new general manager who accepts all their requests.'' The station's crisis committee, acting like a temporary management board, has fired him four times, but ``each time,'' she said, ``DOS tells them to calm down and not create chaos'' before the elections. The new authorities also put pressure on RTS to stop a documentary about the way the station had been used to foment war and hatred, and then urged that further segments be shown late at night. ``It was DOS's first effort to censor us,'' Susa said. Ristic says he is doing his best with a bad situation. He has brought key editors back from 1990 and urged about 60 people, editors and prominent reporters most associated with the old regime, not to come to work ``for their own safety.'' He has banned well-known faces from the air. As for the news, Ristic said, ``there is slavishness, and it's true that DOS gets most of the airtime.'' As the election nears, with other parties more active, there has been some improvement in balance. RTS currently has 8,018 employees on its books, Ristic said _ twice as many as CNN employs worldwide. While salaries for all but the loftiest were meager _ between 2,000 and 3,000 dinars a month, about $33 to $50 _ RTS had become a kind of social welfare agency for journalists too untalented or afraid to seek work elsewhere. Caught between a vague desire to modernize and a stronger wish to avoid violence, Ristic seems reluctant to let go even the most incompetent or compromised journalists. ``The first night we agreed there would be no revenge'' against those who served Milosevic, Ristic said. ``Most journalists here felt they had to do it. They didn't do it because they believed in it.'' But Mihajlovic says that too many journalists were working for the Milosevic regime, and journalists must take responsibility for their own profession. ``We have a dirty yard, and someone has to clean it. It would be better if journalists did, to teach people not to let it happen again. I think there is already too much forgiveness.'' Mihajlovic was an editor at Radio Pristina, and says there was both censorship and self-censorship. He has been asked to return to work in nearby Prokuplje to help cover Kosovo. ``They said to me, `You were kicked out, you were not theirs.' But I said: `I have to be honest. I worked as honestly as I could, but I was their editor. I don't have the moral right to pretend otherwise. I stayed. I needed the money to feed my family. I know I have to pay for that in one way or another.''' Mihajlovic's candor is rare. Ruzica Vranjkovic, 35, was an editor of the last evening news while covering energy. She still covers energy, but she is not allowed to have her face on television. ``It's silly,'' she said, but doesn't argue. ``Everything's unsettled, and there's a lot of fear. People treated it like a job. It was hard to stay, but I worked to live.''

North and South Korea have pledged to step up economic cooperation. The agreement was announced Saturday in Seoul as the two sides wound up their latest round of ministerial level talks. North and South Korean negotiators agreed to set up a joint committee to discuss the supply of badly needed electricity to the poverty stricken North and the establishment of roads and rail links between the once bitter rivals. The two sides agreed to hold a third round of family reunions in February and to work on the North's proposal to share fishing grounds near the border.

Mexican authorities have ordered the evacuation of 14,000 people living near the Popocatapital volcano, sixty kilometers east of Mexico City. The volcano has increased its activity in the past few days, spewing ash and smoke over an eighty kilometer radius. More details from Cindy Lavenderos in Mexico City. People are reluctantly leaving their homes after government authorities ordered the evacuation of villages within 13 kilometers of the smoking volcano. But not all villagers have agreed to lock up their homes and go. They fear their belongings may not be there when they return, despite the army presence in the area. Government officials say they ordered the evacuation as a preventive measure. This past week El Popo, as the volcano is commonly called, entered a new phase of activity spreading ash and smoke over an eighty-kilometer radius. Ash reached as far as Mexico City causing some International airlines to cancel their flights into Mexico City airport. Earthquake detectors at the National Disaster Prevention Center have recorded erratic and unfamiliar activity within the crater. Experts fear the volcano could begin spewing lava. Buses began taking villagers from seven communities near the slopes of the volcano to temporary government shelters. Another 35,000 people are making preparations to leave if conditions get worse. The volcano has been emitting gas, ash and rock intermittently since December 1994, after remaining largely dormant since 1927. It has been 800 years since Popocatapital's last catastrophic eruption. Cindy Lavenderos for VOA News in Mexico City.

Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit has said his government would seek to override a presidential veto and send an amnesty bill designed to reduce the prison population back to parliament for approval, newspapers said Sunday. President Ahmet Necdet Sezer refused to approve the bill on Friday saying it was unfair and could harm trust in justice and laws. The bill, which reduces sentences by 10 years, would allow for the release of nearly half of the nation's 72,000 inmates. It is aimed at reforming the country's troubled prison system. Ecevit said Saturday he would send the bill back to parliament this week, Hurriyet newspaper said. If parliament re-approves the bill without making any changes, then Sezer cannot veto the bill for a second time. He can however, ask the Constitutional Court to cancel the bill. Meanwhile, hunger strikes in the country's prisons entered 59th day on Sunday, with doctors warning of imminent deaths. Some 250 prisoners linked to militant leftist groups are protesting planned transfers from their dormitory-style wards to one- or three-person cells. Several inmates launched the strike on Oct. 20 while others joined in the following weeks. The inmates say the cells would leave them vulnerable to abuse by authorities. They are refusing medical treatment and drinking only water. Mediation efforts were halted Friday and Justice Minister Hikmet Sami Turk rejected the prisoners demand to be housed in 20-person rooms as ``unacceptable.'' The government said it would bear no responsibility if the inmates die. On Sunday, human rights activists asked Turk to immediately resume negotiations. ``We don't want anyone to die,'' Husnu Odul, president of Turkey's Human Rights Association. The government wants to break up the large wards, which it cannot control and where riots and hostage-takings are frequent. Political inmates run their wards like an indoctrination center with military discipline.

Mexico's Popocatepetl volcano belched incandescent fragments and a towering plume of ash and vapor early Sunday while scientists urged nearby residents to stay away, uncertain of what the mountain will do next. A dome of lava has formed at the base of the 17,886-foot volcano, causing pressure to build up inside and slowing the eruptions Saturday after one of mountain's most active weeks in two years. Comparing the volcano to a blocked pressure cooker, scientists are concerned that the building pressure could trigger a strong eruption, possibly throwing rocks and other debris for several miles. After several hours of low-level earthquakes, the volcano spewed incandescent fragments that flew just under a mile from its crater early Sunday, followed hours later by a plume of ash and steam more than a mile high. Scientists warned that stronger eruptions are possible in the next few days, and they urged people living within six miles of the volcano to leave. The last evacuation occurred six years ago, shortly after the volcano became active again after lying dormant since 1927. It has been 800 years since its last catastrophic eruption. The volcano, locally known as ``Popo,'' sits 40 miles southeast of Mexico City, one of the world's largest cities. Yet a major eruption would do little more than dust the metropolitan area's 20 million residents with ash. At higher risk are the small communities dotting the volcano's base. Officials have called on some 40,000 people to leave about two dozen communities near the volcano, but residents have largely ignored the buses and cars sent to shuttle them to safer areas. About 10,000 people have reportedly left, staying in schools and other makeshift shelters where hot meals and medical care are being provided. The volcano has been shooting out vapor, ash and rock intermittently since December 1994, and many say they don't see how this week's activity is more dangerous than past eruptions. Others fear their homes will be robbed and their livestock left to go hungry if they leave, despite the fact that the army has been sent to take care of the area. On Sunday, clouds concealed the volcano _ and its occasional eruption. Earlier in the week, many walked around the streets with medical masks over their mouths to avoid breathing the falling ash. Scientists are largely concerned by the volcano's unprecedented recent seismic activity. Many of the tremors this week have shaken nearby towns. On Thursday, the volcano threw ash over a 50-mile radius, and on Tuesday, it erupted 200 times, a record number for a single day.

The United Nations is withdrawing most of its foreign staff from Afghanistan, fearing that disgruntled Afghans could react to further U.N. sanctions with retaliatory attacks. ``We are scaling down,'' Stephanie Bunker, U.N. spokeswoman in neighboring Pakistan, said Monday. More than 30 people have left Afghanistan in the past week, and more were expected to depart from its war-ravaged capital, Kabul, on Tuesday. The U.N. Security Council is expected to pass a resolution this week seeking new sanctions against Afghanistan's ruling Taliban religious militia. The measures would limit the travel of Taliban officials, reduce staff at their diplomatic missions outside the country and impose an arms embargo. About 50 U.N. staffers are believed to work in Afghanistan. But the United Nations is reluctant to give details about the departures because ``we don't want to create panic in Afghanistan,'' Bunker said. Despite assurances from the ruling Taliban that it will provide security for U.N. humanitarian workers, officials from the global body are nervous. ``It is not that we are concerned that they can't provide the security, but in a sensitive situation anything could go wrong,'' Bunker said. Sponsored by the United States and Russia, the resolution demands the Taliban hand over suspected Saudi terrorist Osama bin Laden to either the United States or a third country for trial on charges of terrorism. The Clinton administration believes bin Laden is running a terrorist network from his bases in Afghanistan. The Taliban deny the accusations, refuse to hand over bin Laden and warn that further sanctions will hurt the ordinary Afghans. ``By slapping the sanctions on Afghanistan and exaggerating the issue of terrorism, America wants to maintain its military presence in the Middle East,'' said a statement issued by the Taliban's embassy in Pakistan. It said it fears Russia is also trying to reassert its influence in the region. The Taliban sharply criticized the United Nations for sanctions when the country is experiencing its worst drought in 30 years and when the Islamic militia has issued a ban on poppy production. Poppy, the raw material used to make heroin, is one of the largest cash crops for poor Afghans. Non-U.N. humanitarian aid groups have opposed more sanctions, warning that they could intensify the sense of isolation among Afghans who have already endured 21 years of war. Sanctions and threats of more sanctions also have weakened the Afghan currency and driven up food costs. The World Food Program has warned that as many as 1 million people face serious food shortages and many could die of starvation during Afghanistan's bitter winter. Bunker said the United Nations expects to continue its aid programs even with the reduced staff. The programs would be operated by Afghan employees. While promising to protect U.N. humanitarian workers, the Taliban say they will boycott peace talks mediated by the United Nations if further sanctions are imposed. In November 1999, the United Nations imposed limited sanctions banning international travel by Afghanistan's national airlines and freezing Taliban assets abroad.

Residents of many small towns at the base of Mexico's Popocatepetl volcano stayed up until dawn Monday, fearing the mountain's overnight rumblings were signs that a stronger eruption was brewing. Officials have urged some 40,000 people living within six miles of the volcano to leave the area, but most have ignored the pleas, preferring to stay behind to guard their belongings and livestock. About 10,000 people have fled, and buses were parked along roadsides waiting to shuttle more people to shelters in safe areas.

It's been one step forward and two steps back for the international effort to combat global warming. The one step forward came three years ago, when much of the world agreed to reduce the emission of gases, playing for pushing up world temperatures. The two steps back came last month when efforts to implement the agreement broke down in The Hague and today, when another attempt failed to bring the parties together in Brussels. The World's Carol Hills reports. In the end it was a phone call this morning that convinced Frank Loy, the Under-Secretary of State for Global Affairs, that this latest effort to resuscitate the talks on reducing Green House gas emissions was over. Loy says the position of the United States, Japan, Australia, New Zealand and Canada is too far from the European Union. We have concluded along with our three other umbrella group countries that the conditions for a successful meeting are by no means there and that therefore it would be better not to meet and have another failure. The Hague talks last month collapsed over the same issue. That is, what qualifies as an emission reduction toward the Kyoto Accord goal of 5%, by 2010. The United States insists on emissions trading. The United States, for example, would get credit if an American company built a wind farm in a developing country, even though the United States in that case would not be cutting its own emissions. Under-Secretary Loy also insists, the so-called Carbon Sinks should count toward the 5% reduction. Carbon Sinks are the force on farmland that suck up carbon dioxide. These are methods that were agreed upon at Kyoto, in our opinion, as methods that were available to parties to achieve their goals. And they, I think, are serious efforts to restrict both the use of Sinks, but also the use of Emission Trading as methods to achieve those targets. Europe thinks they are simply ways of the United States to avoid real action on Green House gas reduction. Keelaputty Ramakrishna of the Woods Hall Research Center says there's plenty of blame to go around, but the Clinton administration has nothing to be proud of. The United States obviously takes the major blame in not being able to engage the EU until too late, in not being able to engage developing countries until too late. I think we all should take blame. In our anxiety to craft the perfect agreement, we threw away a great opportunity in terms of agreeing on something and then making progress with that as the starting point. Ramakrishna says a new starting point is likely to be way off. American officials, who have been deeply involved in the Green House gas negotiations, are about to be out of a job. And few believe that the first item on former oilman George W Bush's agenda is reducing Green House gas. For The World, I am Carol Hills.

A volcano near Mexico City spouted showers of incandescent rock and ash late Monday, one of Popocatepetl's biggest eruptions since returning to life six years ago. Television showed footage of Monday's lava shower, which spread against the night sky like a fireworks show and prompted some residents of small, nearby towns to finally heed officials' pleas to evacuate. It was unclear how far down the flanks the lava was falling, but it appeared only about a half mile down the slope. The eruption appeared to be the largest emission of molten rock from the peak since it rumbled back from a 70-year period of dormancy in 1994. The nearest villages, almost all now completely evacuated, are about 4 miles away. Television footage showed people boarding evacuation buses in other towns within the 6-mile danger zone around the peak. With sirens wailing, police drove through the deserted streets of Santiago Xalitzintla, one of the closest villages, shouting through bullhorns for the few remaining inhabitants to leave. Some refused. ``It could have been worse if this had been a brief, extremely violent eruption,'' said Servando de la Cruz, a scientist at the National Autonomous University of Mexico. ``It was a relatively moderate emission that lasted about an hour.'' ``In the next few hours, we'll have to see if more energy builds up,'' De la Cruz said. ``These kind of events could be repeated.'' The volcano also spewed a cloud of ash 2.5 miles high, which appeared to be blowing away from Mexico City, 40 miles northwest of the peak. President Vicente Fox went into an emergency, late-night meeting with members of his Cabinet to discuss the eruption. Up until now, there have been no forced evacuations in the two dozen villages around the volcano. Even as van-loads of residents fled down the slopes in the minutes after the eruption, some of those living within the 6-mile danger zone around the peak said they still would not leave. Since Saturday, the government has been urging some 40,000 people to leave the highest-risk area. Until Monday, most had disregarded the pleas, preferring to stay behind to guard their belongings and livestock. But deep rumbling from the volcano overnight, and the spectacular shower of red-hot rock over the high flanks of the peak Monday, prompted more locals to pack their cars. ``They already told us to leave, but we didn't believe them _ until last night. Now we are scared,'' said Javier Hernandez, 71, huddled around a fire with five other men. Six female relatives slept under blankets in the back of a nearby pickup. ``We didn't sleep at all last night,'' he said. ``It was thundering loudly.'' More than 10,000 people have fled, and buses were parked along roadsides waiting to shuttle more to shelters in safe areas. Scientists have warned that lava at the base of the 17,886-foot Popocatepetl (pronounced poh-poh-kah-TEH-peh-til) is causing pressure to build inside the mountain. That could trigger a strong eruption, throwing rocks and other debris for miles. ``It's like a pressure cooker,'' Interior Secretary Santiago Creel said. ``It could lead to a situation the likes of which we've never seen.'' The volcano, locally known as ``Popo'' or ``Don Goyo,'' sits 40 miles southeast of Mexico City. A major eruption is unlikely to do more than dust the metropolitan area's 20 million residents with ash. But some airlines have canceled flights to Mexico City for fear that ash already spewed by the volcano may damage their engines. The last evacuation occurred in December 1994, when the volcano came back to life after lying dormant since 1927. It has been 800 years since its last catastrophic eruption.

Every thousand years or so, the great Popocatepetl explodes with killing force, and as it rumbled and puffed this weekend, government officials monitoring geophysicists' instruments pleaded with thousands of villagers under the volcano to flee. Few did. People fought to stay put, even after it erupted violently throughout Monday night and Tuesday morning, flinging glowing 5-foot rocks for miles, in what is believed to be its biggest bang in more than a millennium. They felt strongly that the volcano _ their volcano, revered as the god of rain and giver of rich soil _ was more benevolent a force than their government. ``The people in the villages consider Popo a friendly volcano, the beating heart of the land,'' said Homero Aridjis, a poet, former diplomat and president of PEN, the international writers' association. ``It's our Indian beliefs against European science.'' Maybe they were right: Though the mountain is hurling incandescent bombs, potentially threatening everyone for 20 miles around, it has killed no one yet. But this clash of verities versus technology _ or human nature against nature _ is an old story. And since the volcano still is capable of an immense explosion, it is far from over. Scientists and the government continued to warn that there could be a full-blown eruption, with rivers of lava pouring down the slopes. The volcano is visible from Mexico City, a metropolis of 18 million people 40 miles to the northwest. So far, winds have carried the ash and smoke south, sparing the city a rain of soot that some had feared would clog the already polluted air and shut down its busy airport. All day Monday and Tuesday, government sound trucks went through villages near the volcano, blaring warnings, church bells rang out danger and army commanders appeared with evacuation orders. But thousands resisted the call. Vicente Jimenez, a 26-year-old corn farmer from Santiago Xanitzintla, about 7 miles from the flaming crater, heard all the alarms and was unmoved. ``We never left,'' he said on Tuesday. ``We don't feel comfortable leaving our homes and everything we own in the hands of the authorities. For many people leaving was hard enough, but leaving our homes in the hands of the police is even harder.'' A fellow farmer who stayed behind, Adolfo Castro, 55, said: ``This is a very old village. The church is important to us, and there was no one guarding it. There are antiquities inside that go back centuries.'' An army commander charged with carrying out an evacuation on Tuesday shook his head. ``It's too late to be fighting with these people,'' he said. ``They've shut themselves in behind four locks. They are older people who will never leave.'' More than 20,000 people appeared to have turned down the government's offers of transportation, food and shelter. ``Their resistance is reasonable, based on their experience,'' said Luis Gonzalez y Gonzalez, a historian at the National College. ``The people have nothing to identify with but their families and their land.'' After nearly seven decades of deep sleep, 17,945-foot Popocatepetl (pronounced poh-poh-kah-TEH-peh-tel) became active again in December 1994. Since then, government scientists have erected a world-class monitoring network of sensors around it, measuring its internal pressure and recording its smallest tremors. The Mexican government also set up 1,232 shelters with room for more than 300,000 people. It accurately predicted the eruption, broadcast the warning clearly and yet could not persuade people to leave through reason alone. Part of this resistance lies in village traditions. People call the volcano Don Gregorio or Don Goyo for short, and see him as a living, giving creature. Shamans in the villages communicate with him and insist he will not hurt people unless people hurt him. ``People here still carry gifts up the mountain, a stewpot of turkey with mole, a basket of fruits,'' said Tomas Jimenez, Vicente's father, who said his family has lived in Santiago Xanitzintla for centuries. ``They ask for a better harvest or more rain.'' Part of the fight against flight has an even deeper foundation, though. ``It's human nature,'' said Dan Miller, a research geologist and the chief of the U.S. Volcano Disaster Assistance Program, which is based in Vancouver, Wash., and has worked in more than a dozen countries, throughout Latin America, Asia and Africa. ``Wherever we go in the world we have met with the same kind of problem,'' said Miller, whose program is run by the U.S. Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance and the U.S. Geological Survey. ``People who live in high-risk zones around volcanoes don't expect an eruption to take place, and if it did, they don't expect it to affect them. Government scientists in the U.S. and elsewhere meet with mistrust when they issue proclamations or recommendations. People don't understand or believe their warnings.'' The same thing happened during Mount St. Helen's eruption in Washington state 20 years ago. ``When Mount St. Helen's woke up after 123 years, a fair number of people refused to be evacuated, and many of the 57 people killed had illegally entered into closed-off and restricted areas,'' Miller said. Late last year in Ecuador, at least 22,000 villagers were evacuated by the government when the 16,475-foot volcano called Tungurahua _ ``Throat of Fire'' in the Quechua Indian language _ showed signs that a violent explosion was coming. ``Now 15 months have gone by and the predicted devastating events haven't occurred,'' Miller said. ``And the people have fought their way through military barricades back home. And they're there now, even though the eruptions continue.'' On Tuesday evening, though some villages were all but deserted, it appeared that roughly 30,000 people _ slightly more than half of the 56,000 people the government wanted to protect _ had accepted the offer of shelter, said Santiago Creel, the interior minister. Creel, who like the rest of the government of President Vicente Fox has been in power only 18 days, said he saw the futility of forcing the others to leave. ``We don't think there's a clear way for us to remove the whole population,'' he said.

in mexico today, 40 miles southeast of mexico city, the volcano erupted. the volcano called popocatepetl which is the only time we'll try to pronounce it accurately. the mexicans call it el popo. and this is its most spectacular eruption in 1,200 years. the volcano has been giving off warning signs for several days, which were largely ignored by many of the people living nearby -- until today. here is abc's ned potter. finally, they began to get the message that the mountain was dangerous. 41,000 near the volcano were urged to leave -- herded into buses, loaded onto trucks. "it started erupting when we left," said this man.

Turkey's attempt to regain control of its prisons ended in bloodshed Tuesday, with two soldiers killed while storming the prisons and at least 15 inmates dead _ many from choosing to burn themselves alive rather than surrender. The government, pressing to break up wards controlled by inmates, raided the prisons to prevent some 250 hunger strikers from starving themselves. Inmates linked to outlawed leftist groups launched the hunger strike more than two months ago to protest government plans to transfer them from their wards to new prisons equipped with small cells, where they fear they will be more vulnerable to abuse by authorities. The government says the only way it can regain control of its prisons _ often rocked by riots and hostage takings _ is by breaking up the large wards, which it says political groups run like indoctrination centers. ``From now on the state's sovereignty ... will be realized ... in prisons,'' Justice Minister Hikmet Sami Turk said. After intense fighting, soldiers succeeded in forcing inmates out of the wards in 18 of the 20 prisons they stormed. Armed inmates were still resisting in Istanbul's Umraniye prison and in a prison in the western city of Canakkale. The Interior Ministry said 78 inmates were injured in the clashes, and another 821 inmates on a hunger strike were hospitalized. Turk said the inmates in Istanbul's Bayrampasa prison were armed with AK-47 assault rifles, a claim disputed by Ozgur Tayad, a prisoners' support group. In two prisons, authorities broke through the walls of the wards, and in at least one case soldiers dropped onto a prison roof from helicopters. Turk said 15 inmates died Tuesday, most after setting themselves on fire. Ozgur Tayad said at least eight had been killed by soldiers. One soldier was killed in clashes in Umraniye and another in a prison in Canakkale, Turk said. The government gave no details on how the soldiers died. Ozgur Tayad said the soldiers were killed in cross fire. Turkey's independent Human Rights Association disputed Turk's figures, saying that up to 17 inmates had been killed or committed suicide by setting themselves ablaze, with 12 apparently committing suicide in Bayrampasa alone. Ozgur Tayad said 20 were killed. There was no immediate explanation for the discrepancies. Transfers to the new prisons began after soldiers secured the wards. Across Turkey, hundreds of people were detained for demonstrating against the prison raids. Scores of people were injured in the protests in Istanbul. New York-based Human Rights Watch condemned the assault. ``These deaths were entirely avoidable,'' Jonathan Sugden, Turkey researcher for Human Rights Watch, said in a statement released in New York. ``The current crisis in Turkish prisons could have been resolved with patience, transparency and a readiness to consult.'' The government and radical, armed political groups have long been fighting over control of the wards. Last year, 10 leftist inmates were killed when soldiers stormed an Ankara prison to put an end to a riot. Also in 1999, Islamic militants injured 54 soldiers and took more than 100 prison guards hostage to protest plans to move them from their ward. To political prisoners, remaining in the wards is not only a question of protecting themselves from abuse, some analysts say. Human rights groups say that torture is common in Turkish prisons and that leftists and Kurds are often singled out for abuse. Most senior members of leftist organizations such as the Revolutionary People's Liberation Party-Front _ the group that most of the hunger strikers are linked to _ also are in jail and the wards are one of their main sources of power. Prisoners follow party discipline in the wards, and there are even cases of ward leaders killing followers who are not obedient, according to Human Rights Watch. The People's Liberation Party has more than 1,000 followers in prison, a number that some experts say exceeds their membership outside of prison. Dogu Ergil, political sociology professor at Ankara University and an expert on leftist groups, said the inmates' refusal to surrender could also be seen as an attempt by the group to prove that they are still strong. The battle with the soldiers ``is a message to the group that they are very much alive and can continue,'' said Ergil. ``But this is also a sign of desperation because they can do nothing else but annihilate themselves.'' Turkey has pledged to reform its judicial system, including abolishing numerous freedom-curbing laws, in its effort to join the European Union, which accepted Ankara as a candidate last year.

The ruling Taliban militia responded Wednesday to harsh new U.N. sanctions, pulling out of U.N.-mediated peace talks on ending Afghanistan's civil war and refusing any handover of terrorism suspect Osama bin Laden to the United States. The Taliban also ordered an immediate boycott of products from the United States and Russia _ who sponsored the U.N. Security Council resolution to impose sanctions. The Security Council on Tuesday gave the Taliban a month to surrender bin Laden, suspected in the bombing of U.S. embassies in Africa, and close ``terrorist'' training camps. It threatened sanctions such as further restrictions on international flights. The move sparked anger in Afghanistan, ravaged by 20 years of war, brutal poverty and persistent drought. ``These are cruel sanctions, unjust, irrational and unilateral,'' Mullah Abdul Zalam Zaeef, the Taliban's ambassador to Pakistan, told a news conference. The Taliban called a halt to U.N.-mediated talks with the opposition fighters they are battling in the northern part of the country and promised to close the office of the U.N. negotiator and expel its eight-person staff when the sanctions take effect. Other U.N. and charity aid workers won't be affected. All U.N. international staffers already have left Afghanistan, fearing a backlash. The boycott is mostly symbolic since Afghans, among the poorest people in the world, can't afford the few U.S. products on the market here, such as cigarettes and candy. Still, some equipment runs on Russian or U.S. technology and would need spare parts. And Foreign Minister Wakil Ahmed Muttawakil urged all Islamic countries to support a boycott ``to hurt the economy of these countries.'' A resident in Kabul echoed the thoughts of many on the streets of the beleaguered Afghan capital. ``Step by step the international community is killing Afghanistan,'' said Mohammed Zahir, 55. ``Slowly, slowly they are letting us die.'' The United States and Russia, former superpower rivals over Afghanistan, lobbied the 13 other U.N. Security Council members hard to adopt the resolution. They argued the country was a ``haven of lawlessness'' whose hard-line Islamic rulers protect terrorists at home and support terrorism abroad. The sanctions also call for an arms embargo on the Taliban, ban international travel by Taliban officials and close Taliban offices outside the country. U.S. and Russian officials say humanitarian exemptions mitigate any impact on ordinary Afghans. Taliban leaders have refused to hand bin Laden over. They also have denied allegations they allow the operation of camps used to train Chechen rebels, who are fighting for independence from Russia. ``Our position on Osama is unchanged,'' Information Minister Qadratullah Jamal told The Associated Press on Wednesday in Kabul. ``There is no evidence against Osama. ... The United States and Russia are using the excuse of Osama and terrorism but really it is the Islamic system of the Taliban they want to destroy.'' Some at the United Nations had worried that the sanctions move would sabotage efforts to put together talks between the Taliban, who rule 95 percent of Afghanistan, and opposition forces still battling in the north. Russian Ambassador Sergey Lavrov doubted a new round of talks announced last month would have resulted in progress anyway. Aid groups and U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan objected to the resolution on grounds it would increase the suffering of ordinary Afghans. Several council members, including France, the Netherlands and Canada, expressed similar concerns. China and Malaysia abstained. But no one was willing to block the resolution outright since opposition would amount to support for the Taliban army, which has imposed a strict brand of Islam in the parts of Afghanistan it controls. The Taliban bans women from working, limits schooling for girls, imposes harsh and public punishments, and requires men to pray in the mosque and grow beards Neighboring Pakistan objected more strenuously: It warned Wednesday that the sanctions will add to a humanitarian disaster at its doorstep. Thousands of Afghans took up a vigil on the border pleading with Pakistan to open its gates. Poor Pakistan receives limited international aid and no U.N. assistance to feed or house the 2 million Afghan refugees already living in the country.

One of the first actions taken by Mexico's new President, Vicente Fox after he took office on December 1st was to reach out to the mostly indigenous Indian rebels in the Southern State of Chapas and in hopes of ending their seven year conflict. But as VOA's Greg Flakus reports from Mexico City, Mr. Fox's proposal is as controversial as the unresolved war. In his speeches immediately after assuming power, President Fox promised to seek a quick end to the conflict in Chapas by meeting most of the demands of the guerillas known as the Zapatistas. He said he would seek peace in Chapas by giving priority to reason, national reconciliation and peace. To do this he sent a Bill to the Mexican Congress that would guarantee certain rights for indigenous people, the passage of which would fulfill a cheap demand of the Zapatistas. The leader of the guerilla movement, known as sub-commander Marcos, immediately responded to the gesture by President Fox and said he would leave his jungle hideout sometime in the coming months to help promote passage of the Bill. The conflict in Chapas began with the Zapatistas uprising on January 1st 1994. About 130 people died in the first two weeks of that month before a cease-fire went into effect. Since then the Mexican army has kept the guerillas surrounded in a jungle area. An attempt by the government of President Ernesto Zideo to resolve the conflict through peace talks in 1996 failed because the Mexican Congress refused to implement some of the terms including a new law to protect indigenous Indian rights. But the so called Indigenous Rights Bill submitted by President Fox is likely to meet stiff opposition in the Congress as well because it includes several provisions that conflict with the Mexican Constitution. Newspaper columnist Serhil Sermientos says that in fact the proposal would take rights away from individual Indian people in Chapas and elsewhere and lead to further impoverishment of these communities. According to the new legislation Indians will only be allowed to own land collectively and to exploit the resources of that land collectively. This in my opinion violates the right to private property that many Indians would probably want and like. And in fact this is happening at a time when we have seen the experience of communist China and the Soviet Union in which the collectivization of land actually had a terrible result. One of the reasons why this country, which used to be an exporter of food, became a net importer of food over the past few decades is because we have about 60% of the land owned collectively. Mr. Sermientos says the Bill would also restrict the rights of women in Indian communities in violation of the Mexican Constitution and in contrast to the Fox government's own policy of promoting the role of women in society. Women are not allowed to participate in community assemblies, they are not allowed to participate in certain crucial decisions of communities. So by accepting this legislation we are setting a terrible precedent, legal precedent in Mexico. Although he disagrees with the Fox policies, Serhil Sermientos says there may be no other way of reopening peace talks with the Zapatistas in order to end a simmering conflict that on January 1st will have been going on for seven years. But I do understand in a way the need of President Fox to reach out to the Zapatistas so that some kind of a peace agreement may be achieved after seven years of formal war. You really have to have a pretty atrocious massacre if you really wanted to get rid of that movement by military means. At the same time you cannot continue to have that rebellion for years on end and for decades. Mr. Sermientos says it's possible that the Congress may accept the Indigenous Rights Bill in order to help the peace process and that conflicts between that law and the Constitution will be left to the Courts. But while this may bring the Zapatistas out of the mountains and end their rebellion, it's unlikely to have an effect on other types of violent conflict in Chapas. In addition to the Leftist Zapatistas there are several well armed Right Wing paramilitary groups who have been responsible for massacres. There are also social and religious conflicts within Indian communities. What's more, the Southern State is the scene of arms and drug smuggling across the border from Guatemala and the first point of entry for Central American immigrants heading North through Mexico to reach the United States. The presence of the army there has been a deterrent to the lawlessness and any reduction in military forces would be welcomed by the criminal element in the border area. President Fox has ordered the pullback of troops from forward positions in Chapas in order to lessen tensions with the Zapatistas and there could be further withdrawals as part of the peace process. So the problem that Vicente Fox once said could be solved in fifteen minutes, may in fact take many more years to solve. Greg Flakus, VOA News, Mexico City.

Turkey's parliament approved a prison amnesty Thursday that will nearly halve the country's prison population and help the government transfer inmates from large wards to small cells. Meanwhile, 158 radical leftist inmates surrendered as Turkish soldiers battled for a third day to regain control of two prisons. The fight for control of Turkey's unruly prisons began Tuesday, when troops stormed 20 penitentiaries. On Thursday, police helicopters hovered over Istanbul's Umraniye prison and Canakkale prison in western Turkey _ the two facilities where inmates were still holding out _ and soldiers with megaphones urged prisoners to surrender rather than fight. Soldiers shouted ``Life is beautiful'' and ``If you are not thinking of yourselves, think of your parents waiting in front of the prison,'' the daily Milliyet newspaper reported. Most of the prisoners responded by chanting revolutionary slogans. Later, the standoff ended at Canakkale: Private NTV television showed some of the inmates jump out of a hole that police smashed into a prison wall and crawl toward heavily armed security forces who had taken up positions in a ditch. Some 400 inmates remained barricaded in the Istanbul prison. At least 19 people _ 17 prisoners and two soldiers _ have died since Tuesday, when soldiers stormed the 20 penitentiaries to end a two-month hunger strike by prisoners protesting moves from Turkey's huge, packed prison wards to small cells. Human rights activists fear the toll could be higher. On the political front, meanwhile, lawmakers approved the contentious amnesty bill, which is strongly opposed by families of crime victims and has already been vetoed once by President Ahmet Necdet Sezer. The president cannot legally veto the bill again. As soon as he signs it, nearly half the nation's 72,000 inmates could go free. The amnesty applies to crimes committed before April 23, 1999 and reduces sentences by 10 years. Convicted murderers and thieves will benefit, but rapists, corrupt state officials, drug traffickers and those accused of crimes against the state, such as Kurdish guerrillas and leftist and Islamic militants, will not. Officials have said it is vital for Turkey to reduce its prison population as it tries to regain control of the wards, where up to 100 prisoners live together with little or no oversight. Prisoners from political groups often run the wards like indoctrination centers and decorate them with rebel flags. The inmates launched their hunger strikes to protest government plans to move them into prisons with one- or three-person cells, where they say they would be more vulnerable to abuse by authorities. Many have continued their hunger strikes despite having been pulled from their wards by troops and taken to hospitals. The government has already started to break up the wards by moving prisoners to individual cells. But at Canakkale and Umraniye, the inmates remained defiant. Before their surrender, inmates at Canakkale had eluded the soldiers by constantly moving around within the prison, NTV reported. The prisoners in both penitentiaries were said to be armed with guns, gas bombs and flame-throwers made of pipes attached to gas canisters. They vowed to burn themselves alive if attacked, and several of those who died Tuesday had set themselves on fire. Soldiers used bulldozers to break holes in the thick prison walls to reach the inmates. NTV said helicopters were constantly hovering over the prisons in an attempt to intimidate the prisoners and break their resolve. Turkey ``could finish the operation in an hour, but the security forces are being careful so that there is no loss of life,'' Justice Minister Hikmet Sami Turk said. The inmates are linked to the Revolutionary People's Liberation Army-Front, or DHKP-C. The group aims to topple the government and replace it with a Marxist one. It has claimed responsibility for the assassinations of generals, policemen and government officials and has targeted U.S. military and diplomatic missions.

Helicopters buzzed overhead and soldiers pressed defiant inmates to end their standoff in the last Turkish prison holding out against authorities, after more than 158 left-wing inmates in another prison surrendered Thursday. Meanwhile, parliament approved an amnesty bill that would nearly halve the country's prison population and help end overcrowding in penitentiaries. The surrender ended a standoff at Canakkale prison in western Turkey but some 400 inmates remain barricaded in Istanbul's Umraniye prison. Private NTV said three prisoners died in the standoff, but Interior Ministry officials could not confirm the report. Seventeen inmates and two soldiers have died in the fighting since soldiers stormed 20 prisons across the country on Tuesday. Many of the inmates burned themselves alive. Though fighting ended elsewhere, prisoners at the Canakkale and Umraniye facilities held out. Earlier, helicopters buzzed around the prisons trying to intimdate the inmates, and soldiers with megaphones urged prisoners to surrender rather than fight. Soldiers shouted ``Life is beautiful'' and ``If you are not thinking of yourselves, think of your parents waiting in front of the prison,'' the daily Milliyet newspaper reported. Most of the prisoners responded by chanting revolutionary slogans. Later at Canakkale, NTV television showed inmates, wearing white tops, jumping out of a hole that soldiers smashed into a wall. The inmates then crawled toward heavily armed security forces who had taken up positions in a ditch. At Umraniye prison, shots were heard throughout the night, the Anatolia news agency reported. Security forces were throwing tear gas from holes in the prison's roof and side walls to force some 400 prisoners out. Turkish security forces launched the assault on the prisons trying to impose control over the facilities' wards _ which inmates often ran as their own fiefdoms _ and to end a two-month hunger strike by prisoners protesting plans to break-up the wards. On the political front, meanwhile, lawmakers approved the contentious amnesty bill, which is strongly opposed by families of crime victims and has already been vetoed once by President Ahmet Necdet Sezer. He cannot veto the bill again, and as soon as he signs it, nearly half the nation's 72,000 inmates could go free.

Many have continued their hunger strikes despite having been pulled from their wards by troops and taken to hospitals. Although hundreds have demonstrated in the streets in support of the prisoners, the prison assault has been popular. The prisoners are mostly from fringe groups that have little support, and many Turks have been critical of their government for not reining in the prisoners earlier. ``It is ... a great shame that the state has allowed the current mess in the prisons to prevail for so long without taking effective steps,'' wrote Ilnur Cevik, editor-in-chief of the Turkish Daily News. Radikal newspaper quoted Interior Minister Sadettin Tantan as saying that the government had chosen to take the ``slow road'' and use psychological warfare to end the siege. Turkey ``could finish the operation in an hour, but the security forces are being careful so that there is no loss of life,'' Justice Minister Hikmet Sami Turk said.

Troops closing in on hundreds of armed inmates in an Istanbul prison were hampered by a snowstorm Friday as authorities increased the death toll from four days of prison riots to 22. The fight for control of Turkey's prisons began Tuesday, when troops stormed 20 penitentiaries. By Friday, only inmates at the Umraniye prison were still holding out: During the night, smoke billowed from Umraniye as left-wing inmates inside set fire to mattresses and blankets, resisting calls to surrender. As daylight came, soldiers in riot gear advanced further into the prison, where 423 inmates had barricaded themselves inside a conference hall, footage on private NTV television showed. The station said a snowstorm was slowing down the soldiers, and authorities said they were moving cautiously to avoid further casualties. ``We hope this meaningless action will be ended before it turns into madness,'' Justice Minister Hikmet Sami Turk said. On Thursday, troops tossed tear gas grenades through holes drilled in the roof in a move to end the siege. The inmates still refused to come out, vowing to fight until ``death or victory.'' At least 22 people _ 20 prisoners and two soldiers _ have died since Tuesday, when soldiers stormed the 20 penitentiaries to end a two-month hunger strike by prisoners protesting moves from Turkey's huge, packed prison wards to small cells. The inmates claim they would be vulnerable to abuse from authorities in the small cells, and most of those who died set themselves ablaze rather than surrender alive. At least five of the bodies bore gunshot wounds, an autopsy report revealed. After the raids, more than 600 inmates were immediately incarcerated in new prisons with small cells. The government has been insisting on ending the ward system, which lets up to 100 prisoners live together with little or no oversight. Prisoners from political groups often run the wards like indoctrination centers and decorate them with rebel flags. Soldiers found guns, computers and mobile phones in some recently captured prison wards. In one instance, rebels had torn down the walls of a ward so that male and female prisoners could live together. Officials have said it is vital for Turkey to reduce its prison population as it changes the system. On Thursday, President Ahmet Necdet Sezer approved an amnesty law that will set free some 35,000 inmates and help authorities divide the wards into one- or three-person cells like in the newly built prisons. The inmates covered by the amnesty are expected to be released within a month. The amnesty does not apply to prisoners who opposed the state, such as Islamic, Kurdish or leftist militants. Many of the leftist inmates are linked to the Revolutionary People's Liberation Army-Front, a group that aims to establish a Marxist republic in Turkey. The group has claimed responsibility for the assassinations of generals, policemen and government officials and has targeted U.S. military and diplomatic missions.

Thousands of hungry Afghans, driven from their homes by the region's worst drought in 30 years, are arriving at U.N. food camps in western Afghanistan, the United Nations said Friday. Over six days, 4,600 people arrived at one of six U.N. food camps in the western province of Herat, according to a U.N. statement issued in neighboring Pakistan. The five other camps are already full and their conditions are miserable because of poor response to a request for aid from the international community, the statement said. Thousands of other refugees are likely to pour in as Afghanistan's bitter winter progresses. ``The drought currently affecting Afghanistan has put at risk the lives of about 300,000 in the western region,'' the U.N. statement said. The warning comes just three days after the U.N. Security Council voted to impose sweeping new sanctions on Afghanistan's ruling Taliban militia. The sanctions are intended to press for the extradition of Saudi dissident Osama bin Laden and the closure of alleged terrorist camps in the country. Fearing a violent backlash, the United Nations evacuated all international workers. But while Afghans have expressed anger at the new sanctions, there has been no violence. It's not clear when the U.N. workers will be returning to Afghanistan. Erick de Mul, chief coordinator for humanitarian aid, said earlier he hoped they could return within days. The U.N. resolution calls for an arms embargo against the Taliban, bans international travel by Taliban officials, closes Taliban offices outside the country and further restricts international flights. While the sanctions were meant to target only the Taliban rulers and not the impoverished people of Afghanistan, both U.N. and non-U.N. humanitarian workers say the measures will isolate Afghanistan further _ and that they couldn't have come at a worse time. The World Food Program previously warned that as many as 1 million Afghans face the possibility of starvation this winter because of the drought, which has destroyed three-quarters of the country's crops and about half the livestock. In the beleaguered capital, Kabul, ordinary Afghans say the threat of sanctions has further weakened the currency, causing the price of basic foods to rise. Kabul's 1 million residents are largely dependent on international aid to survive. A Taliban ban on poppy production, the country's only cash crop, also has badly hurt ordinary farmers. Many of the Afghans trying to get to Pakistan say they have been forced off their farms because the Taliban won't let them grow poppies, from which opium is produced and heroin manufactured.

President-elect Bush nominated defeated Missouri Sen. John Ashcroft to be attorney general on Friday, choosing a conservative Republican who lost his re-election bid to a dead man. ``An effective attorney general must be a person of prudent character and executive ability,'' Bush said. He also said there must be a commitment to ``fair and firm and impartial administration of justice.'' ``I'm confident I found the correct person in John Ashcroft,'' he said. Ashcroft, 58, was a two-term governor of Missouri before he went to the Senate in 1994. Gov. Mel Carnahan challenged him for re-election in one of the feature Senate contests of 2000, but was killed in an airplane crash in October. His name remained on the ballot, and he won. His widow, Jean, was appointed to the Senate seat. Ashcroft said political defeat ``brings more than emotion and pain, it brings perspective.'' With the appointment, he said, it also brought a call to renewed and noble service. The senator, a favorite of Republican conservatives who had maneuvered against more moderate choices for the Justice Department, said he would ``strive to be a guardian of liberty and equal justice.'' Ashcroft, an ardent foe of abortion, said the rule of law ``knows no class, sees no color and bows to no creed,'' and that will be his guideline. ``You have my word that I will administer the Department of Justice with integrity, I will advise your administration with integrity and I will enforce the laws ... with integrity,'' he promised Bush. At a news conference after the announcement, Bush said of Ashcroft, ``This is a person who believes in civil rights for all citizens.'' In other developments: _Virginia Gov. James Gilmore is Bush's pick to head the Republican National Committee, according to GOP sources. _ The Rev. Floyd Flake, a former Democratic congressman and charter school proponent from New York, said Friday that he had withdrawn his name from consideration as education secretary. ``I made a decision that the issues that led me out of Congress in the first place _ family, church, my work with charter schools _ were still priorities,'' Flake said after relaying his feelings to the Bush camp. Dealing with White House criticism of his suggestions that there are warning signs of an economic slowdown, Bush said it is foolish for anyone to suggest that he is trying to talk down economic prospects. Bush said one way to encourage consumption and enhance consumer confidence ``would be to let the people have some of their own money back.'' ``There are clear warning signs, warning signs which will require action in the halls of Congress,'' Bush said in a push for his $1.3 trillion, 10-year tax cut proposal. He was asked about his apparent difficulty in finding a secretary of defense. ``I would characterize my search as deliberate,'' he said. Former Sen. Dan Coats, R-Ind., long considered a sure-bet to become the Pentagon chief, remains a leading candidate, but Bush has told advisers he needs more time to consider his options. Other candidates include Paul Wolfowitz and Richard Armitage, who both served under Vice President-elect Dick Cheney when he was defense secretary. Bush said he knows there is a lot of speculation but when he makes up his mind on Cabinet posts, he won't be acting on the basis of politics but on the basis of what is right for the country. Asked about a moratorium on the federal death penalty, Bush said he supported capital punishment ``when it is administered fairly.'' Bush, who oversaw a record 40 executions in Texas last year as governor and 152 over the course of six years, said he sees no reason for a moratorium on the death penalty at the federal level. ``If there is compelling evidence that the system is not swift and sure and just, I will listen'' on any death penalty case, Bush said. ``His views are the correct views,'' Ashcroft said. The president-elect also has selected New Jersey Gov. Christie Whitman to head the Environmental Protection Agency, according to several GOP officials. Bush was expected to make more announcements later Friday. He also was meeting with state agriculture industry leaders. Another GOP governor, Tommy Thompson of Wisconsin, hopes to follow Whitman into the Bush administration. Senior Republicans in Washington and Wisconsin said Thompson accepted Bush's offer in a Thursday morning telephone call to be Health and Human Services secretary. They said the announcement would be made next week. However, two senior Bush advisers said the president-elect had not quite closed the deal with Thompson. All the officials spoke on condition of anonymity. In his presidential campaign, Bush faced criticism from Democrats and some conservationists for his stewardship of the environment in Texas, where he had been governor since 1995 until his resignation Thursday. Environmentalists argued he didn't fight pollution aggressively enough; During his second term, Houston became the nation's smoggiest city. Indeed, the EPA itself intends to review clean-air plans the state was forced to submit earlier this month because of persistent smog. Bush contended the state's air improved on his watch, and said he was behind major air-quality improvement initiatives. Whitman, 54 and a Republican, championed open-space preservation in New Jersey and refused to abandon an unpopular auto emissions test designed to reduce air pollution. Critics said that to attract businesses, she compromised water pollution protections and cut spending for state offices that prosecute environmental abuses by industry. Sierra Club Executive Director Carl Pope said Whitman has a ``mixed record on the environment, but on balance we believe the Sierra Club could work with her.'' As head of an agency created by President Nixon 30 years ago, Whitman would have to decide whether to pursue Clinton administration environmental initiatives. For instance, the EPA currently is seeking substantial new pollution controls on coal-fired power plants in the Midwest that pollute the Northeast. She has supported the EPA position.

President Clinton was making decisions on Friday about granting clemency to some of the scores of convicted Americans seeking presidential pardons or lighter punishment. Among those seeking intervention are a Wall Street financier, an American Indian activist convicted of killing two FBI agents and a longtime Clinton friend and supporter convicted of trying to influence a former member of Clinton's cabinet. ``There are a number of different cases where there are mandatory minimums (sentences) that have been unduly harsh and there may be one or two cases like that today, particularly in cases where the person was involved in nonviolent drug conviction,'' White House press secretary Jake Siewert said Friday. He said the president was expected to make more clemency announcements before Jan. 20. Asked on Thursday whether convicted Israeli spy Jonathan Pollard was on the list, Siewert replied: ``I wouldn't expect anything new on that.'' The administration has been reviewing Israel's request that Pollard be released. The former civilian analyst for the U.S. Navy was convicted of espionage in 1985 for giving Israel tens of thousands of top-secret documents. He was sentenced to life in prison. Earlier this week, a coalition of 675 clergy asked Clinton to commute sentences of nonviolent drug offenders. In a letter, the group asked the president to grant clemency and release on supervised parole those federal prisoners who have served at least five years for low-level, nonviolent involvement in drug cases. ``To find some of those drug offenders who deserve to be released, Clinton should appeal to the more than 600 federal trial judges, asking each to name at least one defendant whom he or she was required by mandatory sentencing laws to sentence to a term he or she thought was unjust _ the kind of cases that the judges lost sleep over,'' said Chap Thevenot, coalition coordinator. Among others who have asked Clinton for clemency: _Leonard Peltier, convicted of killing FBI agents Ron Williams and Jack Koler who were searching for robbery suspects on the Pine Ridge Indian reservation in South Dakota in June 1975. He was convicted and sentenced in 1977. The defense contended that evidence against him was falsified. _Susan McDougal, a former real estate business partner of the Clintons who was sentenced in 1996 and released from prison in 1998. She was convicted of four felonies related to a fraudulent $300,000 federally backed loan that she and her husband, failed savings and loan owner James McDougal, never repaid. About $30,000 of the loan was used as a down payment on property briefly placed in the name of Whitewater Development, the Arkansas real estate venture of the Clintons and McDougals. _Michael Milken, who made billions for himself and others in the 1980s junk bond business, was convicted of securities fraud, served 22 months of a 10-year sentence and paid over $1 billion in fines, restitution and legal settlements. Milken's pardon request is backed by one of Clinton's original benefactors, California supermarket mogul Ron Burkle. _Archie Schaffer III, a Tyson Foods executive convicted under a 1907 law of trying to influence agricultural policy by arranging for then-Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy to attend a Tyson birthday party in Arkansas in 1993.

President Elect George W Bush has nominated outgoing Missouri Senator, John Ashcroft to be Attorney General. At a news conference Friday morning in Austin Texas, Mr. Bush said Mr. Ashcroft would strive to be a guardian of liberty and equal justice. He's a man who'll uphold the law. He stands on principle and he will not politicize the Attorney General's office. Mr. Ashcroft was defeated in his US Senate re-election bid last month by the late Governor Mel Carnahand, whose widow Jean was appointed to his seat. In other appointments Mr. Bush named New Jersey Governor Christie Whitman as his choice to head the Environmental Protection Agency. Ms. Whitman said she is eager to take the new job. For the past seven years I have what I believe to have been the best job in America, Governor of New Jersey. I also believe that my job has given me the best preparation for this new opportunity, an opportunity that I embrace with great enthusiasm and great expectation. Mr. Bush also selected Virginia Governor, James Gilmore to be the Chairman of the Republican National Committee.

Mexico's Popocatepetl volcano was mostly quiet on Friday, although scientists warned that the lack of activity could just be the volcano preparing for another major eruption. The mountain began spewing a fiery mixture of rock and ash late Monday in its strongest eruption in 1,200 years. It has since settled into quiet sleep, sending up two large plumes of ash Thursday night, followed by a series of tremors early Friday. Scientists have warned that energy is still building inside the 17,886-foot mountain in a possible precursor to more activity. Saying another strong eruption is likely in the next day, they have urged the 40,000 people who live within eight miles of the mountain to stay away. Although the volcano has returned to the occasional puffs of smoke it has been sending up for the past six years, residents were still fearful after this week's spectacular display of red-hot rock and ash. Most were staying put in shelters, and planned to remain through Christmas. Before Monday's eruption, many residents had ignored pleas to evacuate, fearing looters would steal their belongings. Soldiers sent in to guard houses during the last evacuation in December 1994 often ended up robbing them. The last evacuation also seemed frivolous to many because the volcano, which had just become active again after a nearly 70-year slumber, produced little activity.

Turkish soldiers lobbed tear gas grenades into a besieged prison Friday, forcing 430 inmates to surrender and ending a four-day crackdown on prisons that left at least 24 prisoners and two soldiers dead. Inmates in Istanbul's Umraniye prison were the last to hold out after some 5,000 soldiers stormed 20 prisons on Tuesday. The crackdown aimed to impose control on prison wards where left-wing inmates were holding a hunger strike to protest a move to smaller, less secure cells. They began surrendering after Turkish soldiers smashed holes into the roof with sledge hammers and lobbed tear gas grenades inside. The gas was so thick that 19 ambulances had to evacuate soldiers and inmates suffering from gas inhalation. Also Friday, Turkey began freeing hundreds of prisoners under an amnesty law aimed at reducing prison overcrowding and helping security forces regain control of the prisons. Overcrowding is so severe, inmates live in wards with up to 100 people and sometimes have to share beds. The government has said that leftist, Kurdish and Islamist prisoners run their wards like indoctrination centers and objected to the move because it would reduce their power. Prisoners who oppose the state will not be among the 35,000 prisoners freed under the amnesty law. Authorities have rushed hundreds of hunger-striking inmates from the prisons to hospitals, but most of them have refused treatment. The Health Ministry ordered doctors Friday to treat inmates by force if necessary. Inmates at 18 prisons were overwhelmed by soldiers or surrendered on the first day of the siege. Another 158 inmates at Canakkale prison in western Turkey gave up Thursday. On Tuesday, soldiers stormed wards controlled by Marxist militants at Istanbul's Bayrampasa prison, entering for the first time in almost a decade. The Marxist Revolutionary People's Liberation Army Front, which has claimed responsibility for the assassinations of generals, policemen and government officials, wants to create a Marxist state in Turkey. A look inside the Bayrampasa prison showed living quarters covered with black soot, and littered with charred mattresses, broken furniture, medicines, makeshift gas masks and a homemade satellite dish. In a garden outside the ward, a cage held 30 pigeons that the inmates were raising. Though the cage was partly smashed open, the pigeons did not fly away. Raising pigeons is a popular hobby in Turkey. ``The prisons, which the state has not been able to enter for years, have been turned into the terrorist groups' training camps,'' the pro-Islamic Milli Gazete wrote. ``So who is responsible for this disgrace?'' Although the prison siege has been popular _ the militants have little support in society _ several commentators have questioned why the death toll in the raid was so high. ``This is a total massacre,'' wrote Sevim Belli in the pro-Kurdish Yeni Gundem. ``If their intention was to kill, they should have waited. Those on a hunger strike would have died anyway.

President Clinton granted pardons Friday to 62 people, including Dan Rostenkowski, the former chairman of the powerful House Ways and Means Committee felled by a corruption scandal. The White House announced that Clinton also issued a pardon to Archie Schaffer III, an Arkansas chicken company executive ensnared in the corruption investigation of former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy. And he commuted the sentences of three others, including two women entangled in drug cases who got lengthy prison terms because of mandatory sentencing laws, the White House said. Rostenkowski, an Illinois Democrat, pleaded guilty in federal court to two counts of mail fraud and was sentenced to 17 months in prison and $100,000 in fines back in 1996. It was the final act of a legal and political drama that began two years earlier when prosecutors probed the misuse of taxpayer funds. Prosecutors said Rostenkowski, long among the most powerful figures in Washington, used public funds to pay employees who did little or no work, and to buy personal gifts. Rostenkowski's pardon was a surprise _ his name was not among those floating about town in recent weeks as Clinton's presidency draws to an end. The pardons are among the acts of presidential clemency that Clinton is weighing over the holidays. Others under consideration include former Wall Street financier Michael Milken and Whitewater figure Susan McDougal. Schaffer, the chief spokesman for the Arkansas-based poultry producer, was convicted by a jury under a 1907 law of trying to influence agricultural policy by arranging for Espy to attend a Tyson birthday party in Arkansas in 1993. ``I feel great. This is wonderful news,'' Schaffer said in a telephone interview with The Associated Press from his lawyer's office in Fayetteville, Ark. ``I would have preferred to have been vindicated by the judicial system. We were prepared to continue battling that, but we're pleased with this outcome as well.'' Both Republicans and Democrats in his home state had urged Clinton to pardon Schaffer, arguing the spokesman was convicted under an obscure law by an independent counsel seeking to build a case against Espy. Espy was eventually acquitted. Even the federal judge who oversaw the case said he believed Schaffer was innocent and twice tried to acquit him, only to be reversed by an appeals court. U.S. District Judge James Robertson reluctantly sentenced Schaffer to a year and one day in prison and a $5,000 fine, the minimum that he said was allowed under the Meat Inspection Act. The extra prison day would have made Schaffer eligible for good-behavior credits that could free him nearly two months early, the judge said. Besides the pardon pleas, Schaffer supporters wrote nearly 100 letters to Robertson asking that he show leniency. Schaffer, the nephew of former Arkansas governor and U.S. Sen. Dale Bumpers, D-Ark., served in Bumpers' administrations and led a business group studying educational reforms during Clinton's tenure as governor. Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee and Sen. Tim Hutchinson, both Republicans, were among those who pleaded with Clinton to pardon Schaffer. ``I think Archie is deserving and that he's gone through a lot,'' Hutchison said. ``I'm pleased with the president's decision. He's gone through trial after trial and appeals.'' The sentencing was one of the final items in Independent Counsel Donald Smaltz's six-year, $23 million investigation of Espy. Jurors acquitted Espy in December 1998. The officials said the two others Clinton planned to pardon are: _Kemba Smith, 28, of Richmond, Va., who had been sentenced to 24 years and six months in prison with no chance of parole for helping her boyfriend Peter Hall, head of a violent drug ring. _Dorothy Gaines, 42, of Mobile, Ala., who similarly received 19 years, seven months for her low-level role in a local drug ring. The men who actually ran it received more lenient sentences. Both women were subjects of a national campaign by women's groups and opponents of mandatory minimum prison sentences.

Well, as the year ends, we look back at year 2000 and a number of issues taken up by US lawmakers. Action on many matters was stalled in Congress during the 2000 session because of some deep partisan differences. But despite that gridlock there was movement on a few Foreign Policy matters including debt relief for developing nations and the relaxation of the trade embargo on Cuba. VOA's David Swan reports on the US Congress for VOA News. Earlier in the year, the Clinton administration's attempt to ease the developing world's debt burden appeared to be a lost cause. But a few months later lawmakers gave the White House what it wanted, 435 million dollars to forgive at least some of the crushing loans owed by the poorest countries. The turnabout came because of pressure from an unusual coalition ranging from the Pope to rock singer Bonal and including both Republicans and Democrats on Capitol Hill. The bi-partisan group outvoted critics who argued the plan is too expensive. Republican Congressman Spencer Balkus put the issue in stark terms. A world that lives in poverty, hunger and disease. A world, which last night 40,000 people died of starvation and preventable disease, last night as we slept. Mr. Balkus and other supporters argued successfully that the measure will cost Americans little while making a great impact abroad. In another key vote, Congress approved 1.3 billion dollars to help Colombia fight the drug cartels, though some fear that US troops will be pulled into that conflict. Republican Senator Ted Stevens had a heated exchange with General Charles Whilom, the Pentagon commander in the Latin American region. Who's going to go in if this blows up? Got 800 people on the ground, tell me this is not a Vietnam again. Sorry this is not a Vietnam again. I spent '65, '66, '69 and '70 in Vietnam and I think I'll know it when I see it happening again. When I go to Colombia I do not feel a quagmire sucking at my boots. The move to allow food and medicine shipments to Cuba was also controversial, though it marks only a limited break in the 38 year economic blockade of the island. The measure also permits sales to Iran, Libya, Sudan and North Korea. While there was little strong objection to the proposed limited dealings with those governments, Cuban American House members and Conservative Republicans did fight to block anything that might help Fidel Castro. This left the final legislation a good deal weaker than its backers wanted. It bars US banks from financing the sales, meaning Havana must either pay cash or obtain credits from Third countries. The President, who eventually signed the Bill, attacked this provision. It looks like it eases the embargo on food and medicine, but it probably doesn't very much because it doesn't provide any financing credits which we give to other poor countries, whereas it definitely restricts the ability of the Executive branch to increase people to people contacts between Americans and Cubans. One issue seems likely to come up again in the new year. In a victory for supporters of legalized abortion, Congress lifted restrictions on aid to overseas family planning groups that provide abortion services or campaign for abortion rights. But abortion opponents say the move is only a temporary setback. No family planning funds can be given out until February after a new President takes office. If that President is Republican George W Bush, he may bring back the restrictions. This decision and the fight over food for Cuba show that some old battle lines remain clearly drawn in Congress, but the vote to provide debt relief is a sign these division are not absolute. David Swan, VOA News, Capitol Hill.

President Vojislav Kostunica's followers promised sweeping reforms as the first official results suggested pro-democracy forces captured an overwhelming majority of seats in the Serbian parliament, a main locus of power in Yugoslavia. Initial results announced shortly before noon on Sunday indicated Kostunica's camp secured 177 seats in the 250-member legislature _ more than the two-thirds majority needed to change the constitution. The party led by former president Slobodan Milosevic was a distant second, with 38 seats. The results were based on more than 30 percent of ballots cast, the state election commission said. In addition to Milosevic's Socialist Party, two other parties made it into the assembly: the ultranationalist Radical Party, with 22 seats, and the hard-line Serbian Unity Party, with 13. Further results were expected later Sunday, but no major shifts were expected. Milosevic's once-dominant Socialist Party had already conceded defeat, and Kostunica's Democratic Opposition of Serbia began celebrating victory after the polls closed Saturday night. ``The democratic reconstruction of Serbia and Yugoslavia will be completed after these elections,'' Kostunica said on Serbian state television. ``In a few days, we'll have a new parliament and government which will be able to tackle corruption and other problems ahead.'' Saturday's results in Serbia's elections will enable the democratic movement to complete the revolution set in motion when Kostunica defeated Milosevic for the Yugoslav presidency Sept. 24. Milosevic refused to accept the result and called for a runoff, triggering riots Oct. 5 that forced him to concede defeat. The pro-democracy forces also indicated they would head for a showdown with leaders of Milosevic's discredited government. Despite the change in Yugoslav leadership, Milosevic's allies had still controlled key power levers in Serbia, such as the judiciary and the 60,000 strong police force. Serbia accounts for more than 90 percent of Yugoslavia's population of 10 million. ``We won the elections, but a huge job is ahead of us,'' said prime minister designate Zoran Djindjic. ``The government will work 24 hours a day for the people.'' Without a strong party to back him in the new parliament, Milosevic is now vulnerable to prosecution for running the country during his 13 years in power. Kostunica has refused to extradite Milosevic to the U.N. war crimes tribunal in The Hague, Netherlands, but wants to try him and others in Yugoslavia. ``The elections show that people want a decisive showdown with the former regime,'' said pro-democracy leader Zarko Korac. ``The Democratic Opposition of Serbia needs courage to do it.'' The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, whose 350 observers monitored the balloting, approved the vote. ``Fundamental freedoms were respected and election law was implemented transparently, impartially,'' said mission head Adrain Severin. The Socialists took some comfort in the fact that they will be the largest single party in the new parliament, since the Kostunica coalition includes 18 parties and is expected to breakup next year. The biggest loser was the neo-communist Yugoslav Left Party of Milosevic's wife, Mirjana Markovic, which looked likely to end up with less than 1 percent of the vote. Another loser was the Serbian Renewal Movement led by Vuk Draskovic, for years the undisputed leader of the anti-Milosevic camp. The initial results showed Draskovic's party, which refused to join the Kostunica coalition, fell short of the 5 percent mark needed to win seats in parliament. The biggest surprise was the performance of the Serbian Unity Party, created by indicted war crimes suspect Zeljko Raznatovic, or Arkan, who was assassinated in Belgrade in January. The party appears to have profited from Serbia's struggle against ethnic Albanian militants over a piece of territory in southern Serbia that borders Kosovo. The Serbs lost control of Kosovo last year after NATO's 78-day bombing campaign to stop Milosevic's crackdown against ethnic Albanians. ``We will do everything to protect Serbia, to free Serbia, to protect our country from further disintegration,'' party leader Borislav Pelevic said. Turnout was estimated at 60 percent. Many ethnic Albanians in Kosovo and in parts of southern Serbia bordering the province boycotted the vote, which they called invalid, and hundreds protested the election Saturday in Kosovo's capital, Pristina. A great majority of them want independence. Kosovo was the only region where the Socialist Party defeated pro-democrats. According to initial results in Kosovska Mitrovica, where most of Kosovo's remaining Serbs live, the Milosevic's party won 52 percent of the vote. Kostunica's coalition won 29 percent.

KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ U.N. international employees began returning to Afghanistan on Sunday after the ruling Taliban militia guaranteed they would not face a violent backlash because of newly proposed sanctions. Three U.N. workers arrived in the beleaguered Afghan capital, Kabul, early Sunday, while seven others returned to Herat and Kandahar, said Erick de Mul, the U.N. coordinator for Afghanistan. They are among about 50 international workers the United Nations pulled out of Afghanistan last week amid fears of a violent reaction to a sanctions resolution the U.N. Security Council passed last week. ``Everything is fine and we don't have any problems in our operations,'' de Mul said. De Mul said the Taliban had guaranteed the safety of the U.N. employees, most of whom work for agencies involved in removing land mines, aiding refugees and providing food assistance. Most of them will be back in Afghanistan in the coming week, he said. ``I am very happy to back here and resume work,'' David Pakas, a U.N. security official, told reporters after arriving at the Kabul airport. The United Nations gave the Taliban a month to surrender suspected terrorist Osama bin Laden and close terrorist training camps or face new sanctions proposed by the United States and Russia. The Security Council said the sanctions would hit only the Taliban, not ordinary Afghans already devastated by a protracted civil war and a persistent drought. However, ordinary Afghans already are suffering: the currency has plunged and prices have gone up because of the sanction threats. Thousands of people are trying to flee the country. The sanctions call for an arms embargo on the Taliban, including foreign military assistance purportedly given by Pakistan, and for all Taliban offices overseas to be closed. The sanctions will go into effect in a month if the Taliban fail to close Afghan ``terrorist'' camps and deliver bin Laden to the United States or a third country for trial in the 1998 bombing of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. Taliban leaders have refused to hand over bin Laden. They also have denied allegations that the camps are used to train Chechen rebels, who are fighting for independence from Russia. In November 1999, the United Nations imposed limited sanctions on the Taliban to force bin Laden's extradition. The Taliban, who rule more than 95 percent of Afghanistan, including Kabul, are fighting the northern-based opposition alliance in an attempt to extend their control over the entire country. The Taliban practice a fundamentalist brand of Islam; they are mostly Sunni Muslims and Pashtun, Afghanistan's majority ethnic group. The opposition is made up of predominantly ethnic and religious minorities.

A graduate student raps with a hammer and chisel at a dinosaur bone encased in yellow rock, out of rhythm with the Carole King song playing in John Horner's paleontology laboratory at the Museum of the Rockies. Horner and his wife, Celeste, are in his crowded office off to the side of the laboratory, after returning from digs in eastern Montana, where research teams had spent a third summer studying ecosystem evolution at the end of dinosaurs' reign, and where they have found five tyrannosaurus skeletons. They will return next summer to excavate the skeletons. The bones were discovered in the broken, spare landscape of Garfield County, once a seabed and later covered by forests of sequoias, where tyrannosaurs roamed 65 million to 67 million years ago. Before the discovery, only 16 other tyrannosaur skeletons had been discovered since Barnum Brown of the American Museum of Natural History in New York uncovered the first one, also in Garfield County, in 1902. Under an agreement with the federal government, Horner and his Hell Creek Project research team have been hunting fossils on the 1.1-million-acre Charles M. Russell National Wildlife Refuge. The project has two more years to collect fossils and other clues of evolution in the era of the tyrannosaurus, including climate variations across 3 million years, which could be useful as a comparison with recent climate changes. The findings may also shed light on why dinosaurs disappeared 65 million years ago. Horner, the author of five books on dinosaurs, became known for his research showing how some dinosaurs cared for their young. He was a consultant for the Jurassic Park movies. His attention is now focused on tyrannosaurs, and he will be studying the skeletons as they come out of the ground next summer. The discovery includes several early specimens that may be useful in trying to prove his theory that the dinosaur was more scavenger than hunter. If the arms of the early specimens are longer than those of later ones, it will suggest that the appendages were vestigial, or evolving away, he said. Many predators, like cats, rely on their arms to hold prey, but arms are less essential to scavengers, he said. Horner has described tyrannosaurs feeding like vultures and hyenas do in Africa. ``All you have to do,'' he said, ``is be big and ugly and mean-looking and stinky to run stuff off.'' Horner's finds are ``obviously very significant,'' said Philip Currie, an expert on carnivorous dinosaurs and a curator at one of the world's largest dinosaur museums, the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology in Drumheller, Alberta. ``A T. rex is a rare enough dinosaur that any new find is exciting and newsworthy.'' One of the new specimens appears to be the biggest ever, Horner said. It is named Celeste after Horner's wife, who first spotted its well-preserved pelvis jutting from a bank. While the new specimens await excavation, Horner said extrapolations of initial measurements suggest that the Celeste skeleton is 10 percent bigger than that of Sue, the nearly complete, tyrannosaurus skeleton found in South Dakota in August 1990. Sue was sold in 1997 for nearly $8.4 million to the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago. How much of Celeste remains is unknown, Horner said. But, he said, the pelvis, nine articulated vertebrae and a handful of ribs are exposed, suggesting that at least 30 percent of the skeleton is there. Celeste may be given to the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, he said, though the future of the other skeletons has not been decided. One may end up near where it was found: at the tiny Garfield County Museum, where a weathered sign outside the town of Jordan states, ``T. Rex Capital of the World.'' The Museum of the Rockies will probably get another, Horner said. Although the dinosaurs are federal property, Horner is the arbiter of their future, according to his agreement with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the federal Bureau of Land Management.

Bombs exploded outside churches in Jakarta and five other Indonesian cities and towns on Christmas Eve, killing at least 14 people, injuring dozens and worsening the already difficult relations between Muslims and Christians throughout the fractured archipelago. The blasts, including one outside Jakarta's main Roman Catholic church near the presidential palace and the main mosque, happened as prayer services were about to get under way Sunday night. The explosions set cars ablaze and damaged some churches. President Abdurrahman Wahid on Monday asked Christians not to be provoked and blamed the attacks on forces intent on ``destabilizing the government.'' In the past Wahid has accused supporters of ex-dictator Suharto of using violence to create political uncertainty. ``There is an effort to use the name of Islam to destroy Christians or to use the name of Christianity to destroy Muslims,'' Wahid said, vowing to press forward with democratic reforms. About 20 bombs exploded outside churches in Jakarta and five other Indonesian cities and towns, killing at least 14 people and injuring 47, said National Police Chief Gen. Bimantoro, who like many Indonesians uses only one name. There were no immediate claims of responsibility, but religious violence and tensions have been rising throughout this predominantly Muslim country. Although most of the violence has taken place in the Moluccan islands, Muslim vigilante groups have recently attacked restaurants and nightclubs in Jakarta, the capital. Wahid, himself a Muslim scholar, has advocated religious tolerance, but Sunday's attacks add to a long list of crises and acts of violence that have worsened during his 14-month rule. Five Catholic and Protestant churches were targeted in Jakarta, where three people were killed, including a man who died in an explosion at a bus stop outside a church and adjacent Christian school, police said. The Jakarta bombs exploded within an hour and a radius of about a mile. The bomb that exploded near the Roman Catholic Cathedral, thought to have been planted in a parked car, left worshippers shaken. ``I was in the cathedral with my wife and two children. I heard the explosion. I am very worried that there will be religious fighting everywhere,'' said Winarno, who also goes by only one name. An unexploded bomb was also discovered near the cathedral, where hundreds of Christians were arriving ahead of midnight Mass as thousands of Muslims were leaving the nearby mosque at the end of Islamic evening prayers. Other churches were evacuated after receiving threats. ``This is clearly the work of people who are determined to make trouble and to bring about clashes among people,'' Jakarta police spokesman Superintendent Anton Bahrulalam said. ``We will be on full alert when people come to pray on Christmas Day.'' There were four explosions outside one church in the exclusive Jakarta suburb of Menteng, police said. Four of the dead Sunday were police officers who tried to disarm a bomb in Pekanbaru on Sumatra island, the official Antara news agency said. One civilian was also killed there. Antara reported blasts outside of churches in Medan on Sumatra island. Police there later found nine unexploded bombs. Two people were killed in a blast at a Christian-owned house in Bandung west Java, Indonesia's main island, police said. Bimantoro on Monday did not give details on the other four deaths. On Batam island, not far from neighboring Singapore, three blasts injured 22 people, it said. Explosions rocked three churches in the town of Mojokerto in the east Java. Bombs also went off near three churches in Mataram on the tourist island of Lombok. The Christmas celebrations coincide with the final days of Ramadan, Islam's month of fasting, which ends Tuesday. Sunday's attacks follow a rise in Muslim extremism throughout the country. The heaviest violence has been in the Moluccan or Maluku islands in Indonesia's east, where an estimated 5,000 people of both faiths have been killed over the past two years. Christians make up less than 10 percent of Indonesia's 210 million people. Many are from the ethnic Chinese minority, which has been targeted by Muslim groups during past civil unrest. Sunday's bombings were the latest in a series to rock the capital. The worst this year came in September, when a car bomb and subsequent fire killed 15 people in a basement parking lot at Jakarta's Stock Exchange. In August, two people were killed when a car bomb blew up outside the Philippine ambassador's home. Authorities made arrests after those attacks and several smaller explosions, but have filed no formal charges. Most of the suspects have been released.

A leftist inmate who set herself on fire during last week's prison raids died from severe burns at a hospital Monday, bringing the death toll from four days of clashes to 29, the Anatolia news agency reported. Berrin Bickilar, 22, a convicted militant of the Revolutionary People's Liberation Party-Front (DHKP-C), poured cologne on her body and set herself ablaze during a raid last week at Usak prison in western Turkey. So far, 17 prisoners have died from severe burns, apparently after setting themselves on fire rather than surrender. Ten others were killed by their comrades or by soldiers. Two soldiers were also killed. Troops stormed 20 prisons across Turkey on Tuesday to stop a hunger strike staged by left-wing inmates to protest plans to move them from large wards to small cells. The inmates surrendered Friday after four days of rioting and fighting. Some 1,000 prisoners, including members of a separate leftist group, have been moved from the wards to cells in new prisons. Some 98 of those prisoners are continuing with their hungry strikes, while about 2,000 others nationwide have started a new hunger strike to support the leftists. Inmates charge that prison authorities would abuse them if they were transferred to small cells, while the government says the communal wards were run by gangs and militant groups. Authorities said they found several firearms and weapons, as well as maps detailing routes and offices used by government officials, in the prisons. Most of the inmates were linked to DHKP-C, a small fringe Marxist group, which has claimed several killings and bombings in the past in Turkey.

From Bethlehem to the camps of NATO troops in Bosnia, Christians in some of the most violence-shattered corners of the world celebrated this year's Christmas with prayers for future peace. Celebrations turned to tragedy in central China, where a fire tore through a building in Luoyang city Monday night, killing up to 309 people, according to official media. Among the dead were revelers at a Christmas party trapped by the blaze in a disco on the top floor. Elsewhere, the year's 2000th commemoration of Christ's birth was marred by a wave of church bombings on Christmas Eve in Indonesia and gloom in the Holy Land caused by Israeli-Palestinian violence. In Indonesia, many Christian worshippers stayed home from services Monday after the blasts at churches in nine cities killed 15 people and injured nearly 100. The government, meanwhile, was trying to prevent the bombings from sparking further religious violence in the world's most populous Muslim nation. Thousands of security forces went on alert ahead of celebrations by Muslims starting Tuesday night to mark the end of the holy month of Ramadan. Pope John Paul II said he was dismayed by the attacks. ``Our brothers and sisters in faith, even on this Christmas Day, are undergoing a tragic time of trial and suffering,'' he said. In his traditional Christmas Day message ``Urbi et Orbi'' (Latin for ``to the city and to the world''), the 80-year-old pope lamented the ``endless streams'' of refugees from conflicts around the world and lamented fighting in the Middle East, where ``violence continues to stain with blood the difficult path to peace.'' In Kosovo, Serbian authorities said four Serbs were kidnapped over the weekend on their way to family Christmas celebrations in the town of Gnjilane. They were freed on Monday, the official Tanjug news agency said, but it gave no further details. Hopes for a bustling tourist trade this Christmas in Bethlehem, the birthplace of Jesus, were dashed as only thin crowds of pilgrims trickled into the West Bank town. Across Israel and its occupied territories, at least 345 people have been killed in three months of Israeli-Palestinian fighting, most of them Palestinians. In Iraq, President Saddam Hussein called on Christians and Muslims around the world to wage holy war against Israel. But there were glimmers of reconciliation amid the holiday's strife. In Istanbul, the leaders of 13 Orthodox Christian churches gathered at the city's Byzantine cathedral to observe Christmas together for the first time in their history. Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I said the church was striving for ``peaceful resolution among peoples, nations and various churches.'' In Mexico, evacuees from towns around the Popocatepetl volcano celebrated despite being away from their homes: They played with pinatas and ate turkey dinners in shelters where they have been living since the peak outside Mexico City had its biggest eruption in over a millennium last week. The world's political leaders used the holiday to urge peace. Queen Elizabeth II urged an audience to follow Jesus' simple but powerful teaching to ``treat others as you would like them to treat you.'' Belgium's King Albert II warned his country against racism and xenophobia and spoke of his recent visit to Belgian peacekeeping troops in the Balkans, saying he was ``horrified by the ravages caused in our times and on our continent by extreme nationalism and xenophobia.'' At the center of NATO efforts to maintain the peace in the Balkans, U.S. troops in northern Bosnia decorated their barracks with Christmas trees and colored lights. Soldiers from Spain, Italy, France, and Portugal held a dinner, attended Mass and sang songs in Mostar, southern Bosnia.

Russian ground controllers lost contact for nearly 20 hours with the Mir space station before re-establishing communication Tuesday, allaying fears the accident-prone,140-ton vessel might have spun dangerously out of control. It was the latest mishap for the nearly 15-year-old space station, which the Russian government reluctantly had decided to bring down in a controlled descent in late February. Mission Control's last contact with the Mir had been at 6:40 p.m. (10:40 a.m. EST) Monday, said Valery Lyndin, a spokesman for Mission Control. Several successive attempts to restore the link later Monday failed, but on Tuesday afternoon, ground controllers managed to briefly link up with the Mir. A second attempt later Tuesday was a complete success, said Vera Medvedkova, another Mission control spokesman. Controllers were able to maintain full contact for 17 minutes, the complete planned time of the radio linkup, she said. ``It's not clear yet what has caused the malfunction,'' Lyndin said. He said that the information received during the first hookup showed that the station had not lost pressure _ calming initial fears that the loss of communications signaled that the station was spinning out of control and could crash to Earth. But he did not give any other details. Normally, such communications problems are sparked by computer glitches. The loss of radio contact could signal a problem with the on-board computer. Observers have been worried about the Mir's safety for a long time. However, after a terrifying fire and near-disastrous collision with an unmanned cargo ship in 1997 followed by a series of computer glitches and breakdowns, the Mir had been running relatively smoothly this year. The Mir had only one, 73-day manned mission this year. The cosmonauts returned safely in June, raising official optimism about the prospects of keeping it in orbit even without a crew. But Russian space officials said it was necessary to dump the Mir because experts could no longer guarantee the safety of its operation. ``We cannot continue this game ... which I call Russian roulette,'' Russian Aerospace Agency chief Yuri Koptev said in November as he tried to explain the decision to discard the Mir. Many considered the decision a blow to Russian pride. Calling for careful preparation for the Mir's descent, space officials recalled a Soviet satellite that crashed into northern Canada in 1978, in a major embarrassment for the Soviet leadership. Nobody was hurt but radioactive fragments were scattered over the wilderness. The unoccupied U.S. Skylab space station fell to Earth in 1979 when its orbit deteriorated faster than anticipated, spreading debris over western Australia. No one was hurt. In 1991, fragments of the Soviet Salyut-7 space station, the Mir's predecessor, fell on the Andes Mountains region of Argentina near the Chilean border, inflicting no damage or injuries but generating fears worldwide. Space officials lost control of the Salyut-7 after trying to extend its lifetime. When Mir was launched on Feb. 20, 1986, it was the epitome of the Soviet technological edge, and it has far surpassed the three to five years it was expected to last. But critics said it had also outlived its usefulness and long pointed to the potential dangers of keeping the aging station aloft. Mission Control usually contacts the space station several times a day. If ground controllers failed to re-establish regular contact with the Mir, its solar panels would eventually lose alignment with the sun, and the power shortage would freeze its systems. The station would also rotate chaotically, making it hard for any emergency crew to dock and try to regain control. The Russian Cabinet's plan is to crash the Mir into the Pacific 900 to 1,200 miles east of Australia on Feb. 27-28. The decision followed failed attempts to find private investors to keep the station operative. Officials have said Russia should concentrate its funds on the new international space station instead of the Mir _ something the U.S. space agency NASA has been urging for years. NASA is leading the 16-nation international project, which has suffered repeated delays because of funding problems for Russian modules. The government had planned to dump the Mir this spring because of funding problems but extended its time aloft after the Netherlands-based MirCorp signed a lease agreement on the station and promised to pay for its operation. While MirCorp financed a mission to the Mir earlier this year, it failed to meet other commitments, forcing the government to divert funds that had been allocated to the new international station to maintain the Mir, officials said. Energiya has a 60-percent stake in MirCorp and the remainder belongs to private investors. Mission Control on Tuesday was also monitoring the docking of an unmanned Progress cargo ship with the International Space Station. The docking took place shortly after 6 a.m. EST and was a success.

Seven escaped convicts may have carried out a threat they made when they broke out of prison nearly two weeks ago, police said. ``You haven't heard the last of us yet,'' read a note the men left when fleeing the Connally Unit in Kenedy on Dec. 13, said John McAuliffe, inspector general of the Texas Department of Criminal Justice. Now, the men are suspected in the shooting death of Officer Aubry Hawkins, 29, who attempted to break up a Christmas Eve robbery at an Oshman's sporting goods. ``It certainly will be a Christmas to remember and for all the wrong reasons,'' said Jimmy Perdue, Irving's assistant police chief. Investigators filed capital murder warrants against the seven convicts, who remained at large Tuesday. Two dozen employees herded to the back of the store during the holdup helped identify the suspects, said Chief Lowell Cannaday. A makeshift memorial had taken shape at the sports store, which was closed in honor of the fallen officer. Hawkins' weapon had not been found. Police spokesman David Tull said he didn't know if the robbers took any weapons or ammunition from the store. During the prison break, the convicts took 14 .357-caliber Magnum pistols with 238 rounds of ammunition, a loaded automatic rifle and a loaded shotgun. It is unusual that the suspects have remained together since their escape, said Larry Fitzgerald, spokesman for the Texas Department of Criminal Justice. ``These are desperate and dangerous people,'' Fitzgerald said. The prison, 65 miles southeast of San Antonio and more than 300 from Irving, has a capacity of 2,834 male prisoners. It opened in July 1995 and has 550 security personnel. The escape was the prison's fourth inmate uprising this year. In April, eight prisoners assaulted three officers, inflicting minor injuries, and in June an inmate severely beat a corrections officer. Also in June, another officer suffered minor injuries when she was stabbed six times by an inmate carrying a sharpened metal rod. ___ On the Net: Irving Police Department: http://www.irvingpd.com/ Texas Criminal Department of Criminal Justice: http://www.tdcj.state.tx.us/

Russian scientists are experiencing more problems with the aging Mir Space Station. They lost contact with it twice in the past day, raising fears it might spin out of control and crash to Earth. Rob Parsons reports. After hours of anxiety Russia's mission control has re-established radio contact with Mir. Ground controllers picked up the station as it completed an orbit of Earth. But for 24 hours Mir had been out of touch, raising concerns that the 115-ton station might spiral out of control and crash to Earth. Radio contact is essential to controlling the station's position. The fear was that its solar panels would lose alignment with the sun, thereby depriving Mir of energy. Robert Parsons, BBC News, Moscow. This is the BBC News.

This is The World, a co-production of the BBC World Service, PRI and WBGH in Boston. I am Tony Kahn. In the past 24 hours Russian space scientists have lost contact twice with Mir. While communications have now been reestablished, the continued problems with the aging space station do not bode well for its future. Not that it has much of a future anyway. Moscow plans to bring the 14-year-old Mir back to earth in two months. James Oberg spent 22 years at NASA's mission control. What do you think went wrong? What went wrong was that the people running Mir yesterday and this morning were the second shift people that made all the main controllers, who are specialists over there, were working on this re-docking this morning of a supply ship to the international space station. At the re-docking there was... there was quite a bit of anxiety on because there was a crash with Mir three years ago at the re-docking that led to the loss of a module, almost the loss of a whole station. So that all the senior people were for the last 24 hours were working on this other operation. They weren't even in the control center with the Mir control room. Now some, either some switch was set wrong or some indicator was overlooked by the... we wouldn't call them the bottom of the barrel, but we will call them the second or third team and it took a while to get the station back and they now do have communication. The second loss of communications was routine because as Mir circles the earth it comes up over the horizon for a few minutes and then sets and that's what happened. And that was a misunderstanding by the part of a journalist in Moscow, who after all pays about two minutes a day attention to space. Well, tell us if you can since you do have very much the inside view on this, what may have gone wrong and how loss of communication with the Mir could conceivably lead to its plunging toward the earth far in advance of anybody's plans and in a direction that maybe nobody could control. That could happen and if it does it will be a good show. It's not going to hurt anybody. What could have happened if the radio communication were currently cut off and if there was no way to steer it as its orbit slowly slipped closer to the atmosphere, it could fall to earth somewhere between 50 degrees north and south and scatter debris across a thousand mile area, a thousand mile stretch. But even though Mir is one of the biggest objects in space, man-made object, satellites have been falling to earth for almost 50 years. It didn't hurt anybody. But none so big as the Mir. Well, the Mir wouldn't come in as a big... as a single piece. It will be torn apart by the reentry forces and by atmospheric heating, and the pieces that do survive for a satellite are pretty well known now that the hard, really hard metal pieces tend to burn or just disintegrate in the atmosphere. The spherical fuel tanks for example cool off pretty well and flow down. We had one fuel tank , a US airforce rocket land in front of a farm here in Texas about five years ago and just one 'thud' into the lawn. It was going like the speed of a parachute just actually because it was slowed by the atmosphere. So I think we are looking here at a hype. Now in terms of Mir itself, we are also looking at a case where it's simple to categorize it and put a label on it as the "trouble plague" or the "decaying station" and it ran through a lot of trouble back in 96 and 97. But the things that caused that trouble back then have been fixed and technically, although it's older in design, most airplanes flying around are older than they ever intended to fly. Mir would not be a technical problem to keep flying. It is a financial problem because now with the new international space station, Russia has got to send ships up to that. And it can't build enough supply ships for both stations, that's the key. I know that attempts have been made to keep the Mir going by coming up with some sort of moneymaking scheme here on earth. And in fact you are a paid consultant to one of them. Mark Brunette Productions was planning a kind of survival like theme series for NBC. That's right, we have a program we are going to call "Destination Mir" and that will continue although it maybe a different destination. Well, tell us what the plan was. The plan in that case was to develop a recruitment of would-be space travelers from the American public and go through a selection process, take about a dozen or more, and send them to Russia where they will be eliminated week-by-week in a training program. The final survivors of the training program would then get to fly aboard a Russian Soyuz spacecraft into space. The aim was to fly to Mir, fly that mission to Mir, but there are other missions going into space that could be... just as equally be commercially available. So that's likely to happen. It's still pressing forward even though they may have changed the name of the program. James Oberg spent 22 years at NASA's mission control. Mr. Oberg, thankyou very much for speaking with us and for your perspective on this. We really appreciate it. Fine, Tony.

Ousted Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori pledged in an article Wednesday to mount a political comeback, but said he would not return soon to his homeland because of ``political persecution.'' Fujimori, who has been in self-imposed exile in Japan since November, was declared unfit for office by Peru's Congress after he resigned amid corruption scandals involving his former spy chief. Fujimori did not say whether his political future would include an attempted return to the presidency. But he vowed to remain in the arena. ``I am now determined to start anew and undertake a political program to make Peru a truly just and great country,'' Fujimori wrote in the article published Wednesday on the front page of the Yomiuri newspaper, the first of four installments. Fujimori, who ruled Peru for 10 years with an authoritarian hand, said he would embark on his new political program ``if and when the innumerable accusations now leveled against me are proved groundless.'' But he said ``political persecution'' by the new government made it unsafe for him to return to Lima for now. ``This is simply a revival of the Inquisition that occurred during the Middle Ages,'' Fujimori wrote, accusing his successor, interim President Valentin Paniagua, of mounting a campaign of persecution under the guise of fighting corruption. Earlier this month, the government in Tokyo announced that the 62-year-old Fujimori _ the son of Japanese immigrants _ held Japanese citizenship and therefore could stay indefinitely in the country. Tokyo's decision set off an outrage across Peru, where authorities are investigating Fujimori's connections with his one-time spymaster and top adviser, Vladimiro Montesinos. Montesinos, a fugitive rumored to be hiding out in Venezuela, is wanted on charges of money-laundering and influence-peddling. Fujimori, who has denied any wrongdoing, could also face charges if he returns to Peru. Fujimori said he chose exile in Japan to avoid potential violence between his supporters and enemies that could have broken out if he had returned. He said he also feared he could become a victim of that violence. ``Furthermore, I could not neglect the safety of my own life,'' he wrote.

Celebrations marking the end of Islam's fasting month went ahead amid tight security Wednesday despite fears that Indonesia's Christians would seek revenge for a series of deadly church bombings. Thousands of police and soldiers were deployed in Jakarta and other cities, and security forces stood guard at mosques and churches in the world's most populous Muslim nation. Officials here had worried that mosques might be targeted in revenge attacks, but no religious violence was reported on Wednesday, the first day of the two-day Muslim religious holiday Eid al-Fitr. Three days earlier, on Christmas Eve, explosions at Christian churches in nine Indonesian cities killed 15 people. It was one of the most coordinated terrorist attacks to hit Indonesia, which has been troubled by years of civil unrest. President Abdurrahman Wahid said he feared provocateurs were trying to spark violence between the Muslim majority and Christian minority as a way of destabilizing his government. Muslims make up about 90 percent of Indonesia's 210 million people, and the attacks came just before the holiday that marks the end of Ramadan, the Muslim fasting month. In the wake of the bombings, church leaders called on Christians not to seek revenge against Muslims during the holiday. Media reports said a church in Kudus, a district 120 miles southeast of Jakarta, was slightly damaged in an arson attack on Tuesday, but no other attacks were reported against either side. On Tuesday night, as Ramadan ended, hundreds of thousands of people ignored official calls to stay at home and instead poured into the streets to celebrate. Many banged drums and set off firecrackers after evening prayers. The next morning, Jakarta's streets were quiet. Guards searched bags and used metal detectors to check thousands of worshippers who entered the city's main Istiqual mosque. Security was also tight at the nearby state palace, where Wahid meet thousands of wellwishers. No one has taken responsibility for Sunday's blasts. Police have arrested four suspects and detained dozens of others for questioning. ``We have not come to a conclusion about which group is responsible or the motive,'' National Police Chief Gen. Suroyo Bimantoro said. Elsewhere Wednesday, media reports said rebels in Indonesia's restive Irian Jaya province had captured two members of the federal security forces. The state Antara news agency said some 20 guerrillas belonging to the Free Papua Movement mounted a raid on Tor Atas district, near the provincial capital, Jayapura. They apprehended two police sergeants guarding the local church, the agency said. A police spokesman in Jayapura said the security forces were searching for the missing men. Irian Jaya, some 2,500 miles west of Jakarta, is a former Dutch colony. Insurgents there have been battling for independence since Indonesia occupied the province in 1963. Calls to secede have grown in the region in recent months, and a series of rebel flag-raising protests and clashes with security forces have left dozens dead.

In Russia, for example, many of the long-term reforms that Clinton talked about so passionately were never executed. In retrospect, Russia proved unwilling to phase out its role as arms merchant to rogue states, an unspoken quid pro quo for economic aid. ``We probably underestimated the basic difficulty of the institutional transformation of Russia,'' one senior official said. ``Was Russia in worse shape than we recognized in '96? Probably.'' But Rubin says: ``Whatever money we spent, it was worth it for a world in which we are not now in a nuclear standoff.'' Similarly the much-talked-about effort to build a ``global financial architecture'' has faded. There have been some changes _ countries now must reveal more financial information to investors, and the monetary fund has changed many of its lending practices _ but even the president has stopped talking about redesigning the world's financial system. Eventually the backlash from the crisis came full circle, colliding with Clinton's free-market dreams. The Asian crisis confirmed what many developing nations had suspected: Globalization was a rich country's game, and the rules were rigged to favor the most competitive. So when the United States proposed a further opening of world markets, developing nations struck back, starting in Seattle in late November 1999. In an interview a few weeks ago, Clinton said: ``A lot of the people in these developing countries who were marching are mad at America because we, almost alone among the advanced countries, would like to have a global trading system that has minimum labor and environmental standards. And so a lot of them thought that's my indirect way of being a protectionist, in protecting the good jobs in America and keeping them poor.'' It was not the case, Clinton said. But he lost the argument, and the talks collapsed. The China accord, however, could eventually redefine America's relationship with Beijing. If Clinton is right, it could result in the erosion of the Communist Party's control. Elsewhere in the world, Clinton has adjusted his pitch. In the past year, he has talked far more about the fate of the poor. ``His Africa trips had a big impact,'' said James Steinberg, a deputy national security adviser until last summer. ``He saw with his own eyes that even when governments wanted to do the right thing, their huge debt and AIDS and other impediments, made it hard to get off the ground.'' But if there was a single moment at the end of Clinton's presidency that crystallized the successes and the limitations of his effort to use global capitalism to drag nations toward democracy, it came in Hanoi, on a Saturday afternoon last month. To the rising alarm of Vietnam's leaders, Clinton's trip was drawing huge crowds, among them former Vietcong guerrillas, who toted along their grandchildren to see the leader of the nation with which Vietnam once fought. ``He will bring the Internet,'' one aging veteran said, and then confessed that he had never sat in front of a computer. It was just what Clinton wanted to hear _ until he met Le Kha Phieu, the Communist Party's general-secretary, who had stopped many of the reforms Vietnam started in the early 1990s, warning that globalization was a fancy word for surrender. ``We have seen the collapse of the USSR,'' he told Clinton, and yet ``we are still on our feet, we have reaffirmed socialism.'' They spent the next hour politely arguing whether America had imperialist designs on Vietnam in the 1960s and, by implication, whether it had them now. The Vietnamese leader's message was clear: Just because we trade with you, don't expect us to embrace democracy. An hour later, Clinton got a much more mixed message from the mayor of Ho Chi Minh City, who asked about low-income housing and job creation. Which side will prevail? ``I don't think there's any way for us to bring openness and freedom to China or Vietnam more quickly than the one we've adopted,'' Clinton said later in an interview. But he added: ``I don't think freedom is inevitable, or the triumph of democracy is inevitable. But I think it is rendered far more likely by the power of our example and the strength of our engagement.''

This is The World. I am Tony Kahn. Just ahead, fine music from Israel. But first we have the answer to today's Geo Quiz. We were looking for Peru's second largest city and the answer is Edikipa, the unofficial capital of the Southern Peruvian highlands. Those remote highlands were rumored to be the place where Peru's disgraced spy chief Vladimir Montesinos fled to last October. Montesinos was President Alberto Fujimori's right hand man until he was caught on videotape bribing an opposition Congressman. The ensuing scandal led to the fall of both Fujimori and Montesinos. Where Vladimir Montesinos is now of course would be a terrific Geo Quiz. The problem is only one person would be able to answer it and he is not talking. Montesinos' whereabouts are the subject of international speculation and the subject of this report from The World's Quill Lawrence. Vladimir Montesinos has never liked the spotlight. In fact until just a few years ago, not a single photograph of Peru's spy chief had ever been published. He must be regretting even those photos now as he tries to elude the arrest warrant out for him in Peru. Montesinos originally fled to Panama, a favorite place for Latin American dictators of yore to claim asylum. After staying a month with his personal secretary and mistress, he returned to Peru in October and disappeared. From there on it's all rumors. Ecuadorian papers report that he was spotted sailing on his yacht, 'The Charisma,' to the Galapagos Islands and that among his crew was a young Peruvian masseuse. Montesinos is alleged to have disguised himself either by losing weight and growing a beard or by dressing up as a woman, but presumably not both. His stay at the Blue Whale Hotel in the Galapagos is rumored to have lasted a week. Costa Rica's press picked it up from there. Montesinos is said to have entered the Central American nation via the Cocos Islands on a Venezuelan passport with yet a different woman at his side before flying off to the Caribbean Resort Island of Aruba. Venezuelan authorities have been busy denying that Montesinos then arrived in Caracas under the alias of Manuel Alexander Rodriguez Perez and underwent plastic surgery to change his appearance. They even went so far as to produce a Venezuelan named Manuel Alexander Rodriguez Perez and parade him before the media. Of course there are other rumors that Montesinos never left Peru in the first place or that he's already dead. Still you can be sure that new sightings of Montesinos will be reported from all over Latin America in the New Year. For The World, I'm Quill Lawrence.

More than 150 police officers died in the line of duty in 2000, an increase of 11 percent from the year before, police organizations said Thursday. The National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund and the Concerns of Police Survivors said 151 police officers have been killed so far in 2000, up from 134 in 1999, the lowest level since 1965. The annual average in the 1990s was 153, compared to 187 during the 1980s and 222 during the 1970s. The most recent officer killed was Aubrey Hawkins, 29, of Irving, Texas, shot while investigating a Christmas Eve holdup at a sporting goods store. Seven convicts who escaped a Texas prison are wanted in the shooting. Texas had the most police officers killed in 2000 with 14 dead, followed by California with 11 and Georgia and Tennessee with 10 each. The number of officers shot to death rose from 45 last year to 51 so far this year. Except for 1999, when there were more deaths from automobile accidents than shootings, firearms have been the leading cause of death for law enforcement officers every year since 1792, Craig W. Floyd, chairman of the memorial fund, said in an interview. However, the widespread use of bulletproof vests has greatly reduced the number of shooting deaths during the last 25 years, he said. This year 47 officers died in automobile accidents, a number that has remained relatively stable over the last four years. ``Officers are finding themselves in dangerous situations driving at high rates of speed and maybe don't have the level of training to navigate the roadway safely under those circumstances,'' Floyd said. ``They're paying the price with their lives.'' Noting that 20 officers died after being struck by cars while outside their cruisers, Floyd said drivers need to be more cautious when they see police stopped by the side of a road. Accidental deaths have been on the rise, Floyd said. ``When you're a law enforcement officer any situation can be potentially life threatening,'' he said. Lt. James R. Haddock, of Kissimmee, Fla., died after the horse he was riding fell and crushed him as he acted as an escort for a trail ride. Lt. John Galvin, of Wichita, Kan., died of burns after 1,500 pounds of old fireworks he was helping to dispose of exploded. Also in 2000, eight officers died in motorcycle accidents, seven were killed in aircraft accidents, six died from job-related illness, three drowned, three died in falls, two were stabbed, one was beaten to death and one died after falling from a bicycle during a training exercise. ___ On the Net: National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund: http://www.nleomf.com Concerns of Police Survivors: http://www.nationalcops.org

Ghana's vice president conceded defeat to a veteran opposition leader early Saturday in a runoff election to choose a successor to longtime President Jerry Rawlings. With most votes counted, John Atta Mills said in a statement that it was clear that vetern politician John Agyekum Kuffuor had won Thursday's vote. ``I would like on behalf of the (ruling party) and its millions of supporters to congratulate Mr. Kuffuor for his electoral victory,'' he said. ``As an outgoing government, we pledge to make his transition into office as smooth as possible.'' Kuffuor thanked Mills for his ``graciousness'' and pledged to cooperate with his National Democratic Congress. With votes counted in 194 of 200 districts, Kuffuor had 57 percent support, compared to 43 percent for Mills, Rawlings' chosen successor. Rawlings, a charismatic former fighter pilot, has dominated politics in this West African country for two decades. He won multiparty elections in 1992 and 1996, but is barred by the constitution, which he approved, from running for another four-year term. Scattered clashes and accusations of intimidation marred Thursday's vote. Opposition observers said they had been harassed by government supporters, who prevented them from monitoring voting at some polling stations in the capital, Accra, the nearby port city of Tema and the eastern Volta Region. In other parts of Ghana, however, balloting went smoothly with 57.7 percent of the country's nearly 11 million registered voters casting ballots, election officials said. U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan commended the leaders and voters in his native Ghana for ``the transparent and peaceful manner in which the elections were conducted.'' ``With these elections, Ghana has demonstrated that democracy and its institutions continue to take root in Africa,'' he said, according to a statement read by deputy U.N. spokesman Manoel de Almeida e Silva. The runoff became necessary after neither candidate received the 50 percent required for an outright win in the first round of voting on Dec. 7. Kuffuor, a British-trained lawyer and veteran politician, won 48.4 percent of the vote. Mills won 44.8 percent. Five other candidates who together took only a small percentage of the first-round vote endorsed Kuffuor in the second round. The elections mark the end of an era for Ghana, where Rawlings steps down Jan. 7 after his second term. He won multiparty elections in 1992 and 1996, but is barred by the constitution, which he approved, from running for another four-year term. Rawlings, a charismatic former fighter pilot, has dominated politics in Ghana for two decades. Originally a brutal military dictator, he embraced democratic and free-market ideals in the 1990s, becoming a darling of Western donors. But his overwhelming popularity has dimmed in recent years, as the country's once-thriving economy declined. Prices for Ghana's chief exports, cocoa and gold, plummeted as oil prices rose. Rawlings' departure marks a rare commitment to democratic change in a region characterized by repressive leaders and flawed elections.

Hemmed in by 2,000-foot rock massifs, this village seems, by measure of its beauty and mystery, altogether more like a place to stay in than to leave. Yet Al-Ribat's villagers, driven by poverty, have migrated for centuries _ in recent decades, mostly northward, out of Yemen and across the vast desert known as the Empty Quarter that forms a barrier between here and Saudi Arabia. Historically, few places anywhere in the Arabian Peninsula have been less exposed to outside influences, except for the experiences _ rarely liberalizing _ of those who have migrated to Saudi Arabia and returned. Al-Ribat, in consequence, remains an archetype of the deeply conservative, devoutly Islamic and, toward outsiders, insistently wary community that typifies much that is unchanging in remoter parts of the Arab world. One migrant, in 1931, was a baggage carrier bound for Jiddah, the Saudi Arabian port city that is a gateway to Mecca, Islam's holiest place. His name was Muhammad bin Laden. In time, he and his brothers founded a construction company, now known as the Bin Laden Group, which prospered by building roads and palaces under the patronage of the Saudi royal family, and made the bin Ladens a fortune estimated at billions of dollars. But what has drawn attention to Al-Ribat is not Muhammad bin Laden, who died in the 1960s, so much as Osama, the 17th of his 51 children. Osama bin Laden, in recent years, has been the United States' most wanted terrorism suspect, with a $5 million reward on his head for his alleged role in the August 1998 truck bombings of two U.S. embassies in East Africa that killed more than 200 people, as well as a string of other terrorist attacks. In the indictment drawn up by the FBI against 15 men accused in the embassy bombings, bin Laden is listed first, as leader of ``an international terrorist group,'' Al Qaeda, that has been largely financed out of bin Laden's inheritance from his father, estimated at about $300 million. Most recently, the FBI has named bin Laden as a prime suspect in the suicide bombing of the U.S. destroyer Cole, which was attacked in Aden harbor, 350 miles by road southwest of here, on Oct. 12, with the loss of 17 sailors' lives. In Al-Ribat, there are no direct connections, at least none that are known, to the attacks mounted by bin Laden, who has taken sanctuary since 1996 in Afghanistan. He was born in Jiddah, to a Syrian mother, in 1957, and educated through university level, in civil engineering, in Saudi Arabia. But bin Laden has frequently cited his Yemeni ties, speaking often of his hope of leaving Afghanistan and seeking sanctuary somewhere in the ``high mountains and deserts'' of Yemen, where, he has said, he could breathe ``fresh air.'' This, and the restraints that Saudi Arabia has placed on any reporters attempting to delve into Osama bin Laden's roots, has made Al-Ribat an obvious destination for anybody seeking to learn more about one of the FBI's most wanted men. But with at least three hours of driving to the closest strip of paved road, the village is as remote as any in Yemen, and it guards its privacy with care _ much like Yemeni authorities who, since the Cole bombing, have insistently discouraged efforts to probe the domestic links of all suspects in the attack. In October, a reporter trying to reach Al-Ribat was halted 50 miles north of the village by agents of Yemen's secret police. Later, they ordered villagers elsewhere in this part of Hadhramaut province, in eastern Yemen, not to discuss bin Laden or the bombing. But by December, with official surveillance of reporters easing, a visit to Al-Ribat became possible. When Britain was the ruling colonial power in this region of the Arabian Peninsula, up to 1967, this part of Hadhramaut was a remote hinterland, reachable only by donkey or camel. The village lies at the extreme southern end of Wadi Doan, a dried-up river valley bordered by rocky mountains that narrows and deepens until it reaches a cul-de-sac at Al-Ribat. Along dusty alleyways that run between mud-brick homes, villagers willing to speak of bin Laden refer affectionately to ``Osama,'' smiling proudly. Ali Ahmed Bagader, a bright-eyed, keen-witted 8-year-old studying at the Bin Laden Madrassah, or Islamic school, met visitors as they pulled up in the dusty square near the village's main mosque. Along with Salim Saeed al-Gerin, a 26-year-old baggage carrier, Ali offered a guided tour of the village's bin Laden sites. ``A lot of Yemenis love him,'' he said during a pause at the madrassah, which operates in a wing of a home belonging to Abdullah bin Laden, Osama's uncle and one of the three brothers who founded the construction company. Holding a boxed copy of the Koran, Ali said villagers had come to know Osama bin Laden mainly through television, piped into the village via satellite dishes. ``We love him because he's a mujahid,'' he said, using the Arabic term for a holy warrior. ``We know that he fights for his faith, and for his country, that he has God's protection, and that he lives in Afghanistan.'' The only remaining member of the bin Laden family living in the village is Khaled al-Omeri, a 30-year-old second cousin of Osama, who runs a small grocery store, having failed to secure a niche in Saudi Arabia as an automobile mechanic. He, his wife and five children share a three-room apartment in a large, ramshackle home that belongs to Abdullah bin Laden, his grandfather. The home, with rotting wooden shutters and rain-stained walls, is known among villagers as the bin Laden house, and the dirt track that runs past it, on the edge of the dried-up riverbed running through the village, is called Bin Laden Street. Nearby is a one-room office for the Bin Laden Group, overseeing a project to bring piped water into Al-Ribat; the project is the bin Laden family's gift to their ancestral home. But like many villagers, Al-Omeri judged it wiser to keep his views of Osama bin Laden to himself. ``This is my jihad,'' he said, motioning to his small son, as he sat on the steps outside his store. As for bin Laden, Al-Omeri smiled. ``On that matter, I'd just as soon keep my peace,'' he said. Al-Ribat, with a population of about 7,000, is dotted with mosques and it still lives mainly from porterage _ the trade of Osama bin Laden's father when he left here by donkey 70 years ago. But for nearly 3,000 years, Hadhramaut has been renowned for its extraordinary agglomerations of 10- and 12-story mud-brick buildings, clustered together for defensive purposes behind high mud walls. Al-Ribat, typical of such villages, has traditionally combined its porterage business with a specialization in construction, which probably explains the transition that Muhammed bin Laden made, once established in Saudi Arabia, from porterage to building. When Gerin, the porter who helped with the visitors' tour, was asked what made the village the center of construction in Wadi Doan, he offered an incredulous response that said much about the persistence of all things in this remote hinterland. ``Why are we builders?'' Gerin said, leaning on a cane. ``Well, that's the way it is, and always has been, and always will be, until Judgment Day.'' Along with this steadfastness come heavy doses of faith. Some of this was echoed in the pamphlets stuck to Al-Ribat's walls by an Islamic summer school, with question-and-answer strictures that reflected a deeply conservative attitude. One of these, on Bin Laden Street, posed the question ``Is it all right to shake hands with a foreign woman?'' and offered the answer ``It is forbidden to shake hands with any women you can marry'' _ meaning any woman outside a man's own home. But at least one of the village's Muslim clerics, who doubles as headmaster of the madrassah in the bin Laden house, was willing to speak out against intolerant forms of Islam, including bin Laden's. ``What do I think of Osama's `holy war against Crusaders and Jews?''' he said. ``Well, I'll tell you: I am against it, because it harms Yemen's reputation more than it harms America. What I say is, if Osama wants to harm Americans, let him do it in America, not here in Yemen. From my point of view, Osama is a Saudi Arabian, not a Yemeni, and he and his beliefs do not belong here.''

New charges of robbery have been filed against two of the seven convicts who escaped together earlier this month from a Texas prison, and officials have posted a $100,000 reward for their capture. Since their Dec. 13 escape, when the seven fugitives loaded up with an arsenal of prison guards' weapons, they are suspected of robbing a store near Houston and killing a police officer during a robbery near Dallas on Christmas Eve. Five of the fugitives were believed to have been spotted Thursday at a fast-food restaurant near Dallas, but most of the leads received on the men's whereabouts have gone nowhere, law enforcement officials said. ``We hope the high reward money will entice those people who have been assisting them in traveling and hiding,'' prison spokesman Larry Todd said Saturday. ``We believe these are the same people who helped them make good on the escape.'' The ringleader is believed to be George Rivas, an armed robber who prosecutors have called ``one of the most dangerous men in Texas.'' On Friday, aggravated robbery charges were filed against Rivas and Donald Keith Newbury, 38, in connection with the Dec. 15 robbery of a Radio Shack in Pearland, a Houston suburb. Victims said the men tied up store employees and customers and then looted the store and the victims' pockets. The Pearland robbery was similar to the Christmas Eve heist in Irving, where two dozen employees were tied up in the back of an Oshman's sporting goods store. Irving Police Officer Aubrey Hawkins was killed when he approached the robbers behind the store. He was buried Thursday. The Irving police department is offering the $100,000 reward for information leading to the arrest and indictment of those responsible for the officer's slaying. Rivas, 30, was involved in more than a dozen robberies in Texas, New Mexico and Arizona during 1987-94. He was finally caught after a three-hour standoff in El Paso and was sentenced to 99 years for aggravated kidnapping and burglary. Texas authorities won't discuss any leads they are pursuing or what security measures they are taking for the fugitives' victims and prosecutors. Some relatives are clearly frightened. A couple who years ago adopted one member of the group, 23-year-old Randy Halprin, have fled the state with their two preteen children, afraid that he might try to return to their home in Dalworthington Gardens. Halprin was serving 30 years for injury to a child. Relatives of another of the fugitives, Patrick Henry Murphy Jr., went on television in Dallas on Thursday night, pleading for him to surrender. Murphy was serving 50 years for aggravated sexual assault with a deadly weapon and burglary in Dallas. ``Patrick, wherever you are, just please stop this violence and turn yourself in,'' said a tearful Kristina Rogers, Murphy's younger half-sister. ``You know you weren't raised to do this. Just stop the pain that the family is going through.'' The other escapees are Michael Rodriguez, 38, serving a life sentence for capital murder in San Antonio; Larry Harper, 37, serving 50 years for aggravated sexual assault in El Paso; Donald Newbury, 38, serving 99 years for aggravated robbery; and Joseph Garcia, 29, serving 50 years for murder in San Antonio. The subsequent manhunt has frustrated law officers from the several federal, state and local agencies involved. ``We've had spottings all over the state,'' Todd said. ``The leads did not prove fruitful.'' Employees at a fast-food restaurant in the Dallas suburb of The Colony said five of the fugitives were there on Thursday and left in a dark sports utility vehicle, said police dispatcher Gloria Carver. All seven fugitives were serving sentences ranging from 30 years to life and worked together in the maintenance department at the Connally Unit in Kenedy, a maximum-security state prison 60 miles southeast of San Antonio. They allegedly made their escape by posing as prison workers, tying up prison employees, stealing their clothes and escaping with 14 pistols, a loaded shotgun, a loaded rifle and 238 rounds of ammunition. They also left a note warning: ``You haven't heard the last of us.''

The United Nations is close to completing the deployment of around 4,200 peacekeepers and support staff to monitor a cease-fire between Ethiopia and Eritrea, an official said Wednesday. The troops from 22 countries have been arriving on an almost daily basis in the Horn of Africa nations. So far, 2,245 peacekeepers, 146 military observers and 1,535 support staff are present, most in Eritrea, said Angela Walker, spokeswoman for the U.N. Mission in Ethiopia and Eritrea. There are also 603 military support staff in the two countries from the Netherlands, Canada and Denmark, who are not being financed by the United Nations, but will support the mission, Walker said. The troops are being deployed to monitor the cease-fire between Eritrea and Ethiopia after the end of their two-year war and the demarcation of their disputed 620-mile border. The peacekeeping force is also supposed to oversee the redeployment of Ethiopian troops from Eritrean territory. The peacekeepers will be deployed in a 15-mile buffer zone in the area of the disputed border, most of it inside Eritrea. Walker said all the peacekeepers and support staff would be in the region within the next few weeks. The fighting ended in June when the nations signed a cessation of hostilities agreement and agreed to the deployment of a U.N. force. The conflict, which began in May 1998 was formally ended Dec. 12 when they signed a comprehensive peace agreement. However, Eritrea and Ethiopia have yet to agree on the dimensions of the buffer zone, which is delaying the redeployment of Ethiopian troops who advanced into Eritrea in a final military offensive in May, said Yemane Kidane, the chief of staff in the Ethiopian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. On Thursday, military officers from both sides held talks in the Kenyan capital, Nairobi, but failed to agree on the area the buffer zone should include. Thery are to meet again in Nairobi on Jan. 23. ``We are pleased that the negotiations are continuing and both sides seem to be cooperating,'' Walker said. ``We anticipate that it will continue to move forward and the continued confidence building measures will take root so that the peace will be maintained.'' The conflict cost the two impoverished nations, both plagued by drought, tens of thousands of lives and millions of dollars.

now, for the capital in washington. this was day one for the new 107th congress. there are many firsts in the new group of lawmakers -- not the least of whom, a first lady who happens to be a senator. for that, we're joined tonight by nbc's lisa myers. lisa? brian, this day, historic on many counts -- the most women ever in both the house and senate, the most evenly divided congress in history. some predict the new dynamic will force republicans and democrats to finally work together. others see still more gridlock. the star of the day -- the new junior senator from new york. congratulations, i'm so proud of you. also in the spotlight, missouri's jean carnahan. her husband, former governor mel carnahan, became the only dead man ever elected to the senate after being killed in a plane crash. today, she takes his seat. i have just gone through a very bittersweet moment in the senate chamber. another first, a senate evenly divided -- 50 republicans, 50 democrats, the tie broken by the vice president. that means, as long as al gore is vice president, democrats are in charge. the majority leader, senator daschle, is recognized. once dick cheney is inaugurated on january 20th, republicans are back in control -- barely. in the house, republicans also have a razor-thin margin, and today, reach out to democrats. it's only in washington where many still have a lingering animosity for the political parties. my friends, we need to get over it. how will all this division affect the nation's problems? the practical impact of this 50/50 is, it's more deadlock, more gridlock on the hill, more difficulty in getting solutions through the institution on big issues. both parties see a good chance of compromise on education reform and an hmo patients' bill of rights, and almost no chance of a deal on highly charged issues like privatization of social security. as for tax cuts, today the house's top democrat signals new flexibility. we realize that because of the enlarged forecast of the surplus and the slowdown in the economy, that we have got to look at revising perhaps the kinds of amounts that we were looking at before. now, privately, key players say families can pretty much count on a cut in estate taxes and a tax cut for married couples, maybe even a modest across-the-board reduction in tax rates, but nothing close to the trillion-dollar tax cut bush wants. brian? lisa myers inside capitol for us tonight, thanks.

tonight, a political career tragically interrupted and a wife who picks up the torch. it's been less than three months since the terrible accident that killed missouri's governor mel carnahan. now, his widow jean, who never had her own heart set on a career in politics, suddenly finds herself in his place -- in the u.s. senate. nbc's lisa myers sat down today with senator jean carnahan for her first extended interview since her emotional swearing-in. for missouri's new senator, jean carnahan, the last two days have been a journey of a thousand emotions, as she lives out her husband's dream. there were tears that i forced back at one point, after i signed the book. that officially made me a member of the senate. i thought a lot about him. and i felt very much like he was there. carnahan lost her husband of 45 years, mel, and their son, randy, in a plane crash in october. missouri voters elected her husband anyway, after she said she'd accept an appointment to his seat. for her swearing-in -- flanked by two children -- she wore a small torch symbolizing a favorite saying by her husband. he used to say that when he walked out of the house. he'd turn to us and say to the kids, "now don't let the fire go out." so far, carnahan, is surprising senate insiders with her poise, savvy and knowledge of issues. she might be one of the newest, but we think she's going to be one of the best! she is direct and unpretentious already frustrated by the chronic tardiness of senators, which, she says, shows a lack of regard for the time of others. carnahan promises to seek a sensible center. her first big test -- the controversial nomination of the man her dead husband defeated -- former senator john ashcroft -- to be attorney general. going in, you're totally neutral on the ashcroft nomination? i want to hear what he has to say on questions that i have, and questions others have expressed that women and minorities have expressed. let's give him his day. for her, she says each day is just about keeping going and hoping for the best. in all the grief, is there any joy or sense of accomplishment? i felt that yesterday. i felt like i was doing what i should do. i'm sort of shifting gears, in a way. and, yet, i know that mel's memory will always be there. my son's memory will always be there. shifting gears in that a 67-year-old woman who says her only previous office was a dining room table now believes she just might be able to do this job and do it well. lisa myers, nbc news, the capitol.

we're going to begin with the texas seven. there is no question that with seven violent convicts still on the loose and the texas authorities very much on edge, this enormous manhunt ising an effect on the state's morale. texas hasn't seen a gang like this since the and three weeks after they escaped from prison, the seven men are much, much better armed. from texas tonight, abc's mike von fremd. police said today they found blood inside the car the escapes used after they robbed a sporting goods store. now we have very good reason to believe two of the suspects possibly were injured at some point. police are not sure how serious the injuries are, or if they are the result of returned fire from officer aubrey hawkins, who was brutally gunned down by the escapees. his weapon was not recovered. our belief was that the suspects took that weapon with them when they left. officials in texas released these updated sketches of the seven based on new eyewitness information. one example, in the sketches, escapee larry harper now has an infection on his lip. i do not know if it's a cold sore or what, but it's rather vivid. with the massive effort to circulate their pictures, there have been reported sightings in palm beach florida, durango, colorado and multiple sightings in texas. at this bank in san marcos, texas, just south of austin, two witnesses thought they saw the connally seven casing a bank yesterday. and today on the streets people say they are frightened. we're taking precautions. we're locking our doors. when people leave our house at night, we walk them to their cars. yeah, we're all pretty scared. but after reviewing the bank surveillance tape, investigators today say they do not believe the gang was in san marcos. their whereabouts is still a mystery tonight. for the police, their greatest fear is that this will end in a bloodshed. we are obvious targets, driving with an arsenal of weapons and $80,000 in cash, police say it will take patience to catch this group. fbi, they have all that they need to be able to stay out for a long time. that's the reason law enforcement has such a difficult task. you have got to rely also on that funny feeling you get on the back of your neck. and if you get that, you back off a little bit. police across the lone star state have decided that now is not the time to take any chances. mike von fremd, abc news, dallas. little earlier we talked to larry todd, the public information officer for the texas department of criminal justice. mr. todd, are there convicts have been on the run for longer than these men, but these men are clearly good. would you agree? they're cunning, good, heavily armed and they are frightening people in the southwest. are you convinced they have not left texas? we think that they're in texas. we think that they've split up and then the groups come back together. but very frankly, our leads are very, very limited. what we need are good, solid leads. we need license plate numbers and better descriptions. these men have changed their appearance. they have grown facial hair or possibly they altered their appearance through a disguise. several people in texas told me in general the public is not pan oiked but that the law enforcement authorities are, quote, quite afraid. yes, they are afraid. these men are very heavily armed and they've proven that they don't mind using those weps. and we don't know what their plans are, so certainly law enforcement is extremely cautious. we just hope it ends without bloodshed. we think the men might move and make a move this weekend, so we're very cautious. again, we're very prayerful. why do you think they might make a move this weekend? we've got good weather. they've been laying low for quite some time. they've been very patient so far but how far can patience go? many thanks for your time. thanks, sir.

Throughout the day on May 17, 1989, with student-led demonstrators occupying Beijing's Tiananmen Square and paralyzing much of the country, several of China's most powerful figures dropped by the home of the most powerful of them all, Deng Xiaoping, to discuss what to do. ``If things continue like this, we could even end up under house arrest,'' Deng warned his old revolutionary comrades, according to a new book of documents that its editors say are classified Communist Party archives smuggled out of China. ``After thinking long and hard about this, I've concluded that we should bring in the People's Liberation Army and declare martial law in Beijing.'' The documents, which number in the hundreds and have been deemed authentic by several experts, appear in ``The Tiananmen Papers,'' which will be published on Monday. They help explain how China's rulers decided to order a military crackdown that in June 1989 killed hundreds of people and put China's present leadership in place. They also suggest how deeply divided the top leaders were and how close the country came during those protests to embracing political change rather than crushing it. Provided to U.S. scholars in computer printout form by a mysterious Chinese figure who says he represents people in the Communist Party who favor more rapid change, the materials offer an extraordinary window into the inner sanctum of China's political leadership during the Tiananmen crisis. While largely confirming earlier impressions of how the crackdown came about, the documents offer a richly detailed record of the internal arguments, the fears of the elderly leaders and the ways officials manipulated those fears. Inevitably, a central question is how certain one can be of the authenticity of the documents, which include minutes of Politburo meetings, army and intelligence reports and memorandums of meetings that Deng held with his comrades. Several times in recent decades, Chinese documents initially hailed as important were later discredited as probable forgeries. For example, a supposed inside account of the 1971 fall of Mao's designated successor, Lin Biao, was published to great interest in 1983 but is now of dubious credibility. But in interviews, the scholars who have pored over the Tiananmen documents and helped translate and edit them _ and who have grilled the Chinese man who handed them over _ have expressed the firm conviction that the documents are authentic. Even so, they said, they are less certain that the documents accurately capture the reality of the period. ``I believe that the documents are authentic,'' said James R. Lilley, the U.S. ambassador during the protests and one of the few China experts besides the volume's editors to have examined the materials. ``But I don't rule out the possibility that people might have played with the language to score certain points. In addition, the documents themselves contain material that is not true. For example, the reports on the CIA are exaggerated and inflammatory to appeal to the paranoia of the Chinese leadership.'' The documents indicate that the officials who formally held the top posts in China _ the members of the Standing Committee of the Politburo _ were split two to two, with one abstention, over whether to use force to end the demonstrations. Without a majority, the hard-liners lacked the standing to call in the troops and crush the protests. But the deadlock was broken by Deng and his octogenarian comrades, who had retired from most of their official posts in the government or party but still held ultimate power. In this sense, the documents suggest an important conclusion, one that had been surmised before but now emerges more forcefully: that had it not been for Deng and the other elders, the moderates might have prevailed in the power struggle, averting bloodshed and inaugurating a period of greater political openness and economic liberalization. There seems to be little doubt that the documents, which are due to be published in Chinese in April and sold in places like Hong Kong, will slip into China and stir intense interest there, despite an almost complete ban on public discussion of the Tiananmen incident. Disclosure of the documents could erode the authority of the top two Chinese leaders. (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) One is President Jiang Zemin, who was awarded the top post after Deng and the elders dismissed Zhao Ziyang, the Communist Party general secretary, for opposing martial law. The other is Prime Minister Li Peng, then as now the second-ranking figure in the Communist hierarchy, who was named to his post in 1989. Li in particular comes across in the documents as inflaming the elders and manipulating information to encourage them to order a military crackdown. ``The hardliners that pushed the decision to use force, especially Li Peng, are still vulnerable on these issues, and these papers show how they acted,'' said Lilley. ``They show Li to be this guy with very little tolerance of dissent, recommending harsh action from the beginning.'' (END OPTIONAL TRIM) The Tiananmen demonstrations began in mid-April 1989, at first to mourn the death of Hu Yaobang, a former party leader and a symbol of political reform. The mourning soon turned into vast demonstrations demanding a free press, more open and representative government, a crackdown on corruption and inflation and independent labor unions. The translated collection of documents is being published by PublicAffairs, a non-fiction publishing house in New York. The documents were provided to U.S. scholars by a man who goes by a pseudonym, Zhang Liang, and who is unwilling to be further identified. Zhang, who has not disclosed his real name, former position or present whereabouts, said in an interview in the New York apartment of one of the book's editors that his purpose was to stimulate a reassessment inside China about the Tiananmen movement, which is officially branded a criminal uprising. He says that he is a member of the Communist Party who, with his friends, has tried to have the official judgment on Tiananmen reconsidered, an act that they believe essential if China is to become a more democratic society. But having been rebuffed in that effort, they decided to have the Tiananmen materials published outside China. ``To publish in the United States was our last choice, which we made only when there were no other options,'' Zhang said. He would provide no details on how the documents were assembled or brought out of China. ``We believe that only the Communist Party has the ability in China to carry out political reform,'' Zhang continued. ``In this sense we are not dissidents trying to operate from outside the system.'' He compared his collaborators to people like Boris Yeltsin, a Communist who eventually helped bring down the Soviet system. The materials run to more than 400 pages in the translated collection, but the Chinese-language version will include three times as much. They cover the six weeks of the Tiananmen crisis and the period immediately after the movement was suppressed. And they shed light on the personalities of some of the top leaders, the questions and fears that obsessed them and their style of debate. Deng, China's supreme leader, who died in 1997, comes across as both infuriated and tormented by the demonstrations, which he saw as deeply damaging to his long-term strategy of economic and political modernization for China. According to the documents, he often voiced the opinion that the students were being manipulated by a ``tiny minority'' of Chinese whose secret, unstated goal was the overthrow of the communist system. Deng seemed to believe this ``minority'' was backed by outside countries, especially the United States. ``Some Western countries use things like `human rights' or like saying the socialist system is irrational or illegal, to criticize us,'' Deng is quoted as saying on June 2, as the leaders made plans to use force against the students, ``but what they're really after is our sovereignty.'' Estimates of the number of people killed are far lower in the documents than among some foreign observers. Two days after the crackdown, Li is quoted as telling the elders that about 23 soldiers and 200 civilians had been killed; foreign estimates ranged from several hundred to several thousand or more. The documents paint a picture of the party elders losing faith in Zhao and discussing various candidates to replace him. Early on, they indicate, Deng seemed to favor Li Ruihuan, a moderate with a reputation as open-minded about political and economic change. But other senior figures in the leadership are quoted as favoring Jiang, the party secretary of Shanghai, whom they praised for his resolute and hardline stance in closing down what was then China's boldest newspaper. Deng, who comes across in the transcripts as the key figure but also as deferential to other elders like Chen Yun and Li Xiannian, apparently allowed himself to be convinced. ``Comrades Chen Yun and Xiannian and I all lean toward Comrade Jiang Zemin for general-secretary,'' Deng is quoted as announcing later at a meeting of elders at his house. ``What do the rest of you think?'' The documents show the rest of the elders readily agreeing, and that apparently is how Jiang came to vault over many more senior people to be China's top leader. Andrew Nathan, a Columbia University political scientist and the volume's main editor, collaborated in turning the documents into a book with two other experts on China, Perry Link, a literature scholar at Princeton University, and Orville Schell, a writer on Chinese affairs who is now the dean of the Journalism School at the University of California at Berkeley. These scholars examined the documents over many months. One cause of concern about the Tiananmen collection was the form of the materials provided by Zhang. They were not original documents but a computer printout of them. They also lack the flavor of real conversations, with their incomplete sentences, hesitations and interruptions. As is standard with such Chinese documents, they appear to have been edited. But Schell and the other scholars list reasons that convinced them that the collection is genuine. Among them are the inclusion of Chinese intelligence reports on activities and statements by Western experts in closed meetings that never became part of the public record. Nathan and Lilley both said that they had been able to track down some of the people referred to in the Chinese documents and verify the accuracy of the Chinese reports.

Defense Secretary William Cohen plans to order a new review to determine whether military commanders in the Persian Gulf should be held accountable for any security lapses that contributed to the bombing of the destroyer Cole in Yemen last October, Pentagon officials said Friday. The review raises the possibility that any punishment resulting from the attack could include high-ranking commanders in the Persian Gulf region. One official said the review would be led by the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Army Gen. Henry Shelton. Cohen's decision came after a Defense Department commission concluded that there were significant security shortcomings in the region before a skiff packed with explosives attacked the Cole as it stopped to refuel in the Yemeni port of Aden on Oct. 12, killing 17 sailors and wounding 39 others. That commission _ led by two retired commanders, Adm. Harold Gehman and Army Gen. William Crouch _ avoided assigning blame, focusing instead on improving security for U.S. forces in the region. But its findings, which the Pentagon plans to make public next week, have raised enough questions to merit a review of the actions of commanders who oversee military operations in the Persian Gulf region, the officials said. In a separate Navy inquiry that focused on actions about the Cole, an investigator concluded last month that the destroyer's captain and crew failed to follow a series of strict security procedures on the day it stopped in Yemen to refuel. The finding raises the prospect of disciplinary action against the Cole's captain, Cmdr. Kirk Lippold, and others aboard the destroyer. A final report of that inquiry Friday reached Adm. Vern Clark, who as chief of naval operations is the Navy's senior officer. Navy officials emphasized that Clark, like other commanders below him, had the authority to revise any findings of fault before the investigation was considered complete. Cohen's decision to order a new accountability review may address some Navy officials' concerns by reviewing whether lapses beyond the actions of the Cole's crew might have left the destroyer vulnerable. The officials declined to identify any officers whose actions would be the focus of the new inquiry, saying it would be wrong to prejudge the review. But the report of the commission led by Gehman and Crouch, which is being put into final form this weekend, has raised questions about whether officers in the U.S. Central Command did enough to share intelligence reports with the Cole's officers, even if none were specific enough to warrant calling off the Cole's refueling stop in Yemen on the day of the attack. ``There was sufficient intelligence that should have prompted warnings,'' one Defense Department official said, summarizing the commission's findings. Ever since the Cole attack, the Pentagon has been under intense pressure, particularly from lawmakers on Capitol Hill, to determine whether anything could have been done to prevent the bombing, which tore a ragged 40-foot-by-40-foot hole in the destroyer's port side. But the new inquiry, like the Navy's, may conclude that there was little, short of avoiding refueling in Yemen, that would have prevented what was clearly a meticulously planned suicide bombing. While the report of the commission led by Gehman and Crouch identifies problems with protecting U.S. forces in the region, it will not attribute the Cole bombing to any one lapse, the officials said. For that reason, it could be difficult for a new review to ascribe blame to individual commanders. Cohen's decision to order a new review will effectively leave any findings of fault to President-elect George W. Bush's choice as the next defense secretary, Donald Rumsfeld.

as the search for seven escaped texas prison inmates continues, officials are declining comment on a possible account of how they got out. houston tv station khou says it has obtained an internal memo from the texas department of criminal justice detailing the december escape. it says six of the inmates told civilian supervisors they were going to hold a "spread," a picnic-style lunch with inmates bringing commissary food to their work area. 11 civilian employees in the area went to lunch, and when they returned, were stripped of their clothing and locked in closets. by then, a seventh inmate had joined the first six. one of the inmates told a guard he was a maintenance supervisor and was sending a crew to install surveillance equipment. those men overpowered the guard and got keys to a truck, which the escapees loaded with guns and ammunition from a prison armory. the memo says they drove away without attracting attention.

In his final days as defense secretary, William Cohen will call for a broader review of accountability for security lapses in connection with the USS Cole bombing, a senior defense official said Saturday. The inquiry will go beyond the Navy's own investigation of the actions of the captain and crew of the Cole, which was attacked by suicide bombers in Aden harbor in Yemen on Oct. 12 as it was refueling. Seventeen sailors were killed. The Navy inquiry last week reached the office of the chief of naval operations, Adm. Vern Clark. It examined in detail the ship's self-protection plan and could lead to disciplinary action against the Cole's commander, Cmdr. Kirk S. Lippold, and perhaps others aboard the destroyer. Cohen wants to see if others in the chain of command above Lippold and possibly outside the Navy should be held accountable. Details of how the assessment will be done, and by whom, have yet to be worked out, said the official, who discussed the matter on condition of anonymity. Cohen has not announced the planned review. Shortly after the terrorist attack, Cohen established a special commission led by a retired Navy admiral and a retired Army general to see what security lessons could be learned from the Cole incident. The commission, whose report is due to be released publicly in a few days, did not assess accountability. The New York Times reported Saturday that Cohen wants a new review to determine whether military commanders in the Persian Gulf, including high-ranking officers, should be punished. The report said the new review would be led by Gen. Henry H. Shelton, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Officials told The Associated Press on Saturday that Cohen has not decided who will lead the inquiry or what form it will take. ``He just wants to create a mechanism for answering the question: Is there an accountability issue?'' one official said. ``It's appropriate to ask the question: Did everyone act as expected?'' He said it may turn out that no one beyond the crew of the Cole will be held accountable. It is not clear how long the additional review would take, but presumably it will wind up being the responsibility of Defense Secretary-designate Donald Rumsfeld, who is set to take over for Cohen on Jan. 20.

in texas, prison officials already angered over the escape of seven dangerous inmates three weeks ago may well be embarrassed tonight. it turns out they may have unwittingly set the stage for the escape by allowing the inmates to picnic unsupervised just before they pulled off their daring escape plan. here's abc's mike von fremd. prison officials have given abc news this confidential memo spelling out the details the day the seven escapees outsmarted the prison guards. the memo, written by a state prison investigator, says the escape began when "11 maintenance workers went to lunch," leaving the inmates unsupervised by a prison guard, which officials today admit is routine in a medium security prison. they had supervision, supervision by a maintenance supervisor. but officials are furious over the investigators' characterization that the inmates were in the maintenance shop enjoying "a picnic of sorts" just before taking hostages. the designation picnic lunch was totally uncalled for. the spokesman says the inmates were simply eating snacks they had purchased in the commissary. the memo says when the guards and prison staff returned to the maintenance shop, "one by one, the inmates took them hostage." the group stole their clothes, then stole a flatbed truck in the prison courtyard and fooled guards into thinking they were about "to install video surveillance equipment." they overpowered the remaining guards and loaded up their truck with 14 revolvers, a rifle, a shotgun and 200 rounds of ammunition, which they later allegedly used to ambush officer aubrey hawkins in a christmas eve robbery of a sporting goods store. officer hawkins' mother is outraged by the details in the memo and says the sloppy security at the prison contributes to the death of her son. it's almost hard for me to grasp that those kinds of things happen, that kind of inefficiency and irresponsibility. i don't understand that. there's no reason for that. it should not have happened. next week, prison officials will release their official account of what went wrong during the escape. tonight, they say the whereabouts of the texas seven remain as much a mystery as ever. mike von fremd, abc news, dallas. as always, you can find full coverage of this developing story at our website, abcnews.com.

"there are open calls for the government to step down," li is quoted as saying, "appeals for nonsense like open investigations into china's governance and power." but the communist party's top official, zhao ziyang begged for restraint. but in the end, it was not the deeply divided chinese government officials who made the call. it was deng xiaoping, who no longer had a government title, but who held ultimate power. shortly after that, army troops shortly after that, army troops opened fire on the students. while some scholars believe that some language in the transcripts may have been altered slightly, the documents have been deemed authentic. we haven't before actually had a look at the other, sort of over the wall, into the leadership compound of china on any of the great decisions that have been made over the last 50 years in such a comprehensive fashion. all of the tiananmen papers will be published in a book due for release monday. the chinese have had no reaction, but officials expect them to strongly question the accuracy of the transcripts. martha raddatz, abc news, washington.

The inquiry will go beyond the Navy's own investigation of the actions of the captain and crew of the Cole, which was attacked by suicide bombers in Aden harbor in Yemen on Oct. 12 as it was refueling.

It examined in detail the ship's self-protection plan and could lead to disciplinary action against the Cole's commander, Cmdr. Kirk S. Lippold, and perhaps others aboard the destroyer. The Washington Post reported in Sunday's editions that the officer who prepared the report to Clark, Adm. Robert J. Natter, concluded that no one should be punished. In doing so, Natter rejected the conclusion of a lower-ranking investigating officer that some security precautions if taken could have mitigated the effects of the explosion. The Post said one apparent reason for Natter's recommendation is that the Navy believes the actions of Lippold after the attack saved the ship from sinking. ``The captain and his senior officers are heroes for what they did to save the ship,'' the Post quoted one Pentagon official familiar with the Navy investigation as saying. The paper said the official, nonetheless, was critical of the Navy's inclination not to discipline anyone. Cohen wants to see if others in the chain of command above Lippold and possibly outside the Navy should be held accountable. Details of how the assessment will be done, and by whom, have yet to be worked out, said the official, who discussed the matter on condition of anonymity. Cohen has not announced the planned review.

An explosion Sunday caused heavy damage at an office of Yemen's opposition Socialist Party near Aden, security officials said. They had no word on casualties. The officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the explosion took place in al-Shueib, a town in Ad-Dali province some 62 miles north of Aden, while party members were out for lunch. The blast destroyed part of the building, including the party's library. Police detained at least three suspects for questioning, the officials added. The officials ruled out that the blast was related to five small bombs in Aden last week that targeted a church, the official news agency, a hotel and two points along a main road. They said it might be related to next month's municipal elections in which the Socialists are expected to take part. Yemen is still recovering from a ruinous 1994 civil war sparked by south Yemeni secessionists. The 1994 conflict nearly tore apart the union reached in 1990 between the conservative north of Yemen and a socialist south. The Socialist Party, which ruled South Yemen until unity, has often accused the government of undemocratic practices. It boycotted the 1999 presidential elections. Also Sunday in Ad-Dali, authorities detained Mohsen Ahmed Seif, a leader of the opposition Rabitah Party, security officials said. The reason for Seif's detention was not clear, but it also appeared linked to the elections, the officials added. The party's followers had not been linked to any pre-election violence. The liberal Rabitah Party, founded in the early 1950s in Aden, has little clout in Yemen. Its leader, Abdul Rahman al-Jefri, lives in exile in London. The U.S. destroyer Cole was in Aden's harbor when it was hit by a suicide bombing that killed 17 American sailors and wounded 39 on Oct. 12.

The Washington Post says the US Admiral overseeing the Navy probe of the terrorist bombing of the USS Cole is recommending that no one be punished despite evidence of security lapses aboard the ship. The October 12th bombing in the port of Aden in Yemen killed seventeen sailors and wounded thirty-nine others. The newspaper says that Admiral Robert Nader, the Commander of the US Atlantic Fleet rejected the conclusions of a lower ranking investigating officer who determined that more security precautions should have been taken.

A key suspect in the attack on the USS Cole told authorities in his confession that he believes the suicide bombers acted on the orders of Osama bin Laden, Yemeni sources close to the investigation said Monday. The suspect's comments provide another in a series of circumstantial links between the Saudi exile and the deadly attack on the U.S. warship. The sources did not identify the man, but described him as one of the three chief suspects in custody. He and up to seven others are expected to be tried, perhaps as early as this month, in the Oct. 12 bombing of the American destroyer that killed 17 U.S. sailors and wounded 39 during a refueling stop at Aden harbor. Yemen's prime minister has said that authorities have identified one of the bombers and were close to identifying the second. Authorities have yet to establish a firm connection to bin Laden, but U.S. law enforcement officials have said previously that several threads link the suspects now held by the Yemenis to the bin Laden organization. Bin Laden, who is living in Afghanistan, has virtually declared war on what he sees as the anti-Islamic United States, and U.S. officials consider him their No. 1 terrorism suspect. The jailed Yemeni man's brother was described as a prominent Arab Afghan, as Islamic fighters who helped push Soviet forces out of Afghanistan in the 1980s are known. The sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the suspect confessed that he helped his brother run one of two safe houses where visiting fellow Arab Afghans would meet. Authorities were searching for the brother, the officials said. The brother's safe house, they said, was in Sa'da province, near the Saudi border, and the other safe house is in Saudi Arabia, though the sources did not say precisely where. The two brothers' home is elsewhere in Sa'da province, they said. The suspect in custody told authorities that an unidentified Syrian man supervises bin Laden's activities in Yemen and Saudi Arabia. The Syrian, he told police, is among 12 to 20 Saudis, Yemenis, Egyptians, Syrians and other Arabs who are close to bin Laden and live with him in Afghanistan. According to the sources, the suspect said all the Afghan Arabs who came to his brother's safe house worked for the Syrian. The two alleged suicide bombers were among a group that the suspect told investigators visited the safe house before the attack on the Cole, the sources said. It was not clear when the visit took place, and the identities of the two bombers have not been released. The suspect said that the Afghan Arabs who came through his safe house were all either preparing attacks or hiding out from authorities, so it was natural for him to assume the two who authorities believe were the suicide bombers were planning something. He told authorities that he had not known what the target would be, sources said. According to the sources, the suspect said the Syrian did not come to the safe house and that he did not believe the man was even in Yemen. Bin Laden, who is of Yemeni descent, recruited Arabs in Yemen to the war in Afghanistan in the 1980s and is believed to draw on them and other Arab Afghans to support a global militant Islamic terror network. According to the sources, the suspect also provided some details about how bin Laden's network operates. They described his confession as saying that: _If a member of the inner circle drops out of sight, an attack is being planned or carried out. Even within the group, nobody is allowed to ask questions about where the missing man has gone. _Only the most trusted of bin Laden's associates are allowed to train in using C-4, the plastic explosive used in the Cole bombing. It is considered an honor to receive the training. It was unclear whether the suspect had signed the confession. Prosecutors in Aden and police ministry officials refused comment on what the sources said. Last year, Yemeni sources said that another suspect in custody, Jamal al-Badawi, told investigators he received telephone instructions for the bombing from a man in the United Arab Emirates whom he had met in Afghanistan during the war. Al-Badawi told investigators that the man, whom he identified as Mohammed Omar al-Harazi, never directly told him he was receiving orders and financing for the attack from bin Laden. But he said al-Harazi's tone and manner had led him to believe that was the case, according to the sources. On Saturday, American and Yemeni investigators visited locations allegedly used by the bombers. They took photographs of the area from where the two bombers allegedly put their explosives-laden boat into the harbor. A fisherman who had seen the suspects near the harbor before the blast was there when 10 to 15 investigators dropped by, about half of them Americans. They spoke briefly with the fisherman before moving on.

China's government on Tuesday rejected newly published documents vividly describing how Chinese leaders split over the crushing of the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, suggesting that the papers are fake. ``Any attempt to play up the matter again and disrupt China by the despicable means of fabricating materials and distorting facts will be futile,'' Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao said in a statement issued early Tuesday morning via the official Xinhua News Agency. The crackdown was ``highly necessary to the stability and development of China,'' Zhu said. He said the ruling Communist Party's ``correct conclusion'' about the 1989 protests would not change.

a report to be released thursday says a prison officer's failure to check identification allowed the escape of seven texas prison inmates. the chairman of the texas board of criminal justice says a disguised inmate was able to pose as a prison worker because of the lapse. but some guards charged the escape, just outside corpus christi, was made possible by staff shortages, poor pay and inadequate training. the inmates -- two convicted killers, two rapists, a child abuser, a kidnapper and a robber -- have been on the run since last month.

Failure of a prison guard to check identification of an inmate purporting to be a worker helped lead to the escape of seven convicts, a report said. The inmates, who remain at large, took 16 weapons and more than 200 rounds of ammunition after overpowering guards during the escape from the the maximum-security Connally Unit near San Antonio Dec. 13. They amassed dozens more weapons in a sporting goods store robbery on Christmas Eve, during which Irving police officer Aubrey Hawkins was shot to death. A $200,000 reward has been offered for the capture of the escapees, who authorities believe are hiding in the Dallas-Fort Worth area. According to a report by the Texas Board of Criminal Justice, which is set to be released Thursday, a guard allowed an inmate clad in street clothes who represented himself as a worker into the guard tower. The inmate overpowered the guard there and opened an exterior gate freeing the other six prisoners. The street clothes came from a maintenance worker who had been overpowered by prisoners in an inmate lunch area, the report said. The report cites the prison guard's failure to follow procedure as the most significant factor in the escape, board chairman Mac Stringfellow told the Houston Chronicle in Tuesday's editions. If the guard had followed procedure, the inmates would have remained confined in the prison yard, Stringfellow said. ``If they fail to follow procedures and guidelines, then this sort of thing can happen. That's where the problem lies,'' he said. On Monday, Acting Lt. Gov. Bill Ratliff urged the Senate Criminal Justice Committee to look into causes of the escape. Stringfellow said that he doesn't object to a legislative hearing but that the report would not sugarcoat facts surrounding the escape. ``It points fingers where fingers need to be pointed,'' he said. Texas' prison system has struggled in recent years with high turnover and staff shortages among guards. ``Corrections officers are left between a rock and a hard place,'' said Larry Blanchard, a Beaumont-based field representative for the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, the union that represents guards. ``It's a difficult job to do as it is, and there are not enough of them to have sufficient security measures in place.''

A commission set up to investigate the USS Cole bombing says American forces are still vulnerable to terrorists. The Cole Commission said U.S. troops need more protection when they are in transit, especially in harbors and airports. The panel's reports said the Cole bombing shows the need for more attention and more funding to be given to intelligence gathering. The commission headed by a retired Admiral and a retired General did not address the question of whether the captain or crew did enough to avoid the attack. The Navy is planning to release a report on that issue soon.

A Pentagon report called Tuesday for improved intelligence gathering to prevent terrorist attacks like the one in Yemen last October against the US destroyer Cole. The report also urged each of the military services to give regional commanders full time specialists in anti-terrorism. The report was commissioned by Defense Secretary William Cohen. We have focused we have done a great job in terms of force protection during the last four years in improving it. We have not done as good a job in terms of so called intransit force protection. And if we're going to continue our engagement policy and send our ships into areas that do pose risk to our sailors, then we're on fixed installations that we got to take more pro-active measures, not simply act out of a defense oriented mentality but to take a much more aggressive stance. Secretary Cohen said the report's major conclusion is that terrorists must be viewed as relentless enemies.

Edmond Pope, convicted by Russia of spying but quickly pardoned, has a contract to write a book about the ordeal, his agent said Tuesday. Norman Brokaw, said Pope's memoir would be published by Little, Brown and Co. Terms of the deal and a publication date were not released. Pope, 54, a former naval officer and a businessman, was arrested on spy charges April 3 in Moscow. He was convicted Dec. 6 of buying plans for a high-speed Russian torpedo and sentenced to 20 years in prison. Russian President Vladimir Putin pardoned Pope before Christmas, citing his health problems and Russia's desire to maintain good relations with the United States.

MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ U.S. Open champion Marat Safin, slowed by a sore elbow, was beaten in the first round of an Australian Open tuneup Wednesday. ``I'm afraid of making it worse. I don't want to be out six months,'' Safin said after his 6-2, 6-1 loss to France's Nicolas Escude in the Colonial Classic. In other matches, Spanish Davis Cup hero Juan Carlos Ferrero beat Pete Sampras 6-2, 6-4, and Olympic gold medalist Yevgeny Kafelnikov defeated two-time U.S. Open champion Patrick Rafter 6-2, 6-2. ``It just takes a couple of matches,'' said Sampras, who took a break from competition for most of last fall. ``That's why this week is a perfect preparation.'' Safin planned to see a doctor later Wednesday, and decide then whether to continue in the eight-man exhibition tournament. ``If the doctor says I can play, I will play,'' he added. ``You have to be careful. Simple things can change your life.'' He said six months would be the recuperation period if surgery were needed. The Australian Open, the year's first Grand Slam tournament, starts next Monday. Safin, who climbed to No. 2 in the rankings after a dismal start in 2000, was fined for not trying at last year's Australian. He has said he wants to show his true abilities this time. Safin said a similar elbow problem kept him out of action for more than a month 18 months ago. The problem started flaring up again last week, he said. Safin said the soreness apparently indicated he was doing something wrong in his strokes, and would have to fix it. He also said he did not have a coach with him here. The 20-year-old Russian made frequent groundstroke errors, and occasionally bounced his racket off the court in frustration. ``It's difficult to play when you start to think about being sore,'' he said. In later first-round matches, Pete Sampras was to play Juan Carlos Ferrero, and Andre Agassi faced Nicolas Kiefer.

The prison where seven heavily armed inmates escaped last month was short-staffed by almost two dozen guards on the day of the breakout, according to a union official. Brian Olsen, deputy director of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, conceded that guards made mistakes during the escape, but criticized the Legislature for failing to address staff shortages. ``I am still under the belief that lack of staffing is at the root of the problem,'' Olsen told The Dallas Morning News. ``Someone has to take some responsibility, and I think it's at the Capitol.'' State Sen. John Whitmire said Olsen's criticisms were ill-advised. ``I quite frankly don't believe now is the proper time to be discussing blame for the escape. Everyone's attention should be on the capture and placing these individuals back in prison,'' he said. Olsen said the Texas Department of Criminal Justice's Connally Unit in Kenedy was 22 officers short. Glen Castlebury, a Department of Criminal Justice spokesman, acknowledged the likelihood of vacancies, but said he was unsure how many the prison might have had. State prison officials have identified lax security, including a guard's failure to request identification from one inmate as he approached the guard tower, as a significant factor in the escapes. The manhunt for the prisoners has intensified in recent weeks, in the wake of a Christmas Eve robbery at a sporting goods store allegedly committed by the inmates. A police officer was killed in the robbery.

An exiled former president and 16 others have registered to enter Peru's April 8 presidential vote, kicking off the race to replace disgraced former President Alberto Fujimori. Political parties rushed Monday to register their candidates with the National Elections Board before a midnight deadline. Among the hopefuls was front-running opposition leader Alejandro Toledo, a U.S.-trained economist whose powerful speeches rallied tens of thousands of Peruvians in protest of Fujimori's authoritarian rule. Another was exiled former President Alan Garcia, whose populist 1985-90 administration was marred by hyperinflation, guerrilla violence and corruption. Garcia, a fiery orator who still faces arrest here, fled to Colombia in 1992 amid corruption charges. His left-leaning Aprista party has been pressuring the courts to halt legal action against him. Election officials registered of 10 candidates from established political parties. Meanwhile, candidates from seven new parties were accepted conditionally. Fujimori called elections for this April, cutting short his third five-year term to only one year, after the release in September of a video showing his fugitive ex-spy chief Vladimiro Montesinos apparently bribing a congressman. Fujimori later fled to Japan, his ancestral homeland, amid ensuing corruption scandals, and was replaced by interim President Valentin Paniagua, whose mandate is to hold clean election in April and turn power over to a new government next July.

The brazen escape of seven inmates from a maximum-security Texas prison last month has quickly become the stuff of a crime thriller whose ending is not yet known. The escapees remain at large, elusive despite a huge manhunt that has intensified since the fugitives were charged with the Christmas Eve slaying of a police officer. But as investigators follow up more than 2,000 tips, all but a few leading nowhere, the prison break has prompted broader concerns about security inside the Texas prison system _ now the largest in the country _ and a political debate about how to respond. Prison officials say the system remains secure but they agree it is under a growing strain. Statistics show that the system, with as many as 160,000 inmates in 116 prisons _ is near capacity and that incidents of violence between inmates and against guards has risen precipitously. Because of the dangerous conditions and low pay, union officials say, prison guards, have been leaving in droves. ``It's a tough situation, I'm not denying that,'' said Mac Stringfellow, chairman of the Texas Board of Criminal Justice, which oversees the prison system. ``I think we're doing the best we can with what we've got.'' On Thursday morning, Stringfellow is scheduled to present a report explaining exactly what happened on Dec. 13, when the inmates escaped from the Connally Unit in south Texas. They managed to subdue several prison employees, take their clothes and escape by convincing a guard that they were maintenance workers. Stringfellow attributed the escape to ``several breakdowns'' in procedure by individual guards, which he said will be outlined in the report. ``This is a tragic, one-time, isolated event,'' he said. ``What happened down in Connally is certainly not systemic.'' But others say that to blame the incident solely on a handful of guards ignores the larger problems facing the system, namely that too few guards are responsible for a growing number of hardened offenders serving longer sentences with less incentive to behave. Union officials representing prison guards say that the Connally unit was understaffed by 22 officers at the time of the escape, including a guard who should have been positioned at the gate where the inmates left. ``We think it's at a crisis stage,'' said Brian Olsen, deputy director of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, which represents about 4,000 of the state's roughly 23,500 corrections officers. Over the past 18 months, the union has held protests, asking Gov. George W. Bush to call a special legislative session to address work conditions and salaries. In December 1999, one guard involved in a such a protest, Daniel Nagle, was later stabbed to death by an inmate. Bush did not call a special session but he took administrative steps that resulted in an annual raise of about $1,000 for guards. The union says that salaries for prison guards start at $18,000 a year and reach a maximum of $28,000, placing Texas 43rd national in pay for corrections officers. Olsen said this has contributed to a staff shortage of an estimated 2,500 guards. Prison attrition statistics show that about 1 in 5 corrections officers quit last year. Ken Armbrister, chairman of Criminal Justice Committee of the Texas Senate, said a hearing would probably be held next week in which lawmakers intended to question prison officials about the escape and discuss broader questions. Armbrister agreed that the system is straining. One study by state criminal justice officials found that Texas would need another 15,000 prison beds by 2005 if crime rates and current criminal justice policy remained the same. But Armbrister said that lawmakers are increasingly unconvinced that building more prisons and increasing salaries even more are the answers to the problems the system is facing. He predicted that wider use of electronic monitoring and other methods would be explored. For the past decade, Texas has spent billions on a huge prison construction program, more than tripling its inmate population and overtaking California in having the largest number of inmates. ``As long as our mindset is to just keep on building, how smart can that be?'' asked Armbrister. Prison statistics show that the number of escapes throughout the system has actually dropped since the mid-1990s. Stringfellow said that all but 1 of the 245 inmates who had escaped in the history of the state's prison system had been caught. That lone exception is currently in Mexico. But the statistics also show that violence inside the prisons has risen sharply in recent years, with the number of attacks on guards more than doubling from 1996 to 2000, from 918 to 2,267. The Fort Worth Star-Telegram this week reported that the same Connally Unit from which the inmates escaped has reported 752 assaults against employees since it opened in July 1995, the most of any Texas prison unit. Charles Terrell, a former chairman of the Texas Board of Criminal Justice, has warned in recent weeks that the escape should not be dismissed as an aberration but a symptom of the ``hardening'' of the prison population as more inmates are serving longer sentences with less chance for parole. He noted that the escapees were actually in a position of trust at Connally, working on a maintenance crew, despite the fact that two were killers, two were armed robbers and the other three had been convicted of child abuse, rape and burglary. ``The scariest thing is, it could happen again and again, because you've got more and more inmates who are doing jobs in the prison who don't have anything to lose,'' Terrell said. Last week, an inmate in the prison system who was taken to a hospital at Lubbock after swallowing a can opener briefly escaped and took two nurses hostage. He was later captured and charged with sexually assaulting both women. Prison officials note that they have been planning for this hardening of the inmate population for more than five years, including building five new units designed to house more violent, longer-term offenders. Glen Castlebury, a spokesman for the prison system, said that prisons have always been violent places to work. As the tips on the prison escapees continue to mount, none appear to have brought investigators anything solid on where the criminals might be. Unconfirmed sightings of the men, who are believed to still be together, have been reported throughout Texas and in Oklahoma, Colorado, Louisiana and New Mexico. A reward of $200,000 is being offered for information leading to an arrest.

Andre Agassi survived three match points en route to a 3-6, 7-5, 6-1 victory over France's Nicolas Escude on Thursday in the Colonial Classic semifinals. Pete Sampras lost his second consecutive match in the warmup tournament for the Australian Open, falling 6-4, 7-6 (5) to Australia's Patrick Rafter. Sampras lost to Spain's Juan Carlos Ferrero on Wednesday. Rafter caused a stir not only with his victory, but also by saying he probably would retire at the end of this year. Sampras is seeded third for the Open, which starts Monday. Defending champion Agassi is sixth and Rafter 12th. After surviving the three match points in the second set, Agassi lost only one more game. ``I was disgusted with myself because I was about to lose serve, and you want to make him close you out. I hit a few good serves and managed to hold,'' Agassi said. ``When I got back into the match, I started making fewer mistakes.'' In the final, he will meet the winner of Friday's semifinal between Ferrero and Yevgeny Kafelnikov. Sampras said he was not overly concerned about his two losses, but hoped to win his match Friday in the losers' bracket. ``As long as I'm hitting the ball well and feeling well, I think I'm getting there,'' said Sampras, who has won a record 13 Grand Slam singles titles. ``When you win matches, you build confidence, but if I can play better today than yesterday, I can kind of build on it and work on a few things this weekend,'' he added. Rafter, a two-time U.S. Open champion and the losing finalist against Sampras at Wimbledon last year, gained his first-set break in the seventh game with a forehand at Sampras' feet. The two then traded breaks in the middle of the second set. Serving at 5-4 in the tiebreaker, Rafter lost the point on a foot fault, but then served an ace and belted a serve return too wide for Sampras to handle. Despite saying this probably was his last Australian Open, Rafter said, ``I don't feel any pressures, I don't feel any relief.'' He said he has decided to go all out for the whole year, and ``it is not just the Australian Open thing.''

Suspected terrorist Osama bin Laden was shown on satellite television Thursday reciting an ode to Jerusalem at his son's wedding, saying Israel's hold on the city holy to Christians, Jews and Muslims was ``burning him from within.'' Bin Laden was shown on Qatar's Al-Jazeera reciting the poem at his son's wedding in the southern Afghan city of Kandahar. The wedding was Tuesday. ``The wound of Jerusalem is making me boil. Its suffering is making me burn from within,'' an emotional bin Laden said during the ceremony. The sovereignty of Jerusalem is one of the most explosive issues between Palestinians and Israelis. Bin Laden, a Saudi dissident believed to direct a global terrorist network from his Afghan exile, has vowed in the past to fight the ``enemies of Islam'' _ an apparent reference to the United States, Israel and the Saudi royal family. Footage of the wedding was first shown by Al-Jazeera on Wednesday, but that broadcast did not include the elder bin Laden speaking. Thursday's broadcast showed the young groom, Mohammed, sitting on a carpet between his father and another man believed to be the bride's father, Abu Hafas al-Masri, an Egyptian aide to the elder bin Laden who fought with him in the 1980s against Soviet forces in Afghanistan. The bride was not shown and her name was not given. There were reports last year that bin Laden, a millionaire, was suffering from kidney and liver disease. In the footage he was smiling and appeared healthy. Bin Laden has been indicted by the United States for the 1998 bombings of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. Days after the bombings, the United States fired dozens of Tomahawk cruise missiles on eastern Afghanistan in an attempt to kill him. Al-Jazeera reported Wednesday that wedding guests included Ayman el-Zawahiri, the leader of Egypt's Jihad, a militant group blamed for the 1981 assassination of Egyptian President Anwar Sadat. El-Zawahiri is one of Egypt's most wanted men and known to be a close bin Laden aide. The Taliban hardline militia that rules Afghanistan has so far refused to hand bin Laden over to the United States. Last month, the United Nations imposed fresh sanctions on the Taliban to press demands that they hand over bin Laden for trial in the United States or a third country. In a separate Al-Jazeera interview broadcast Thursday, Taliban leader Mullah Mohammed Omar brushed aside the effects of the sanctions, saying his group was impervious to pressure.

the search for seven escaped convicts continues in texas. authorities are posting roadblocks near the mexican border. meanwhile, prison officials have reconstructed the breakout and say they now know what went wrong. alexa lee reports. the escape, now being called one of the most intricate breakout plans in state history, occurred in the span of 2 1/2 hours. it included a strategy of overpowering guards and staff one-by-one, stealing weapons and clothes, and then driving off the grounds of the connally unit in kenedy, texas. in retrospect, the events of december 2000, fit together like a puzzle. we just didn't put the pieces together fast enough. the texas department of criminal justice released a 16-page report detailing how seven convicts escaped on december the fugitives, considered extremely dangerous, are wanted for the shooting death of a police officer on christmas eve. among numerous security breakdowns cited, the report includes the failure of a back gate guard to get proper identification before letting the inmates into a guard tower. the inmates had pretended to install security cameras. what should have happened was they should have been identified before the gates were ever opened. the inmates also took 11 employees and 3 prisoners hostage in an electrical circuit room, stripped them, and bound them with tape and plastic ties. another guard was also taken hostage at a different location. texas corrections officials say they have no evidence a staff shortage is to blame. the mother of slain officer aubrey hawkins is calling for accountability and responsibility rather than finger-pointing. and let's waste no more time. other people will most likely get hurt in capturing these people. it's gonna break my -- my heart is already broken. alexa lee, "headline news."

A rare ox called an Asian gaur, cloned and gestated in the womb of a cow in a scientific first, was born this week but died two days later of an ordinary disease, scientists announced Friday. Scientists claimed bittersweet victory in the experiment, which used technology they hope can help shore up the numbers of endangered animals. The Asian gaur (pronounced ``gour'') is endangered. The baby gaur, a bull named Noah, was born Monday at TransOva Genetics in Sioux Center, Iowa, and died from common dysentery Wednesday. The project united the technology of cloning with that of an interspecies birth. Noah was the first animal to gestate in the womb of another species and survive through the late stages of fetal development. Five other cows that became pregnant with cloned gaur fetuses spontaneously aborted them. ``The data collected clearly indicates that cross-species cloning worked, and as a scientist, I'm pleased,'' said Philip Damiani, a researcher with Advanced Cell Technology, a Boston-based company that sponsored the research. A necropsy of the gaur concluded that its death was not a result of cloning or gestation in another species, said company vice president Robert Lanza, vice president of medical and scientific development at ACT. However, scientists plan to study the gaur's death further. ``We don't think it had to do with the cloning,'' he said. ``Dysentery affects farm animals, and the mortality rate can approach 100 percent.'' To create Noah, scientists used the single cell of a dead gaur implanted into a cow's egg. They first removed the DNA from the cow's egg, ensuring that the interspecies pregnancy produced a gaur, not a gaur-cow mix, Damiani said. Gaur, native to India and Burma, are brownish-black animals with white legs, a pronounced shoulder hump and horns that curve inward. The largest of wild cattle, an adult male gaur can reach a shoulder height of 6 feet and weigh up to a ton, with horns 2 feet long. ``Despite this setback, the birth of Noah is grounds for hope,'' Lanza said. ``We still have a long way to go, but as this new technology evolves, it has the potential to save dozens of endangered species.'' Bessie, an ordinary black and white Angus cow, gave birth under the watchful gaze of geneticists. The experiment cost Advanced Cell Technology around $200,000, Damiani said. Some scientists warn that biotechnology is advancing at a pace so fast that society does not have time to ponder its meaning. Just Thursday, scientists in Oregon announced they had created the world's first genetically modified primate _ a baby rhesus monkey born last fall with some jellyfish DNA in its genetic makeup. Commenting on the Iowa research, Gary Comstock, director of Iowa State University's Bioethics Program, said scientists must answer to whether the bioengineered animals will be healthy and whether they will have a place to live. ``If the environment changes, the newly cloned animals may lead miserable lives if they are unable to pursue their instincts and desires,'' Comstock said. ``They can't live here any more _ that's why they are extinct. ``We need broader types of habitat the animals can live in. Just preserving the species is too narrow a vision.'' Advanced Cell Technology already has plans to clone an extinct Spanish mountain goat called the bucardo, which is native to the Pyrenees. The cells will be taken from the last bucardo, which died and was frozen last year. But the gaur birth won't bring a rush of scientists producing extinct and endangered species, said George Amato, director of Science Resource Center at The Bronx Zoo in New York. ``It's complicated, expensive and it doesn't work all the time,'' he said. ``It's not an answer to the extinction crisis.'' For instance, the procedure won't resurrect the extinct Dodo bird because scientists don't have its genetic makeup. Also, some endangered animals don't have any living surrogates that are suitable matches. While the gaur and cow are close in the animal kingdom, Amato said, there aren't any strong surrogate candidates to produce the rare Tibetan antelope, for example. ___ On the Net: Advanced Cell Technology: http://www.advancedcell.com/ TransOva Genetics: http://www.transova.com/home.html

If winning a rematch of last year's Colonial Classic final is any indication, Andre Agassi is ready to defend his Australian Open title. In a match with some brilliant shotmaking, Agassi stopped Yevgeny Kafelnikov 6-3, 3-6, 6-3 on Saturday in a battle that featured the two men who played for the Australian Open title a year ago. After a year in which he battled injuries, Agassi was satisfied with the victory. ``I feel good about the way I'm moving, the way I'm striking the ball, and I still feel I can get a lot better,'' Agassi said. The Open starts Monday, with Agassi seeded sixth and Kafelnikov fifth, behind Gustavo Kuerten, Marat Safin, Pete Sampras and Magnus Norman. When Agassi beat Kafelnikov in last year's final, it capped a sizzling streak in which he also won the U.S. and French Opens and was runner-up to Sampras at Wimbledon. Then a fall on court at Queens and an automobile accident took him out of much of the summer. The 30-year-old former No. 1 broke Kafelnikov in Saturday's sixth game with a display of control tennis, but then was broken in the second game of the second set when the Russian forced him into some errors. Agassi needed two consecutive points with shots that hit the lines to break again in the final set's fourth game. Kafelnikov broke right back with some spectacular serve returns, but then faltered while trailing 4-3. He double-faulted and missed two groundstrokes before Agassi sealed his decisive service break with a forehand blast that Kafelnikov couldn't handle. Agassi then served out the 1-hour, 20-minute match, finishing with a backhand crosscourt winner deep in the corner. ``When we're both making our shots, it's pretty explosive tennis,'' he said. ``There were still a few loose points that cost me a couple of service breaks,'' he added. Agassi, who opens against Czech player Jiri Vanek, is in the same quarter of the Open draw with Sampras. ``The quarterfinals are a long way off. If it was to come down to Pete in the quarters, I always contend it is better to play Pete in the quarters or semis than it is in the final,'' Agassi said. He beat Sampras in a dramatic semifinal last year. Sampras also played in the Colonial, losing to Juan Carlos Ferrero and Patrick Rafter before beating Nicolas Kiefer. Kafelnikov said his match with Agassi came down to a few points, and ``it is a good sign that I had three good matches with tough opponents so I can carry on that kind of confidence.'' ``We both like to dictate the game, and if we are on the top of our form it is very hard to beat us,'' Kafelnikov said. Kafelnikov reached the final with victories over Rafter and Ferrero. Agassi needed three sets for all his victories, winning earlier matches against Kiefer and Nicolas Escude. ``I'm probably at 75 percent of my full capability,'' said Kafelnikov, who plays Germany's Jens Knippschild in the Open. ``I'm going to work a little on my serve.'' Ferrero beat Escude 6-3, 7-5 in the third-place match at the Colonial.

Former President Reagan was said to be in stable condition in anticipation of surgery on Saturday to repair his broken right hip. Reagan, 89, was ``fully alert, in good humor and in stable condition'' after being rushed by ambulance to St. John's Health Center on Friday, his spokeswoman Joanne Drake said. Reagan suffered ``a simple fall'' at his Bel-Air home and probably would need to have a pin installed in his hip, she said. His wife, Nancy, was at his side. A nursing supervisor said the Reagan family had asked the hospital not to comment. Drake said that Reagan's children were notified, including eldest daughter Maureen, who has been undergoing cancer treatments for melanoma at the same hospital since Dec. 11. Reagan disclosed in November 1994 in a passionate letter to the American people that he had Alzheimer's disease and had begun the journey ``into the sunset of my life.'' The two-term president faded from the public eye a short time later and has rarely been seen outside his home. He discontinued going to his Century City office in 1999 but still made trips to parks and enjoyed strolls on the Venice Beach boardwalk with his Secret Service contingent. An estimated 250,000 people, mostly elderly, break their hips every year in the United States, according to the National Institutes of Health. Only one-quarter of hip fracture patients make a full recovery and 20 percent die within a year, according to the American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons. Half of patients need a cane or walker, and 40 percent go from hospital to a nursing home. At 69, Reagan was the oldest man ever elected president when he was chosen on Nov. 4, 1980, by an unexpectedly large margin over incumbent Democrat Jimmy Carter. His public image was one of rugged good health. He chopped wood and rode horses during his visits to his former Santa Barbara County ranch. On March 30, 1981, Reagan was leaving a Washington hotel after addressing labor leaders when a young drifter, John Hinckley, fired six gunshots at him. A bullet lodged an inch from Reagan's heart, but he recovered fully. He was re-elected in 1984 by an even greater margin, carrying 49 states in defeating Democrat Walter Mondale. Reagan was born on Feb. 6, 1911, in Tampico, Ill., and acquired the nickname ``Dutch'' as a baby. After college he began a career as a sports broadcaster, then jumped into acting with a role as a radio announcer in the 1937 film ``Love is on the Air.'' His movie career took off with the role of halfback George Gipp in ``Knute Rockne, All-American,'' permanently associating Reagan with the coach's exhortation to ``win one for the Gipper.'' Reagan served multiple terms as president of the Screen Actors Guild starting in 1947 and then ran for California governor, beating Democratic incumbent Edmund G. ``Pat'' Brown in the 1966 election and winning re-election in 1970. In the meantime he became a last-minute Republican candidate for president in 1968, but Richard Nixon was already the favorite. Reagan unsuccessfully challenged President Gerald Ford in 1976, then emerged as the GOP front-runner four years later. ___ On the Web: Hip information from American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons: http://orthoinfo.aaos.org/ The Reagan Foundation: www.reaganfoundation.org/

medical correspondent elizabeth cohen says reagan's alzheimer's disease could have played a role in his accident and may also be a factor in his recovery. she spoke with cnn's miles o'brien this morning. alzheimer's patients have a much higher chance of taking a fall for obvious reasons. they are not -- alzheimer's patients sometimes forget how to walk. they just don't move as well. not for physical reasons, but because of what's going on in their brain, because the disease affects the brain. now, the surgery itself really wouldn't be any different for an alzheimer's patient than for somebody who doesn't have alzheimer's. but the recovery could be very different. the patient's mental state is crucial for the rehabilitation because they need to follow the directions of the physical therapist. they also need to have the will to recover, and they need to understand exactly what it is that they're going through. again that was cnn medical correspondent elizabeth cohen. for the latest on mr. reagan's surgery and his prognosis, stay tuned to "headline news." we'll have updates throughout the day.

President-elect George W. Bush said Friday that he planned to review and possibly roll back some of the most ambitious initiatives that President Clinton has taken in recent days, including regulations that put nearly 60 million acres of the nation's forests off limits to development. ``I understand the Western mentality, and I want the Western mentality represented in this administration,'' Bush said of his own land use policies. In an interview, he emphasized that ``we've got lawyers looking at every single issue, every single opportunity'' to reverse actions Clinton has taken in the waning weeks of his presidency. He also described what could well become a new, tougher approach toward Russia, limiting aid for its conversion to a market economy, and he elaborated on several other foreign policy issues. Previewing one of the most closely watched decisions he will face in his first month in office, he signaled that he was inclined to use an executive order to stop the flow of American money to any international organizations that provide abortions in foreign countries. ``Organizations that promote abortions are organizations I don't want to support'' with American taxpayer dollars, Bush said. Bush's remarks came in a 75-minute interview in the family room of his renovated farmhouse here, followed by less formal conversation during a 90-minute tour of his ranch and a hike up a limestone canyon to his favorite waterfall. Along the way _ stopping at moments to admire the middle fork of the Bosque River rushing through his land or to point out a buzzard _ the man who will become the 43rd president of the United States on Jan. 20 also talked about his legislative priorities, his inaugural address and the diplomatic troubles he anticipates with Moscow and Beijing over his plans to deploy a national missile defense system. Bush was dismissive of the Clinton administration's eight-year-long use of direct financial aid to Russia, part of a broad Western effort to coax the country toward the development of a market economy. He suggested he would try to stop the money _ except for that used to dismantle nuclear weapons _ until Vladimir Putin, the Russian president, cleaned up corruption and enacted far-reaching economic and legal reforms. ``It's hard for America to fashion Russia,'' Bush said. ``It just seems like to me that we don't want to be lending money and/or encourage the lending of money into a system in which the intention of the capital is never fulfilled,'' he said. ``The intent of the capital was to encourage entrepreneurship and growth and markets.'' According to the General Accounting Office, the United States has spent roughly $2.3 billion since 1992 promoting democracy, the rule of law and market reforms in Russia, but the annual disbursements have tailed off steeply since the Russian financial crisis of 1998. The International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, institutions in which the United States is the largest single shareholder, have issued loans to Russia over the same period worth approximately $30 billion. Taken together, Bush's comments amounted to a sketchy road map for his first 100 days in office. By making it clear that he would rigorously review Clinton's environmental orders and suggesting he might reverse the Clinton administration's position on aid to family planning groups working overseas, he was embracing some favorite causes of his conservative base, especially the Western states he called ``that big swath of red on the map'' _ a region of contiguous states he swept as he took the presidency in the narrowest of victories. In the case of reversing Clinton's forest policy, which was made final this month, after years of painstaking review and public comment, Bush would face many legal restraints. In the interview he acknowledged that his lawyers would have to look carefully at what options were open. His comments on Russia, if converted into policy, could lead to a fundamental change in the way the United States seeks to influence the behavior of a nation that was once its chief superpower rival _ and it risks heightening suspicions in Russia of how America is leveraging its economic and military power. In the interview, Bush also made the following points: _ He said his inaugural address, which he hopes to keep to 12 minutes, would carry the message that ``we can be a unified America.'' But he insisted that this theme was not the product of his slim victory in the Electoral College, and his loss of the popular vote. _ Bush said he planned to quickly introduce his plan to cut taxes by $1.3 trillion over 10 years as a single bill, perhaps modifying it to deepen the tax cuts in the first few years to spur a slowing economy. Asked if he was willing to negotiate the size of his proposed tax cut with a sharply divided Congress, he shot back: ``The answer is no. I think it's the right number.'' _ He suggested he might be willing to pick up on Clinton's framework for a deal with North Korea to control its production and export of missiles but said it must include provisions to ``verify that they are upholding their end of the agreement.'' If North Korea no longer threatens its neighbors, he said, he would ``take a look'' at reducing American troops on the Korean Peninsula, but only in consultation with South Korea and other Asian allies. _ Bush acknowledged that the economic sanctions imposed on Iraq since the Persian Gulf War have so collapsed that ``they resemble Swiss cheese.'' But while he was critical of Clinton's handling of Iraq, he declined to say what tools he might use to pressure Saddam Hussein. _ The president-elect said he may have erred in commenting on the Federal Reserve's action early this month to cut interest rates, and suggested that to preserve the Fed's independence he would not publicly evaluate its actions as president. ``I kind of read the feedback and tended to agree with it, frankly,'' he said of the criticism he received for enthusiastically backing the half-point cut in short-term rates. Throughout the conversation Bush looked relaxed. He was clearly enjoying a day off puttering around his ranch, brewing coffee for visitors and interrupting the conversation repeatedly to admonish his two friendly but occasionally disobedient dogs, Spot and Barney. But he leaned forward and turned intent when the subject turned to his choice for attorney general, former Sen. John Ashcroft, R-Mo., a religious conservative who he said he knew ``could end up being a lightning rod'' for criticism. He said he expected that Ashcroft's confirmation hearings, which begin Wednesday, would be focused on the designee's comments on civil rights, his fierce opposition to abortion and comments he made supporting leaders of the South in the Civil War. ``They are going to dig up every word the guy uttered,'' Bush said. ``He's going to get to explain them. He explained many of the words he uttered to me.'' The president-elect professed to be unfazed by the withdrawal last week of his choice for labor secretary, Linda Chavez, who had failed to tell the Bush transition team that she had once had an illegal immigrant live in her home and perform occasional house chores. Bush would not say that he had been misled by Chavez, but noted, ``She said she made mistakes,'' and he seemed to agree with that assessment. Bush described his cabinet as ``a very strong group of folks,'' made stronger by their extensive experience in government. ``I'm always mindful of what Sam Rayburn told Lyndon Johnson when he first saw the Kennedy administration,'' he said, referring to the famously gruff former speaker of the House. ``He said, `Gosh, I just wish one of them had run for sheriff.' And that's why I'm very comfortable with an Ashcroft or a Norton. They not only ran for sheriff, they ran for statewide offices.'' Talking like a professor of management at Harvard Business School _ which he attended decades ago _ he said he was working hard to turn his cabinet choices into a cohesive team that is accustomed to his own style. In his two visits to Washington in recent weeks, he noted, he was ``spending time with the folks, just watching everybody interact and letting them see how I respond and my style. I want them to see the decision-making process and how it works.'' He wanted, he insisted, no yes-men or yes-women. ``Here's loyalty,'' he said. ``Loyalty is somebody who walked into my office and says, `Here is my opinion,' or `I hear you are thinking this way. I don't agree with you.''' He made it clear, however, that once he had chosen his path, he expected his cabinet members to voice unanimous support for his decisions in public. At one point Bush said that he had cautioned his press secretary, Ari Fleischer, that at times he would withhold information so that Fleischer could truthfully profess ignorance to reporters _ hardly a new strategy for occupants of the White House. Bush recalled telling Fleischer recently, ``When I tell you you are not going to know something, you say, `Yes, sir.''' Bush made little effort to hide his interest in reversing some of Clinton's recent executive orders and rules. But he cautioned that his aides were still researching whether reversals would be legally or politically possible, noting at one point that some of his actions would require legislation and ``it doesn't take much to block action in the United States Senate,'' where there are now 50 Republicans and 50 Democrats. Bush's views on the administration's recently completed effort to block the development of roadless areas of federal lands, essentially putting those areas off limits to loggers and oil drillers, was complex. Bush himself clearly treasures his natural surroundings _ ``I love land,'' he said while driving around the 1,600 acres he acquired in 1999 _ but he instinctively bridles at the thought that the federal government would trump local officials or private landholders in deciding how that land should be used. ``What I would seek to do is to make sure that our bureaucracies were not trampling the interest of the people _ and the president himself would work with local stakeholders before takings _ such as what the president has done with the roadless areas, for example.'' The word ``takings'' is used to describe government action to limit the use of land, with minimal or no compensation. ``The concept of the federal government taking people's property without compensation is something I agree with Gale Norton on,'' he said. ``It should not. There ought to be a balance between obviously the public interest and private property. And a lot of people in my state and in the Western states feel that balance is not there.'' He reiterated his determination to drill for oil in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and said, ``People shouldn't be shocked that I'm picking somebody who agrees with me. That's what a president does.'' But he stopped short of saying definitively that he would reverse the forest regulation wholesale, suggesting he would consult with ``governors and senators and local folks'' to determine what lands should remain off limits, and what lands should be developed. ``There's going to be some property in these giant chunks of land that we can use and not damage the environment,'' he said. ``There are some in this country that have wanted zero exploration or zero activity. And I just don't think it's in our national interest to take that approach.'' He was more definitive about his opposition to federal aid for family planning groups that promote or perform abortions abroad. One of Clinton's first acts, two days into his presidency in 1993, was to sign an executive order scuttling a Reagan-era policy that prohibited these private organizations from receiving public funds. Under a compromise reached in October to avoid a confrontation between congressional Republicans and Clinton, Congress allocated $425 million for such family planning activities _ but said it could not be spent until Feb. 15. That clears the way for Bush to return to the Reagan policy, and while he said that he had not yet thoroughly reviewed the matter, he suggested he was inclined to head in that direction. He also gave a sense of his other priorities, suggesting that in addition to education reform legislation and his tax bill, ``we may be able to move a little faster on Medicare'' reforms, including prescription drug coverage for elderly Americans. But he tacitly conceded that an overhaul of Social Security, a major subject of debate in the campaign, would take time. In discussing his approach to foreign policy, both in the formal interview and on his ranch tour, Bush again said he would not allow American military forces to engage in what he called ``nation-building'' _ converting countries to stable democracies _ because it was a distraction from their main mission. That was a critical difference with Vice President Al Gore, who repeatedly cited the experience of American forces in helping remake Japan and Germany after World War II. He said allies in Europe were ``very aware'' of his desire to gradually reduce America's presence in Kosovo and Bosnia, and said Secretary of State-designate Colin L. Powell would make it clear that Washington wanted Europe ``to be the peacekeepers.'' (In fact, the United States provides less than 20 percent of the peacekeeping forces in the Balkans.) But, Bush said, ``I don't have deadlines in mind'' and ``I honor the agreements that the president has _ that our country has made. ``It's going to take a while'' to pull back, he said. He endorsed much of Clinton's core strategy toward China, using economic engagement to promote more freedom, but he seemed unable to decide whether China posed more of a threat to the United States because of its growing military strength or its internal weaknesses. ``I'm trying to figure out if your question is a trick question,'' he said with a smile. After a digression on the chaos brought about by the Cultural Revolution, he concluded, ``To me, particularly as China develops as the military power, a chaotic China would be something that should cause great concern to people in the region and to us.'' He said he was prepared for objections from Moscow and Beijing to his plan to build a national missile defense, but he insisted it should not be seen by either capital as a threat. ``We've just got to explain why we are doing what we are doing,'' he said. ``The Chinese know and the Russians know that there will be no system developed in the immediate future or the foreseeable future, is a better word, that can conceivably intercept a multiple launch'' of missiles at the United States. ``You know that. They know that,'' he said. The system's real intent, he said, was to intercept an accidental launch of one or two nuclear weapons, or to deprive ``some nation like Iran to eventually say to us, `And we've got one aimed at Israel.''' He would not discuss what kind of incentive he might offer China or Russia to accept the system, other than decreasing the size of America's own nuclear missile fleet. And how many warheads could he eliminate from America's arsenal? ``That's what we are going to find out,'' he said.

Just after Martina Hingis put the final touches on her No. 1 ranking in November, a cell phone began to ring with the faint sound of a mosquito as she sat down for interviews. ``Hope that's not mine,'' she said before reaching into her purse and fishing out the phone. Hingis glanced at the caller's number, flashed a devilish smile and quipped, ``Just some admirer.'' In an instant, Hingis revealed some of the traits that had guided her to the No. 1 spot for the third time in four years: Given almost every situation, she possesses a quick, clever and confident return. While Hingis wasn't equipped with the lumberjack strength of her peers, and had to pile up computer points instead of major titles, she was able to hold off the powerful Lindsay Davenport, Venus Williams and Serena Williams by leaning on her stamina and savvy. To Hingis, her No. 1 ranking wasn't hollow at all. It was well-earned. To others, Venus Williams was the supreme player in women's tennis last year after she won Wimbledon, then took the U. S. Open as an encore. But what about this year? Once the first major tournament of the 2001 season begins in Melbourne on Monday with the start of the Australian Open, several questions about the women's field will be in the air: _ Has the top-seeded Hingis begun to decode the Williams sisters, both of whom she may have to defeat to reach the final? _ Can Venus Williams, visibly tense last week, cope with expectations stemming from her success last year and the record-breaking $40 million Reebok deal she recently signed? _ Will Serena Williams be motivated to play catch-up after watching her older sister capture all the attention? _ Can Davenport stealthily slip in and pick up her second Australian Open title in two years? Hingis won this championship in 1999, and it was her last major title. After a productive off-season, she will step onto this perilously fast surface with a sharper net game, a more refined strategy for defusing the top players and some early success. Hingis and her new doubles partner, Monica Seles, ended the 22-match winning streak by the Williams sisters at a tuneup event in Sydney. And Saturday, Hingis squeezed past Davenport for the singles title in Sydney. At any moment, Elena Dementieva or Kim Clijsters could pose a threat to the top names at the Australian Open, but for now, the same intrigue involving Hingis, Davenport and the Williams sisters is expected to pick up where it left off last year. The men are in much the same position. In 2000, the next wave finally came to a crest when the 24-year-old Gustavo Kuerten of Brazil ended the season embracing his mother after becoming the first South American to gain the No. 1 ranking. In the final event, the waifish Kuerten, with his wild locks cropped, completed an improbable takeover of Marat Safin of Russia with a run that included victories over Pete Sampras and Andre Agassi in the season-ending Masters Cup. To a degree, Kuerten and Safin demystified Sampras and Agassi last year. This year, some of the same issues will surface: Have Sampras and Agassi been passed by the youth movement? Can Safin and Kuerten emerge as consistent winners? Will the men develop players with the kind of star power that has given the women's game such visibility? Saturday, one low-key legend and happy newlywed was at work. On the court inside Rod Laver Arena, Sampras was spotted practicing with the vigor of a great champion not ready to fade away just yet. ``He doesn't say anything, but as a competitor, it couldn't not bother him,'' Sampras' coach, Paul Annacone, said, referring to those who believe the 29-year-old Sampras has been overtaken. ``He did well in three of four Grand Slams. But because he's so laid-back, he doesn't capture the imagination of the public as an entertainer. That's the way he wants to live his life. ``This year, he's in better shape, seems happier in his life. Otherwise, he's the same.'' Just a year older. While Sampras focuses on the majors, wanting to add to his Grand Slam legacy, the hungry young players, like Safin, Kuerten, Magnus Norman and Lleyton Hewitt, will try to use the Australian Open to jump-start their races to No. 1. It is not certain where Agassi fits in the scene. After winning the Australian Open last year, he failed to win another tournament in 2000. By the time he exited in the second round of the U. S. Open, his body had been worn down by a rugged schedule, and his spirits were threadbare after finding out his mother and sister had breast cancer. The top women are young and well-established. Over the past three years, the back-and-forth among Hingis, Davenport and the Williams sisters has provided riveting matches on the court and a fascinating clash of personalities away from it. As the season unfolded last year, it was clear that Hingis and Davenport were aligned to challenge the dominance of the Williams sisters. As invincible as Venus Williams seemed, she didn't have a realistic shot at No. 1 because she and her sister took off chunks of time because of injuries and their commitment to attend fashion design school. Until the past two weeks, neither third-seeded Venus nor sixth-seeded Serena Williams had played competitive tennis since October. If they are rusty, the chances for an Australian Open final between Hingis and the second-seeded Davenport could increase dramatically. ``I'm looking forward to this,'' Hingis said when she arrived in Australia. ``The other players have physical abilities, but I have other weapons.''

Nine years ago, then-Missouri Gov. John Ashcroft had enough support in the Legislature to pass a ban on most abortions, but young Democratic House member Ronnie White outmaneuvered him and killed the measure. The clash was the start of a contentious relationship that crested in 1999 when Ashcroft succeeded in persuading the Senate to keep White, now a Missouri Supreme Court judge, off the federal bench. Now it's White's turn. As the star witness at Ashcroft's confirmation hearing that begins Tuesday, he will help determine whether Ashcroft becomes U.S. attorney general. White was the first judicial nominee since conservative jurist Robert Bork in 1987 to suffer defeat on the floor of the U.S. Senate. Ashcroft insisted the judge was ``pro-criminal.'' Because the judge is black, critics accused Ashcroft of racism, a charge that has resurfaced since he was nominated by President-elect Bush on Dec. 22. The NAACP and other minority groups are ardently opposing his nomination. Ashcroft's allies counter that he has a lengthy record of support for minority nominees, both as governor, when Ashcroft named eight blacks to the state bench, and in the Senate, where he voted for 26 of 28 minority nominees. In 1992, while governor, Ashcroft had a promise from Democratic leaders in the Missouri Legislature to give his abortion bill a fair hearing. He had a one-vote majority on the House Criminal and Civil Justice Committee, chaired by White. But when members assembled for what was to be a no-vote work session _ and with two abortion foes absent _ White unexpectedly allowed a vote. The measure failed, 8-7, remaining dead even after White allowed a no-show to weigh in, making the vote 8-8. Ashcroft was upset, recalled state Rep. Quincy Troupe, an ally of White's from St. Louis. ``I think he was insulted that Ronnie White outsmarted him,'' Troupe said. Troupe believes Ashcroft sought revenge when White was nominated to the federal bench, but Rich McClure, Ashcroft's former chief of staff, said the senator's opposition had nothing to do with the abortion bill. ``I have no doubt that he did not even remember Judge White's handling of an abortion bill when he was considering his judgeship,'' McClure said. ``Senator Ashcroft did what was right, in his view.'' Ashcroft's objections were muted in 1997 when President Clinton nominated White to a judgeship in the Eastern District of Missouri in St. Louis, through renomination and two confirmation hearings. Then, in August 1999, after the Judiciary Committee had given White a second thumbs-up, Ashcroft turned up the heat. White was soft on crime, even ``pro-criminal,'' Ashcroft said, because the judge voted 14 times to reverse the death penalty _ more than one-quarter of the first-degree murder cases that came before him. While Ashcroft mentioned abortion during White's confirmation hearings, his reference to their Statehouse dispute was obscure. Some ``were injured by the nominee's manipulation of legislative procedures,'' Ashcroft said, and White's ``failure to be evenhanded'' contributed to Ashcroft's vote against him. The emergence of the law-and-order issue with White coincided with Ashcroft's efforts to portray his re-election challenger, Democratic Gov. Mel Carnahan, as an ineffective crime-fighter. Ashcroft's aides eventually turned up a compelling story in the case against White _ and Carnahan, who had appointed White in 1994 to the Missouri Court of Appeals and in 1995 to the state's high court. White offered the lone dissent when fellow jurists upheld the sentence of James Johnson, who had killed three law officers and a county sheriff's wife. The sheriff, Kenny Jones, dove into the controversy and circulated a petition at a Missouri Sheriffs Association convention. White's nomination ``was a slap in the face,'' Jones said in an interview. He also may testify at Ashcroft's confirmation hearing. With the sheriffs and the Missouri Federation of Police on his side, Ashcroft told his colleagues, ``When the law enforcement community raises a red flag about a judicial nomination, as they did in this case, the Senate should listen.'' In the uproar over White's defeat, new details emerged. First, it was Ashcroft who courted opposition from law enforcement groups, not the other way around. He sought help from the police federation and the larger Missouri Police Chiefs Association, which declined to get involved. Next, White's defenders did their own analysis and concluded he voted to reverse death sentences only slightly more often than his six colleagues, five of whom were appointed by Ashcroft. White had harsh words for Ashcroft on the only occasion he has discussed his scuttled appointment. In September, during the senator's re-election campaign, White said at a Missouri Bar Association forum: ``The person who led the opposition to my nomination had the most corrosive and vicious attacks for minority nominees.'' Ashcroft's campaign responded that Carnahan ``and his liberal judge'' had opened ``the shameful race-baiting phase of the Carnahan campaign.'' Carnahan died in a plane crash Oct. 16, but voters still chose him over Ashcroft. Carnahan's widow, Jean Carnahan, was appointed to fill the Senate seat.

good evening. i'm elizabeth vargas. doctors for former president ronald reagan say he is in stable condition tonight after emergency surgery to repair a broken hip. the injury resulted from a fall in his home, a very common problem among seniors. an estimated 250,000 people fracture their hips every year. mr. reagan's wife nancy has been at his side all day, except for the hour and a half he was in surgery. we begin with abc's judy muller. president reagan is said to be resting comfortably in his room at st. john's health center in santa monica after surgery this morning to repair a broken hip. although the patient is 90 years old, very healthy tissue, very strong, healthy bone, and we were very happy with the end result at this point in time. the former president, who will turn 90 next month, suffers from alzheimer's disease. he was rushed to the hospital yesterday after falling at his bel-air home. to repair the fracture in his right hip, doctors inserted a series of screws and a metal plate. but the danger is far from over. elderly hip fracture patients have a high mortality risk during recovery. you're bedridden for a period of time and sometimes blood clots form in the leg and they can sometimes break off and travel to the lung and give you a pulmonary embolism. and for patients that suffer fr a brain disease like alzheimer's, the general anesthesia and pain medications can cause problems. side effects such as confusion or disorientation may be much more prominent in people who have alzheimer's disease. and that can last for a while? that can last for periods of up to six to eight weeks. ever since the president was diagnosed with alzheimer's seven years ago, the family has fiercely protected his privacy. we're all for openness but our family life now is sacred. in recent years, the former president stopped going out in public, although he did stop to pose with a young admirer in a rare walk through a park in 1997. nancy reagan is said to be the one person the president has consistently recognized in these last years. daughter maureen reagan provided a glimpse of the family's ordeal when testifying to congress about alzheimer's last year. this disease is a thief that sneaks into the brain and robs a family of everything that is dear. by a strange coincidence, maureen reagan was in this same hospital yesterday undergoing cancer treatment for melanoma. doctors say president reagan will remain here a week to ten days before he's allowed to go home. judy muller, abc news, santa monica.

we now turn to our medical editor, dr. tim johnson, for some perspective on the former president's prognosis. tim, jt how great is his risk athe age of nearly 90? well, the risk is not from the surgery itself, but from difficulties that can arise during recovery and rehabilitation. there is approximately a 20% to 30% mortality rate in the year following hip fracture surgery in elderly patients -- obviously a significant risk. what effect could the alzheimer's have on the president's recovery and rehabilitation effort? aside from confusioalluded to in the immediate postoperative period, the long-term problems involve the ability of the patient to cooperate with rehab, and the continuing risk for imbalance and follow falling that might make matters worse. it's a significant risk also but obviously the president will get the best of care. that should help. we certainly hope so. thank you, tim, for that analysis.

I am Dave Deforest, VOA News. A strong earthquake has shaken parts of Central America and Southern Mexico leaving 63 people dead. As VOA's Greg Flakus reports from Mexico City, there was widespread damage throughout El Salvador. A landslide caused by the earthquake buried some 200 houses in a ravine West of the Salvadoran capital of San Salvador and rescue workers are digging frantically trying to unearth victims. Alex Ronderos, who works for The Los Angeles Times in San Slavador, tells VOA that there may be hundreds of dead at that site. and it's really terrible. What I saw there it's incredible. I can't believe it. Mr. Ronderos says deforestation of the hill above the settlement contributed to the disaster because there were no trees to impede the landslide. He says an old church collapsed in the city of Santana in the NorthWest part of the country, but there's still no word of injuries or deaths from that incident. Greg Flakus, VOA News, Mexico City.

Welcome to this hour of VOA News Now. I'm Tod Grosance in Washington. As you just heard in the news, a major earthquake has killed at least 63 people and injured scores in Mexico and Central America. I talked with VOA's Greg Flakus in Mexico City, who describes the extent of the damage. The worst part was in El Salvador where landslides appear to have taken most of the victims. In an area west of the capital of San Salvador there were anywhere from 200 to 400 houses buried by a landslide. But they have been pulling bodies out of there and rescue workers are working frantically with sticks and whatever else they can find to clod the dirt to find people. How densely populated are the areas? And this is quite a widespread area apparently. How densely populated? Well, San Salvador is a city that's barely densely populated especially in the outer areas around the city in these residential areas. And many times they are built... this is a mountainous country and many times these residential areas are built right below hillsides or in ravines, where they are very much susceptible. In this case I talked to a fellow in El Salvador who works for The Los Angeles Times, Alex Ronderos. He was on the scene there and he said deforestation was one of their problems. It's like a mountain now. It's totally deforested and that's the problem, that's why there was no way to, how can I say, to happen like that, to have trees like forming a barricade to prevent the dirt coming down. So once again we have a natural disaster that is to some extent also a human disaster in that building in places that are inappropriate or dangerous has contributed to the disaster. Well, I was going to ask you, the authorities, do they build these structures with possible earthquakes or disasters like this in mind? Well, the larger buildings have certainly in the cities... are built with that in mind. Engineers and architects are very much aware of the fact they are in an area that's susceptible to earthquakes. But many of the humbler homes and even some of the middle class homes are put up, sometimes they cut corners and they don't build them with enough protection and so that could be a problem. But in a case like this where you have a landslide fall down on top of the houses, there's really not much that can be done in terms of building the homes to withstand that. How equipped are the authorities in handling something like this, Greg? Well, based on my past experience in 1986 I was in El Salvador when there was an earthquake and it was a major quake in which large buildings downtown collapsed and there were hundreds of people trapped. And I saw a lot of coordinated efforts on the part of the army, the police, the Red Cross, hospitals, in fact some of the hospitals were damaged and they had to have people outside in tents to take care of them and they cooperated and worked pretty well. As I say this whole region is prone to earthquakes and so people have already ideas in mind of what they need to do. Well, as far as assistance to some of these people that are going to be homeless obviously, are they going to be capable of providing shelter for these people? Well, that's of course going to be a real challenge and the President of El Salvador, Francisco Florez has already declared a state of emergency and he is calling for international aid. And I am sure that there will be help coming in from the United States, Europe, Canada, Mexico, other countries, as has always happened in the past in situations like this. You said buildings swayed as far away as Mexico City. Did you feel anything? No, I didn't personally, but I talked to some people here in Mexico who did feel it. We were quite a ways away from the epicenter. But you know there are parts of this city where you have large buildings and where the structure underneath the ground is looser and you can feel it more if you're up in a say, tenth floor or twelfth floor of a building and it sways. You can feel it more than I would here, I am sort of on the slope of the mountain. Any aftershocks yet, Greg? I didn't hear of any from anyone there although well, there actually was I guess one, there were actually two shakes there. There was one right around the same time as the first quake, so I guess you could call that an aftershock. But typically in a situation like this you have many, many small aftershocks, some which don't register very high, but there's also the possibility that in the coming hours there could be another stronger aftershock. That often happens after earthquakes and so that can be especially dangerous because if you have rescue workers and people crawling in trying to find victims, they could themselves be put at risk if there was another quake. That's Greg Flakus. He is our VOA's Mexico City correspondent.

A major earthquake shook Central America on Saturday, unleashing a landslide that buried hundreds of houses near El Salvador's capital and killing at least 63 people across the region. About 1,200 people are believed to be missing in the buried Las Colinas neighborhood just west of San Salvador, Red Cross spokesman Carlos Lopez Medina said. Medina said that at least 61 people were killed across El Salvador but the national police estimated the death toll at near 100. The 7.6-magnitude quake centered off El Salvador's southern coast also rocked Honduras and Guatemala, where two deaths were reported. Buildings swayed in Mexico City, about 600 miles to the northwest. Salvadoran President Francisco Flores declared a national emergency and appealed for international aid to help look for buried victims and assist survivors. Hundreds of rescuers frantically ripped at the earth with sticks and bare hands to reach those buried in the middle class Las Colinas area, where a 1,500-foot landslide carried away houses, cars and trees. A distraught Arturo Magana, 25, wandered about to find his 18-year-old brother, Jaime. ``I don't know where to dig because I don't know where the house is,'' he said. ``This is terrible. I don't think we will be able to pull out any victims; everything has been buried,'' said David Lara, a rescue worker struggling at the mass of dirt and concrete with a shovel. Lopez estimated that 300 houses had been destroyed in Las Colinas. By night, 20 bodies had been recovered at Las Colinas. No survivors had yet been found. ``There is my boy! Help me! Help me!'' wailed Carmen de Marin, a 41-year-old woman weeping beside the buried ruins of her Las Colinas house. She said her 12-year-old son Jaime Ernesto Marin had stayed home to await a phone call from his father in the United States when she went out shopping shortly before the quake hit at about 11:35 a.m. In the southeastern town of San Miguel, the wall of a hospital collapsed and 25 people were known to be dead in a small village nearby. News of the damage was slowed by the fact that much of El Salvador's telephone service and electricity was knocked out by the quake for several hours. Only sketchy reports had arrived from many hard-hit areas. In Santa Ana, about 35 miles northwest of the capital, the 116-year-old El Calvario church collapsed, killing at least one employee and possibly others worshipping inside, according to the Rev. Robert Castro. The Red Cross reported that 13 people died in nearby Sosonati. Some 200 other victims were rushed to the area hospital, which authorities weren't sure was still structurally sound. The quake was centered off the Salvadoran coast, about 65 miles southwest of San Miguel, according to the U.S. Geological Survey in Denver, Colo. It took more than an hour for some San Salvador radio stations to return to the air and telephone service remained spotty at mid-afternoon. There were cracked buildings and shattered windows across the city of 500,000. Officials at San Salvador's international airport said all flights had been canceled . Most businesses in the city closed _ though in a surreal touch, acrobats and dancers from a touring circus marched through the streets past frightened people, using a loudspeaker to promote a coming performance. Police in neighboring Guatemala said a man and a 2-year-old girl were killed and three other people were injured when a pair of homes collapsed in the city of Jalpataua. Local radio stations reported the collapse of a church in Suchitepequez, in southern Guatemala. The quake set off car alarms and temporarily knocked out electricity, radio, television and cellular phone service all over Guatemala, but most service was quickly restored. Honduran officials reported cracked buildings in several cities, but there were no reports of injuries. A 1986 earthquake centered near San Salvador killed an estimated 1,500 people and injured 8,000.

Weary rescuers battled blocked roads and landslides to hunt for survivors Sunday while others prayed for the dead after an earthquake that killed more than 200 people. Body-hunting dogs, sent in from the United States and Mexico, roamed across the ruins of the Las Colinas neighborhood, buried by a landslide when the magnitude-7.6 quake hit late Saturday morning. Centered off El Salvador's southern coast, the temblor was felt from northern Panama to central Mexico _ a distance of more than 1,100 miles. ``The situation is grave,'' said Mauricio Ferrer, chief of the National Emergency Committee. The nation's main airport was closed and hundreds of roads were blocked by landslides, slowing relief. Pope John Paul II on Sunday urged international assistance for the victims. Mexico was first to send substantial help, with three planeloads. The United States was quick behind, with rescue crews and supplies. Offers of assistance came from Spain, Taiwan, Panama, even Guatemala, which itself suffered damage _ and two deaths _ in the Saturday quake. National Police and rescue groups said 150 bodies had been recovered from Las Colinas alone by midday _ but in the post-quake chaos, rescuing took precedence over accurate counting. The National Emergency Committee reported 193 dead, 350 injured and 1,000 missing nationwide _ though its toll of the dead from Las Colinas was 60 less than the number of bodies from the same area reported by the city morgue. National Police counted 234 dead nationally, 2,000 injured, 4,692 houses destroyed and 16,148 damaged. Eighty-seven churches were damaged as well _ including the ruined Our Lady of Guadalupe Church overlooking Las Colinas. ``We will need to do some crying today, and there will be time for that. But we all need to understand how lucky we have been,'' the Rev. Peter Danaher of Lindenhurt, N.J., told somber, red-eyed parishioners worshipping before the rubble of brick and stone that had been their church. The only surviving wall behind Danaher displayed a cross in a stained-glass window and an icon of the Virgin. The sound of hymns drifted a few hundred yards down the ravine to rescuers digging in Las Colinas _ and Danaher used a portable speaker to be heard over the intermittent, grinding roar of earthmovers and generators from the disaster scene below. ``I am not worried about rebuilding the church. That can be done in five months or five years, it doesn't matter,'' Danaher said. ``That is a question of brick and concrete. Ours is a question of lives and human spirit.'' Only three survivors had been recovered from Las Colinas, but hundreds of people worked without sleep to hunt for more, many using only shovels, even bare hands. ``It is very dangerous here, but we are going to keep hunting. We are going to take them out alive or dead,'' said Juan Sanchez, a Green Cross rescue worker. ``There are more than 300 houses that were destroyed, and this could continue because there could be more landslides.'' Local seismologists had recorded more than 500 aftershocks by midday Sunday _ most imperceptible but some fierce. They helped to shatter the nerves of people living beside wrecked houses. Many residents of San Salvador slept in the streets or cars overnight, tablecloths or curtains covering windows for privacy. The quake also hit hard elsewhere in this nation of 6 million. Mayor Jose Perez of Comasagua, 17 miles west of the capital, said 95 percent of the houses there were flattened or badly damaged. He said four people died, though reports Saturday had put the number at 35. In Santa Ana, about 35 miles northwest of the capital, the 116-year-old El Calvario church collapsed, killing at least one employee. The Red Cross said 13 people died in nearby Sosonati. Ten people died when a landslide buried a bus on the highway between San Salvador and Zacatecoluca to the east. The quake knocked out El Salvador's telephone service and electricity for several hours. A 1986 earthquake centered near San Salvador killed an estimated 1,500 people and injured 8,000.

The possibility of a pardon for Michael Milken, a former Wall Street financier who was convicted of securities fraud, has prompted a series of strong protests from prosecutors, financial regulators and others to the White House urging President Clinton to reject Milken's request. Among those who have opposed a pardon are Mary Jo White, the U.S. attorney in New York, whose office prosecuted Milken, and Richard H. Walker, the director of enforcement for the Securities and Exchange Commission. Both have written letters to the White House, administration officials said Sunday. The New York Times erroneously reported on Saturday that federal prosecutors and others who might have objected had not done so since the possibility of a pardon from the president was first reported in the newspaper last month. Those who have objected to granting Milken a pardon said they felt he was an especially inappropriate candidate for a pardon because he had been charged with violating orders to stay out of the securities industry as part of his original plea bargain. Walker, in his Dec. 15 letter to Beth Nolan, the White House counsel, said that Milken ``failed to live up to his commitment and duty not to re-enter the securities industry.'' He said that after his release from prison and a halfway house, Milken formed two companies to provide consulting services. ``The so-called `consulting services' proved to be exactly the kind of activities that the Commission had ordered Milken not to perform _ serving as a broker in the securities industry,'' Walker said. Walker noted that the SEC charged Milken with violating that order in at least two transactions, one a multimillion-dollar deal between Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. Ltd. and MCI Communications Corp. in 1995, the other a transaction between News Corp. and Ronald Perelman's New World Communications Group Inc. in 1994. Milken was a consultant to Murdoch and Perelman. After the SEC sued Milken on those charges, he agreed to return $47 million in fees to settle the complaint without entering a plea. In his seven-page letter to Nolan, Walker concluded, ``Milken does not merit a pardon.'' Clinton administration officials said that others had written to oppose the pardon, including Benito Romano, who was the U.S. attorney in New York at the time of Milken's prosecution, and senior officials from the Justice and Treasury Departments. On Saturday, professor David S. Ruder of the Northwestern University Law School, who is a former chairman of the SEC, telephoned Nolan and urged that the president decline to pardon Milken. Clinton had tentatively decided to pardon Milken as one of his last acts in office, one associate of the president said recently. An administration official said this weekend, however, that Clinton was weighing the views of opponents of a pardon, and that a decision would be made in a few days. Milken, who pleaded guilty to six counts of securities fraud in 1990, served nearly two years in prison, paid more than $1 billion in fines, penalties, restitution and civil settlements, and was barred from the securities business for life. He has mounted an aggressive campaign seeking a pardon, and his case had been pressed directly with Clinton by Ron Burkle, a friend of the president who has been a major Democratic fund-raiser. Walker said that Milken did not cooperate as fully with investigators as he had promised when he first agreed to plead guilty. The appeal for a pardon was made on the basis of Milken's record of charitable giving. Walker wrote to Nolan that ``Milken's well-known philanthropy is commendable. But it cannot erase his simultaneous illegal conduct _ conduct that occurred after he was convicted and after he was released from prison. Philanthropy cannot provide a license to violate the law.''

For any elderly person suffering a broken hip, the surgery to repair it and the postoperative period pose significant dangers. But for Alzheimer's patients like former President Ronald Reagan, their families and their medical teams, the combination of dementia, the healing of broken bone and the rehabilitation process can present an extraordinary challenge. Reagan, who will turn 90 on Feb. 6, fell at home and broke his right hip, or femur, on Friday. On Saturday, he underwent general anesthesia while surgeons inserted a number of pins and screws and a plate to put the various parts of the broken femur back together and make it stable enough to bear his weight. On Sunday, Reagan remained in stable but guarded condition at St. John's Health Center in Santa Monica, Calif. Joanne Drake, Reagan's chief of staff, said he began eating, needed little pain medication and was expected to sit up in the first step of his physical therapy. Then he is expected to stand and, as the days go on, walk with a walker. Reagan's doctors declined to discuss the state of his Alzheimer's disease at a news conference on Saturday. His chief orthopedic surgeon, Dr. Kevin Ehrhart, said that Reagan suffered a ``fairly run-of-the-mill hip fracture'' and that rehabilitation would be ``a long, uphill struggle,'' as is ``typical for anyone with a broken hip.'' Reagan is expected to remain in the hospital for about another week. Then he faces months of rehabilitation at home. The biggest medical challenge ahead is to help Reagan to walk unassisted again, Ehrhart said. But, he added, there is ``no guarantee that he'll get back to the level he was before this happened.'' Ehrhart did not define the degree of Reagan's earlier mobility in describing the operation as technically successful and without complication. Ehrhart also said the doctors were ``very happy with the end result at this point in time.'' The incidence of broken hips has increased as the population has become older. Falls now account for 90 percent of the estimated 350,000 fractured hips in this country each year, the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons said. Hip fractures are painful, and Reagan's was no exception. ``The key is to fix broken hips, basically for pain relief and to get the patient moving,'' said Dr. Thomas Sculco, director of orthopedics at the Hospital for Special Surgery in Manhattan. If the broken femur is not repaired, he said, the pain can keep a patient immobilized, aggravating the fracture and increasing the risk of bed sores, urinary tract infections, bowel dysfunction and additional confusion. Reagan has shown strength and resilience over the years in responding to a number of serious medical problems _ chest surgery for gunshot wounds, colon cancer, a noncancerous enlarged prostate and a deforming hand condition. But the days and weeks ahead will be a bigger challenge to Reagan than the hip surgery itself. Over the next few days, Reagan's strength and resilience will be tested further as he faces a significant risk of complications simply because of the frailties that accompany age. Of particular concern are the possibilities of heart failure, pneumonia and blood clots arising in his legs and lodging in his lungs to cause a potentially fatal pulmonary embolus. Reagan apparently has avoided the problem of a bone-weakening condition known as osteoporosis, Ehrhart said. But Reagan's Alzheimer's disease is a different matter. In 1994, Reagan disclosed that he had developed Alzheimer's, the leading cause of dementia, which affects an estimated 4 million Americans. That condition is likely to affect the physical therapy and rehabilitation that hip fracture patients need to regain the mobility they had before the accident. The long rehabilitation process that usually begins a day or so after hip repair surgery relies on a patient's ability to understand and do what he is told. The doctors and physical therapists on his team will have to tap their experience to find ways to overcome Reagan's mental deficits from Alzheimer's. In general, ``one day after surgery, the physical therapist should be in the hospital room, sitting him up and standing him,'' said Sandy Ganz, a specialist in geriatric physical therapy and director of rehabilitation at Amsterdam Nursing Home in Manhattan. Once a hip is fixed, the limiting factors are usually the ability to bear weight, cognition and pain. A common approach is to assess how complex a set of instructions an Alzheimer's patient can understand and then tailor them to his needs. If a patient is too confused by a three-step command, like put your hands on a chair, lean forward and push up, then a therapist reduces it to one step, Ganz said. In such an event, Ganz said, ``you might have to put the person forward, put their hands on the chair, and then say, stand-up.'' She also said: ``If the command does not work, you would do all those things, lean them forward a bit, put their arm on the chair, put their feet in a proper position, and then guide them to stand.'' The techniques can vary depending on the case. For example, a therapist may use a walker with front wheels to make it glide so patients can simulate normal walking. Most Alzheimer patients with repaired fractured hips usually stand and walk as an instinct. Some demented patients can say ``it hurts.'' Others let their pain be known by wincing, crying or pointing to the affected area of the body. If a patient cannot articulate he is in pain, members of the medical team look for clues like a grimace on the face. In such cases, team members will relieve the weight to determine whether the pain is from too much weight bearing or the incision. While pain relief is critical, it is also important not to overmedicate because the pain killers can suppress cough and deep breathing, which are important steps in preventing pneumonia and other serious lung problems. The team also tries to make sure that when pain medication is needed, its effect coincides with the timing of physical therapy. ``Some patients just take off and walk while others take a little more time,'' Ganz said. ``My feeling is a person should be pushed as far as they can walk until they either tell you they can't do any more, look too tired or warning signs come from monitoring of blood pressure and heart rates.'' Although Alzheimer's is incurable and a terminal disease, it may last for many years and produce a broad spectrum of illness. Many people with mild to moderate Alzheimer's who suffer hip fractures can return to their home and community if they are provided with active geriatric rehabilitation. In general, the severity of cognitive impairment correlates with higher death rates and less successful return to independent living. Reagan's rehabilitation is expected to be conducted in his home, Ehrhart said. In Reagan's case, very little is publicly known about his Alzheimer's progression and the quality of his life before the broken hip. In trying to protect her husband's privacy, Nancy Reagan has said very little about what he can do. Reagan stopped going to his Century City office in 1999. In recent months, Reagan has rarely been seen outside his home, taking fewer strolls and visits to a nearby park, suggesting that the dementing disease has advanced. Dr. Victor Frankel, an orthopedic surgeon at the Hospital for Joint Diseases in Manhattan, said that Alzheimer's patients with hip fractures needed 24-hour supervision to protect them from getting out of bed and attempting things beyond their physical capabilities. Reagan has health care workers and, unlike other Alzheimer's patients, he has Secret Service agents, who can also help keep him from wandering aimlessly from home. Frankel said that the death rate for hip fracture patients was significantly higher in the first six months after the accident but thereafter approached that of someone who did not suffer a hip fracture. Most falls leading to hip fractures occur at home, as did Reagan's. To reduce their frequency, experts advise precautions like keeping living quarters uncluttered, avoiding throw rugs and using nonskid floor wax, arranging furniture to allow a clear pathway between rooms, and placing a lamp, telephone and flashlight near the bed. Alzheimer's patients and the people who take care of them should decide about their desired intensity of care before the disease inevitably progresses and express them in living wills and directives, Dr. Don Riesenberg wrote in The Journal of the American Medical Association last July. It is not known whether Reagan has signed such orders regarding his terminal care.

A Miami-Date County emergency response team took critical supplies to El Salvador Sunday, a day after an earthquake buried thousands of homes in the Central American nation. The emergency aid, coordinated by the U.S. Agency for International Development, included 25,000 pounds of blankets, medical kits, drinking water and plastic tarps for makeshift shelters. A five-member Disaster Assistance Response Team will distribute supplies and help assess damage and needs in El Salvador. The magnitude-7.6 quake Saturday left more than 200 people dead and some 1,200 missing. ``We bring in the supplies, we coordinate with authorities there,'' U.S. AID spokesman Chris Madison said. ``People have been taken out of their homes, so what you need is water, shelter. We use plastic sheeting, you can protect people from the elements with that.'' Both the supplies and emergency team are from the Miami-Dade Urban Search and Rescue Team, a 250-member group that has responded to flooding and earthquake disasters from Mexico to Turkey to Mozambique. The specialized squad was tapped by U.S. AID last June to be the federal agency's quick-response team for countries damaged by hurricanes, earthquakes and other natural disasters. The emergency supplies were prepackaged and ready to go at Homestead Air Force Base south of Miami. Another emergency team based in Costa Rica arrived in San Salvador Saturday, Miami-Dade County Fire Rescue said. Mexico was the first country to send help. ___ On the Net: Miami-Dade Fire Rescue: http://www.co.miami-dade.fl.us./firerescue USAID: http://www.info.usaid.gov/

Monica Seles became the first player to reach the second round of the Australian Open, winning in just five minutes Monday when Brie Rippner retired after spraining her left ankle. Seles, seeded fourth, led 1-0, 0-15 when Rippner stumbled along the baseline and tumbled to the court. After receiving treatment from a trainer, Rippner decided she couldn't continue. It was a strange finish for the first match at Vodafone Arena, the new 10,000-seat stadium that gives Melbourne Park a second court with a retractable roof. Seles said footing on the new court was tricky but will likely improve as the tournament progresses. ``The court hasn't been played much on,'' she said. ``It's definitely a lot stickier than the outside courts I've been practicing on. Right now it's just like a glue.'' Seles said she felt badly for Rippner, her good friend and a fellow American. But because Seles is battling a virus and taking antibiotics, she was glad to play just 12 points. ``Now I can rest a couple more days,'' she said. ``I've got a low-grade fever, and I'm just really weak.'' Eighth-seeded Anna Kournikova also won her opening match, beating Daniela Hantuchova of Slovakia 6-2, 7-5. No. 14 Sandrine Testud eliminated Maria Antonia Sanchez Lorenzo 6-1, 6-0. U.S. Open champion Marat Safin, showing no signs of the sore elbow that bothered him in a match last week, beat Galo Blanco 6-4, 1-6, 6-4, 7-6 (5). Safin's serve improved as the match progressed, and he fired aces at up to 131 mph. ``The elbow for the moment is OK,'' Safin said. ``Hopefully I will serve like this the whole two weeks.'' Safin is seeded second. The victory was an improvement on last year's showing, when he lost in the opening round to Grant Stafford and was fined $2,000 for tanking. The U.S. Open and Australian Open men's titles have been won back to back four times in the past eight years, with Pete Sampras and Andre Agassi each achieving the feat twice. Safin said he's optimistic about his chances. ``I have enough game. I have enough power. I have everything to win Grand Slam tournaments,'' he said. Eighth-seeded Tim Henman and No. 9 Juan Carlos Ferrero also advanced. Henman beat Hicham Arazi 7-6 (5), 6-4, 6-4, and Ferrero swept Alun Jones 6-3, 7-6 (3), 6-2. Seles, a four-time Australian Open champion, won her first 33 matches in the tournament before losing to Martina Hingis in the semifinals two years ago. ``I've always liked playing here and always look forward to coming back,'' Seles said. She has a favorable draw this year, with Hingis, Venus Williams and Serena Williams all in the other half. Hingis is seeded No. 1 and bidding for her fourth Australian Open title, and Venus Williams is seeded third and trying for her third consecutive Grand Slam title. Defending champion Lindsay Davenport is seeded second.

Seles, seeded fourth, led 1-0, 0-15 when Rippner stumbled along the baseline and tumbled to the court. After receiving treatment from a trainer, Rippner decided she couldn't continue. The tournament opened with mild, sunny weather and no upsets among the early matches. Defending champion Andre Agassi, seeded sixth, sailed through the first set in 19 minutes and went on to beat Jiri Vanek 6-0, 7-5, 6-3. ``I felt like I stayed solid from start to finish,'' Agassi said. ``I've had so many good results here that it's hard for me not be confident.''

Russia's Marat Safin has no intention of curbing his emotional on-court outbursts _ even if others suggest his tantrums can give opponents a psychological edge. ``Sorry, but I was No. 1 in the world. Who wants to tell me (to change)?'' Safin said Monday after his first-round 6-4, 1-6, 6-4, 7-6 (5) victory over Galo Blanco of Spain. ``I don't understand why everybody is trying to tell me that it is bad for me,'' Safin said. ``I've been doing this since I was a kid.'' The 20-year-old Russian has earned a reputation for smashing rackets. ``How can I change my character, it is me. I'm doing well _ even breaking 50 rackets. I mean, I was No. 1 in the world for two weeks, that means something.'' After being fined $2,000 for tanking his match at last year's Australian Open, Safin went on to beat Pete Sampras in straight sets to clinch the U.S. Open and finished the year No. 2 in the ATP Champions race. He said he was disappointed to finish behind Gustavo Kuerten, but was confident he could go do better this year. ``I have enough game, I have enough power. I have everything to win a grand slam tournament,'' he said. ___ MOPING MOROCCANS: Younes el Aynaoui and Hichim Arazi gave tennis in Morocco an enormous boost last year when they both reached the quarterfinals at the Australian Open. Never before had two Moroccans advanced to the quarterfinals of the same Grand Slam. Adding to the success, Karim Alami made the third round before he was beaten. But the Moroccans have failed to repeat the unprecedented success. El Aynaoui retired Monday after aggravating a knee injury when he trailed Ivo Heuberger of Switzerland 6-2, 5-4. Arazi was ousted in straight sets by No. 8 seed Tim Henman of Britain. Alami takes on Wayne Ferreira in a first-round match Tuesday. ___ JEAN THERAPY: Defending Australian Open champion Andre Agassi travels light when he heads Down Under. After advancing to the second round on Monday with a straight sets win over Jiri Vanek of the Czech Republic, the 30-year-old Agassi said his packing method reflects the casual lifestyle in Australia. Off the court and out of the spotlight you can usually find him wearing a pair of jeans. ``I enjoy the easiness that you can really only pack a pair of jeans and make it through the whole month _ (you) can't quite do that in New York or London or Paris,'' Agassi said.

just before we go on to the other news, a quick check on president reagan after his hip surgery. he sat up in a chair today and ate some ice cream despite the burden of his alzheimer's disease, his doctors are impressed with his postoperative progress. just a few minutes ago we talked about his recovery with our medical editor, tim johnson. tim, not to minimize for a second mr. reagan's alzheimer's, but many people in the country believe that physically, he's always been as strong as an ox. so let me ask you first, if he didn't have alzheimer's, just about to be 90, what would this recovery be like? is that 'tis tickly, people at that age who have hip fractures have a high mortality rate, 20% to 30% within the first year after surgery. that's because they have two major insults, the surgery itself, which is very major and the decrease mobility, which increases the risk for infengs, blood clots, pneumonias. houv, as you point out, he has good physical stamina and i think that plus the excellent care he will obviously receive will decrease that risk for him. now add alzheimer's to the equation. that's a tough one to call because obviously at least theoretically it increases the difficulty for the patient in cooperating with the long and complicated rehabilitation. however, once again, he's going to have the best of care and a lot of assistance. and i suspect that will not turn out to be a major factor. many thanks, tim johnson. president reagan will be at santa monica hospital for ten days at least.

I am David Coler VOA News. In El Salvador authorities buried hundreds of bodies in mass graves Monday. One man was found alive after calling for help on his cellphone but officials believe thousands of others are buried under tons of rocks and mud. The official death toll now stands at six hundred but four thousand people are still listed as missing. In the town of Komasagua three thousand people were missing and feared buried under a massive landslide. Relief worker Steve Matthews of the United States says filling basic human needs is priority number one. We give them plastic sheeting and cooking utensils and then also look after their immediate food needs giving them beans and rice and so on. One of the major needs is going to be fresh water, even the water pipes in San Salvador have been cracked and broken so fresh water is hard to come by. By midday Monday 270 bodies had been retrieved from the Las Calenas neighborhood of Santa Tegla, a small town near the capital San Salvador.

This is VOA News Now coming to you from Washington. I am Tony Riggs. In Central America with the ground settling and time passing, rescuers say the chances of finding any more survivors from Saturday's earthquake are fading. Reporter Catherine Elton is in Las Colinas in Santa Tekla just South of the Salvadoran capital, arguably the community which was hardest hit by the Saturday earthquake. She accompanied a search and rescue team as they uncovered a number of bodies, but sadly she tells News Now's Tom Crosby, they found no one still alive. Today they pulled out nine bodies or only portions of bodies unfortunately and they are not finding any people alive and hope is fading very, very quickly that there're going to be anymore survivors found. The earth that's covered homes in its area in Las Colinas where there is a landslide, is quite compacted and the chance of finding someone alive is really almost impossible, although people always do have that hope. Now I understand you are with a Spanish rescue team. They came from Europe? They came from Europe, there're 75 Spaniards who came over . Some are specialized rescue teams that work with dogs, that when they are not working on earthquake scene they were in Turkey working on earthquake in Turkey, they also do Alpine rescue. And they've come here and they've come here with their dogs, a variety of different breeds of dogs and they are putting the dogs to work to sniff and to see if they can find signs of life or at least bodies to be able to hand over to family members who want to have something to bury. Now where you are of course, the search goes on, the hope of finding people alive as you say is fading. But there must be relatives and friends and others who are just shall we say hovering in the area watching, hoping and praying. That's absolutely right though I will say today that the authorities kept a lot more people off the rescue site, today was the landslide site I guess we could call it. Yesterday there were a lot more people out there today the authorities are really trying to keep people out. It's a race for time, to dig up the earth, there's dogs and there are a lot of these specialized workers and it's important that people aren't traipsing around much in the rubble. But yes, family members keep dropping by the morgue area to see if there's been bodies found that they can identify as perhaps one of their loved ones and they are hovering in nearby though like I said, hope is dwindling fast. What I did see today were some family members sifting through debris left behind in the house and personal effects, records, strips of negatives, blouses, dolls, things that they recognize and they know belong to their loved ones and packing some of it up and taking it away. But it must be a very emotionally wrenching thing for these people to go through? It is. It is really emotionally wrenching. It was incredibly moving, there is one man standing by a house where his mother and his younger sister disappeared, watching as the dogs ran over the dirt looking and he stood for a while clutching a baby doll that belonged to his sister and just sobbing. It was just too much and he's really while he said he still has little hope that they'll find them right now, he's really just being realistic and hoping that he can at least have their bodies to give them a burial. Catherine, amid the efforts to find bodies and hopefully somebody alive, there's aid I understand arriving in the country too? Yes, in the airport there is a lot of, an airport near the capital there's a lot of aid that's being flown in, medicines and there's been a call for coffins I've heard also, something that people are in desperate need of. Aid is flowing in, like I said more workers arrived on the scene. There's really been an outpouring of support and people are aware of it, the Salvadorans are highly aware of how much people are pulling together to try and fulfill the many needs that these survivors have here.

Former US President Ronald Reagan sat up in a chair and ate a dish of ice cream Monday in what his doctors called a remarkable rebound from major surgery. Mr. Reagan remains in stable condition at a hospital in Santa Monica California, two days after surgery to repair his right hip. The former President who is 89 years old broke the hip Friday in a fall at his Los Angeles area home. Mr. Reagan's Chief of Staff, Joanne Drake said doctors are impressed with his progress over the last 24 hours. Doctor Kevin Erhart told ABC television earlier Monday that Mr. Reagan needs remarkably few painkillers, but he warned that Mr. Reagan's Alzheimer's disease along with risks for pneumonia and heart failure could complicate recovery.

Thank you John, I am Tony Riggs bringing you this hour of VOA News Now. Ten years ago today President George Bush informed the American people that the Gulf War had begun. At the Pentagon, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney and General Colin Powell described the first wave of air attacks on Iraqi forces. Less than six weeks later the allies launched a four-day ground offensive that liberated Kuwait and forced Baghdad to accept strict sanctions and weapons inspections. Now one decade later, Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein remains in power presenting a challenge for incoming President George W Bush along with Vice President Cheney and Secretary of State Designate Powell. On this addition of Dateline we look at old foes and new challenges. US policy toward Iraq. here's Dave Arlington. According to veteran Iraq analyst Laurie Milroy, Saddam Hussein will be looking to get the better of George W Bush, the son of the man who claims to have vested him. Saddam is a vengeful character for whom the Gulf War never ever ended. In essence it is a rematch and Ms. Milroy says the new man in the White House must do what his father failed to, remove Saddam Hussein from power. She says step one would be to arm Iraqi opposition groups. The idea would be to replicate what the Kurds did in the North after the Gulf War. They liberated their territory, to do that in the rest of Iraq, perhaps protected by no fly zones or even the support of the US Air Force, obliterate that territory from the outside so Saddam becomes nothing but the Mayor of Baghdad and then the regime collapses. News reports say President Clinton last week approved a plan to have the Iraqi opposition distribute humanitarian aid and propaganda within Northern Iraq. But he has never fully implemented the so called Iraq Liberation Act passed by Congress in 1998, which authorized 97 million dollars in arms and military training for Iraqi rebels. Judith Kipper a Middle East expert associated with the Council on Foreign Relations and the Senate for Strategic and International Studies, says the act consists more of words than action. She says the opposition groups should be supported because they represent a different vision of Iraq's future. But in her view they do not have enough cohesion to mount any kind of effective military campaign. It's nice to talk about it, people get grand ideas, big illusions sitting in Washington DC but what is possible to do on the ground is quite different. But what some leading Republicans say implementation of the Iraq Liberation Act means, is military support for these rebel groups. Well so far nobody's given them any military support and I can't imagine that the next administration's going to do it either because there's no one to give it to. Judith Kipper advises the incoming administration to assess whether UN sanctions still provide the best way for containing Iraq militarily as support for the sanctions dwindles even among US allies. For some of the other countries that would like to do business in Iraq, who Iraq owes huge debts to, some of the UN Security Council members and who have a different view that sanctions haven't worked, ten years is enough and so it's time to end them. There are genuine differences among the countries even though the United States may want to continue sanctions, if its partners in the UN Security Council are not willing to do that there has to be an accommodation. Secretary of State designate Colin Powell says he wants to reenergize the sanctions and analyst Charles Dopher says it may be possible to get US allies and the Security Council to focus on the long term threat from Iraq instead of short term gains they may derive from an easing of sanctions. Mr. Dopher served for seven years as the second in command at the UN Special Commission on Iraq. He told me that the incoming Bush administration maybe much more forceful in dealing with Iraq and with US allies. You know the United States has worked largely with allies on the Iraq question largely through the Security Council. Many of these members of the Security Council have argued that the current regime is inevitable, that it is only a matter of pragmatism which causes them to have to work with them. The incoming administration is going to have to decide whether that in fact is the best that can be achieved. Bear in mind you know this regime has a track record, which is abominable. They've invaded countries, they treat their own population with no respect, they've used weapons of mass destruction against their own population. Do you want and can you accept over the long term this type of decision making apparatus over weapons of mass destruction, conventional forces and a significant portion of the world's oil market? We deploy a lot of forces in the region, we keep this regime contained within limits militarily and that costs us lot of money, I think a lot of our allies are getting a free ride here. Are we going to allow them to say that in effect this regime is legitimate and bear in mind they have a stake in preserving the current regime under the current circumstances and they're making money off it, the current regime. I am not in a position to understand fully the types of military commitments which would be required to replace it militarily but I think that's certainly something which has to be more fully explored. Hopefully other options can become more tenable but it's going to require a stronger commitment on the part of some of our friends and allies to participate. So would you say one big change from ten years ago is that there is no Gulf War coalition? I certainly think that the coalition which was formed to expel Iraq from Kuwait has disintegrated. The unifying principle there was very clear, it's much more difficult to get a coalition built around a potential risk. You say that Saddam Hussein has military and economic aims that would give Iraq weapons of mass destruction and dominance within OPEC, how far along is he? Well, I think he's pretty far along in the weapons of mass destruction. He has the capability, he has a pool of scientists and engineers who have demonstrated they can build these weapons. When we were operating we were not able to account for all of them, he's had now two years to reconstitute these efforts in an even stronger way. From their perspective they look at weapons and oil and economic tools, all as part of a continuance of power and influence. Their objective I believe is to displace the Saudis as sort of a key member of OPEC. You say that the attempt by the Security Council to disarm Iraq of its weapons of mass destruction was doomed from the beginning. Why do you say that? I make a comparison with the disarmament vision of the treaty after the First World War where the Allies had very stringent disarmament provisions which would be enforced on Germany. And what was found then and what was found I think in the case of Iraq is that you're asking the country to get rid of something which its leadership thinks is absolutely vital to its national security and yet you're empowering an international body with only basically cameras and pencils. And so while even in the case of Iraq there were stringent economic sanctions imposed on them, still they were willing to pay a very large price to conceal weapons and we were given no authority other than the backing of a very loose coalition, to enforce that. Basically what the Iraqis were saying is there're limits to what you can do because you, meaning the coalition, didn't occupy Iraq and they're quite right about that. Tariq Aziz would look at us and me in particular and say you're not the McArthur, you can't expect us to do all these things. Until last April Charles Dopher was Deputy Chairman of UNSCOM, the UN Special Commission on Iraq. A review of US policy toward Iraq may have to be put on hold if the situation between Israel and the Palestinians becomes even more unstable. And even there Saddam Hussein may play a role. He's been asking Iraqis to come forward to prepare for a holy war against Israel and claims more than six and a half million volunteers. As the Iraqi leader champions the Palestinian cause, Charles Dopher says he may also make it harder for the United States to find support in the Arab world. But another analyst says Iraq threatens the United States more directly. In her new book titled 'Study Of Revenge, Saddam Hussein's Unfinished War Against America', Laurie Milroy says the United States and its Allies are ignoring evidence that the Iraqi leader was behind the 1993 bombing of New York's World Trade Center and other terrorist attacks attempted against US interests. They don't see that Iraq is working with Muslim extremists including Osama Bin Laden. They don't understand that Bin Laden alone did not carry out the major acts of terrorism that are ascribed to him, most recently the bombing of the USS Cole. And until Iraq is punished for that terrorism it will continue. In her eyes the risk posed by Iraq grows day by day and year by year and now it is a risk that must be counted by a second US President named George Bush. For Dateline, I am Dave Arlington.

President Clinton, who came of age during the height of the nation's civil rights struggles in the 1960s, marked Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday underscoring his own dream that racial and ethnic divides in America will someday disappear. ``Part of Martin Luther King's dream was that somehow we would learn to `work together, pray together, struggle together, go to jail together, stand up for freedom together,''' Clinton said, quoting the civil rights leader who was assassinated in 1968. ``If I could leave America with one wish as I depart office, it would be that we become more the `One America' that we know we ought to be.'' Clinton marked the King holiday with a speech to about 900 people at the University of the District of Columbia. President-elect Bush spoke at a Houston elementary school where he promised blacks that he would ``listen not only to the successful, but also to the suffering.'' Clinton likened efforts to unite the nation's diverse citizens to life itself. ``It's a journey, not a destination, and the main thing will always be whether we're still taking the trip,'' he said. Clinton also referred to a message he sent to Congress over the weekend that calls for improving the criminal justice system, restoring voting rights for people who complete their prison sentences and better educating American Indians. In the message, he also said Election Day should be declared a national holiday and called for a national election commission, led by former Presidents Ford and Carter, that would review balloting problems that surfaced in the November presidential election. Earlier in the day, Clinton, who signed the King Holiday and Service Act in 1994, establishing the day as a national day of service, went to a local senior center where he painted a pillar and told reporters that he hoped his successor's commitment to civil rights is not marked by partisanship. Minority citizens in America still face problems that must be addressed by the next administration, Clinton said as he rolled pumpkin-colored paint with AmeriCorps workers at the Greenleaf Senior Center. ``I hope it will be a commitment that goes way beyond party,'' Clinton said. The president also told reporters that he's considering clemency for several people who have completed their sentences and want their voting rights restored. He urged Congress to pass legislation similar to that in Arkansas that automatically restores voting rights after people have served their sentences. ``It would seem to me most American people agree that when you pay your debt to society and become law-abiding citizens,'' that voting rights should be restored, he said. ``I would really like to see it done. I think there's a lot of bipartisan interest in it.'' On Sunday, Clinton sent Congress his recommendations for improving race relations in the United States. In his message to lawmakers, Clinton called for an end to the ``intolerable practice'' of racial profiling. He also pressed Congress to act on a wide range of social issues, including raising the minimum wage, making more child care available and improving health care for working parents. Clinton also said Americans have an obligation to ensure that the death penalty is fairly administered. He said Congress should pass and Bush should sign legislation giving death-row prisoners greater access to DNA testing and to make sure they're represented by competent lawyers.

Muhammad Khaled Mihraban, a polite, soft-spoken 26-year-old Pakistani, thinks he has already killed at least 100 people. Maybe more; he isn't really sure. ``My goal was not to kill,'' he said. ``But I had a line to follow, an Islamic ideal. I knew that Muslims needed their own country, a real Islamic country.'' Mihraban found that country when he came to Afghanistan in 1992. Having decided ``to consecrate my life to jihad'' while studying Islamic law at Punjab University in Lahore, he said, he joined a Pakistani militant group that was fighting India in the disputed province of Kashmir. His training took place in Afghanistan. Mihraban, who was captured by the rebels fighting the Taliban in northern Afghanistan, said in an interview in a bleak prison that if he were released, he would ``stay right here and fight again for Kabul.'' If he were asked to do so, he said, he would go to London, Paris or New York and blow up women and children for Islam. ``Yes, I would do it,'' he said quietly, without hesitation. If the international terrorism that has haunted Americans for the past decade has a home, it is Afghanistan, the place that comes closest to the extremists' ideal of a state ruled by the strict code of Islamic law. Afghanistan is an inspiration, an essential base of operations, a reservoir of potential suicide bombers and a battle front where crucial ties are forged. It is also, U.S. officials say, a place where Osama bin Laden is experimenting with chemical weapons. Participants in nearly every plot against the United States and its allies over the past decade have learned the arts of war and explosives in Afghan camps, authorities say, including the defendants in the 1998 bombings of two U.S. Embassies in East Africa. The Central Intelligence Agency estimates that as many as 50,000 to 70,000 militants from 55 countries have trained here in recent years. The agency says the Taliban permit a wide range of groups to operate in Afghan territory, from the Pakistani militants who trained Mihraban to bin Laden's organization Al Qaeda (Arabic for The Base). Middle Eastern officials said that as many as 5,000 recruits have passed through bin Laden's camps. (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) ``The role of Afghanistan is now absolutely clear,'' said Michael A. Sheehan, the former coordinator of the State Department's Office of Counterterrorism, who in late December became assistant secretary-general for peacekeeping operations for the United Nations. ``Every Islamic militant we've looked at goes scurrying back there for sanctuary. Afghanistan, and to a lesser extent Iran, are the only major sanctuaries left.'' (END OPTIONAL TRIM) At the urging of the United States and Russia, which also sees a threat from Afghan training camps, the United Nations recently imposed the harshest economic sanctions on Afghanistan to press the Taliban not only to evict bin Laden and his senior entourage, but also to close down all the militant camps to foreigners. The Taliban, or ``students of Islam,'' who rule all but a sliver of Afghanistan, deny that they harbor terrorists or those who train them. Wakil Ahmad Mutawakil, the Taliban foreign minister, said the pressure to expel bin Laden was both ``insulting and useless.'' Mutawakil denied in an interview in November that bin Laden was financing the Taliban, saying the Saudi exile had become a ``very poor man.'' Bin Laden, he said, could not possibly be planning terrorist operations since his activities are ``closely supervised by Afghan guards.'' (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) The Afghan cause has inspired several generations of young men determined to wage holy war. Thousands came here in the 1980s to fight the Soviet forces in response to a fatwa, or religious order, from leading Islamic scholars. Thousands more have come since then to help the Taliban expand their power, or to be trained for jihads elsewhere. (END OPTIONAL TRIM) Taliban officials boast that they have imposed true Islamic rule, cleansing Afghan society of Western influence. Since their capture of Kabul in 1996, they have among other things banned education for girls and most work for women, and instituted harsh punishments for blasphemy, playing cards, watching television, listening to music and trimming one's beard. Bin Laden arrived in Afghanistan in 1996 after he was expelled from Sudan. U.S. officials and Afghan opponents of the Taliban say their loyalty to him has been well earned. One diplomat estimated that he had put up $40 million to rebuild roads destroyed in the war against the Soviets and the ensuing civil war. Bin Laden is also said to be providing the regime with military help. Ahmed Shah Massoud, commander of a group of rebels in northern Afghanistan, said in an interview at his headquarters that he was fighting a unit of soldiers specially trained by bin Laden, the 55th Brigade, which includes some 700 Arabs and other militant Muslims. Massoud said he had captured brigade members, whom he called the most seasoned fighters. Massoud said his soldiers were holding some 1,200 Taliban prisoners, 122 of them foreign Muslims. There are Pakistanis, an immigrant to Pakistan from the Burmese province of Arakan, Yemenis, Britons and Chinese Uigurs, among others. (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) The goal of returning home to continue the jihad is common among the prisoners. Julie Sirrs, a former Defense Intelligence Agency analyst who has interviewed many of the non-Afghan prisoners held by Massoud, said nearly half belonged to groups that the State Department has designated as terrorist. (END OPTIONAL TRIM) U.S. officials acknowledge that they have limited influence over the Taliban, who they say have a powerful regional ally in Pakistan. Pakistan denies that it has sent soldiers to fight alongside the Taliban. But diplomats, relief workers and Afghans interviewed in Kabul and Jalalabad insist that Pakistan has provided not only weapons, logistical and other assistance, but soldiers as well. There are also suggestions that Pakistani authorities have pressed students to fight for the Taliban. One relief worker who visited the Indira Gandhi Children's Hospital in Kabul in late June said that all of its 400 beds were filled by Pakistanis wounded at the front, some as young as 15. Several patients said that they had been sent to fight by their religious academies, many of which closed for the summer battle season, leaving impoverished students with no place else to go. U.S. officials say they have little leverage over Pakistan. The United States cut off military aid in 1990 after the Pakistanis detonated a nuclear bomb. With no ally in the region to help, the Clinton administration has mounted a wide-ranging diplomatic campaign to isolate the Taliban militia from the world community. The effort bore fruit late last year when the United Nations, prodded by the United States and Russia, expanded economic sanctions on Afghanistan _ a change that will take effect on Jan. 19. In late December, Clinton's top national security advisers gathered in Washington to consider the next step against the Taliban, including possible military action. Several officials at the meeting opposed military action on the ground that it would achieve little and would make Americans the targets of further terrorist attacks. And officials said a military strike could even be counterproductive, enhancing bin Laden's public standing among militants. ``Making him a hero is the last thing we want to do,'' said one senior U.S. official.

Gunfire broke out Tuesday afternoon around the home of embattled Congolese President Laurent Kabila, who has been fighting multiple rebel armies for more than two years, witnesses said. Presidential aide Eddy Kapend went on national television shortly after the shooting ended to appeal for calm, but he made no mention of the incident. Kapend ordered all airports and borders closed, but gave no other details. It was not immediately clear if anyone was injured or killed in the shooting, which apparently lasted for less than an hour.

Congolese President Laurent Kabila was shot during an attempted coup d'etat on Tuesday, a senior military official in neighboring Republic of Congo said. It remained unclear whether Kabila had been killed during an intense 30-minute gunbattle at his palatial residence in the capital. Intelligence officials in Rwanda, which supports rebels battling Kabila's government, said they had unconfirmed reports that Kabila was dead. The Republic of Congo official, who spoke on condition of anonymity from his country's capital of Brazzaville, said Kabila was shot and that it was not known who was in control of Congo's government. Shortly after the gunfire erupted, Kabila aide Eddy Kapend went on national television to appeal for calm. Kapend ordered all airports and borders closed, but gave no other details and made no mention of the violence. Later, a presidential helicopter landed at Kinshasa's main hospital, a government official who witnessed the event said, and there were unconfirmed reports that the aircraft was carrying Kabila's son Joseph Kabila, who had apparently been injured. Hours after the apparent coup broke out, truckloads of armed soldiers patrolled the streets in the capital city of the vast Central African nation. Kinshasa residents hurried home, and many streets were quickly deserted. Kabila's hilltop residence near downtown Kinshasa, known as the Marble Palace, is usually heavily guarded by soldiers and a North Korean-made tank. The Congolese president has been fighting a civil war since August 1998, when rebel forces backed by Kabila's former allies, Rwanda and Uganda, turned against him. In the war's early stages, the rebels reached the outskirts of Kinshasa before being turned back by Kabila's army, which is now supported by Angola, Namibia and Zimbabwe. Kabila came to power in May 1997 following a Uganda- and Rwanda-sponsored rebellion against former dictator Mobutu Sese Seko, who ruled the nation then called Zaire. The world community initially welcomed Kabila, who many hoped would be a vast improvement over Mobutu's decades-long rule, which left his nation desperately broke and with an infrastructure that barely functioned. But Kabila quickly alienated himself, inviting close friends and relatives into the government, angering investors and obstructing a United Nations investigation of reports that his rebel army had slaughtered thousands of Hutu refugees. Kabila's government signed a peace agreement last year with the rebel movements, though fighting has continued and each side has consistently accused the other of violations.

The recent history of the Democratic Republic of Congo has been one of brutality, corruption and chaos. Today there was more of the same. The Belgian foreign ministry says that according to reliable sources, President Loron Kabila has been shot dead by his personal bodyguard. Officials in the Central African nation have ordered the army to close land, sea and air routes into the capital, Kinshasa. Reuters' correspondent Tom Schimago in Kinshasa says that a helicopter was seen arriving at Kabila's presidential residence, but he is reluctant to reach any conclusions about what the copter was doing there. I spoke to one person who did see a helicopter landing in the surrounding. As he said surroundings of the presidential residence, but I can't confirm whether they were taking him to hospital or what. What do we know about the shooting that happened in the area? It was said to last about 30 minutes. Do we know if Kabila was the target and who was behind the firing? No, unfortunately that also is very confusing. We don't know anything at all about who is involved in that. But we keep having conflicting reports that he was shot at. One report say that he was shot at and... but not killed. The other reports, other rumors are actually difficult to confirm are saying that he might have been killed. Okay, Tom can you tell me at this point, do we know who is in control of the city? While at the moment it is difficult to say who is in control. Earlier on, you know, the whole thing here started with a statement on television by Kabila's military aide, Colonel A.D. Copten, who was advising military commanders to keep their troops calm, to authorize no shooting and also to the civilian authorities to keep the population calm and not panicky. But the only official thing that we know and at the 8 o'clock evening news on State television there was another statement by interior minister Guy Tanka Coogi saying that a security meeting has just been held, which he himself presided over and telling the population that Kabila has decided... Kabila has decided to impose a general alert of all combative troops over the capital and that a curfew has been imposed. An eight to dawn curfew has been imposed all throughout the capital. But he said Kabila asked the population to stay calm and to go about their business. Are people abiding by that curfew? Now if you look outside is there anyone on the street now? There are still people on the street because, you know, when the news got to be known, people started rushing home and there were not enough vehicles to take people home so they... you can see around the... all throughout the city streams of people along streets walking to... rushing rather to their homes. One of the reasons the United States and others have been concerned with what is happening there in Congo is that a conflict involves more than just the country. It involves much of Central Africa and that is pretty frightening because Congo as you know is very wealthy in natural resources and there are lot of neighbors who are ready to pounce in some kind of a power vacuum. I imagine that is a concern of many people there as well. Yes, it is especially among the intellectuals, you know. They are pretty scared of what might come and because the future is really unsure here. We don't know where we are moving and it is difficult to say whether the peace process is going to hold for long. So you really have a sense of desperation here among most of the population. And what is clear is that the people are really tired, tired and sick of the war and that they want peace. Tom Schimago reporting for Reuter, speaking to us from Kinshasa, Congo. Thank you very much Tom for the update. You're welcome.

A flurry of reports from Congo Tuesday said that President Laurent Kabila, who deposed one of Africa's great dictators but then brought his country into even worse disarray, was shot and apparently killed. According to an American who works for Kabila and the foreign minister of Belgium, the Congo's former colonial ruler, the president had been shot by one of his bodyguards. The official in Brussels, Louis Michel, said he had received confirmation of Kabila's death from ``two trustworthy sources.'' The circumstances of the shooting were not immediately known, but one report said that it had involved a dispute between Kabila and some of his generals. The Congolese government gave no details of the incident, but announced that it had sealed the country's borders, closed the airport and imposed a nighttime curfew. A televised address by Kabila's personal chief of staff, Col. Edy Kapend, suggested the seriousness of the events. Soldiers surrounded the presidential palace, according to reports from Kinshasa, but the capital itself appeared calm. Ordering senior commanders to bring their units under control, Kapend said: ``No shots may be fired, for whatever reason, without prior order. The population must not be thrown into panic and the troops must not grow agitated.'' The government's minister of interior, Gaetan Kakudji, one of Kabila's closest allies, went on state television to say that the president himself had ordered the curfew, suggesting that he was still alive. But in Washington, a senior administration official said the United States has received several reports from credible sources that Kabila had been assassinated. ``Our operating assumption is that he is dead,'' the official said. If the assumption is confirmed, Kabila's death would dramatically alter the dynamics of a 2 1/2 year old war that has drawn in half a dozen African nations and destabilized all of Central Africa. Kabila, who deposed the longtime dictator Mobutu Sese Seko in 1997, had long been considered the main obstacle to any diplomatic resolution to the current conflict, and had become increasingly isolated diplomatically during his four years in office. It was not clear Tuesday night who might have led the coup against Kabila, though his standing in the military had fallen recently. After months of a military stalemate, during which all the warring parties had seemed satisfied with carving up the Congo and feasting on its natural resources, Kabila's forces suffered a serious defeat late last year in the southeast, in the mineral-rich province of Katanga. Shots were heard Tuesday afternoon near the presidential palace, where fighting also appeared to have occurred, according to the United Nations in New York, citing Kamel Morjane, the U.N.'s special envoy to Congo who is in Kinshasa, the Congolese capital. Among residents of the capital, Kabila had steadily lost popularity since toppling Mobutu four years ago. He had assumed the practice of traveling only at night, because pedestrians in daytime would lift their shirts to reveal their bellies at his passing motorcade _ as a sign that they were hungry. And yet Kabila had made no effort to end the crippling war, which has displaced up to 2 million people inside the country and pushed out a quarter of a million more into neighboring countries. In fact, he appeared to do whatever he could to disrupt any possible diplomatic progress. After a peace accord was signed 18 months ago, Kabila ignored its contents. At every turn, he blocked the United Nations from even beginning the process of deploying troops in the Congo. The United Nations, which currently has about 500 civilian and military officials in the Congo, has been authorized to deploy 5,000 peacekeepers. But it has not done so mainly because of Kabila. Susan E. Rice, the U.S. assistant secretary of state for African affairs, said Kabila's death, if confirmed, would create ``a significant change in the landscape.'' The United States will soon warn Congo's neighbors not to try to profit from the death of Kabila, she said. ``We would urge all belligerents not to try to take advantage of this to further their own interests,'' Rice said in an interview . She pressed rebels and their foreign allies to ``work collectively to be a part of the solution that advances democracy and stability in Congo and in the region.'' Two of America's closest African allies, Rwanda and Uganda, chose Kabila, an obscure rebel and criminal, to head a rebellion against Mobutu. The two smaller countries had suffered from the insecurity created by a weakening Congo, especially in its eastern region, away from the capital. The Tutsi-led government of Rwanda, especially, wanted to eliminate the presence of hardcore Hutu-militias who had taken a leading role in the 1994 Rwandan genocide and were hiding in eastern Congo. But soon after Kabila came to power, he turned against his former patrons, who were greatly resented in the Congo. Almost as quickly, the Rwandans and Ugandans backed another rebellion, this time to oust Kabila, in August 1998. The conflict soon drew in Angola, Zimbabwe and Namibia on Kabila's side, each of those countries plunging into the war in the Congo for its own specific reasons. Over the last 2 1/2 years, though, the overriding reason for their presence in the Congo was clearly to loot its resources. Angolan and Zimbabwean officers were rewarded with diamonds for their support. Meanwhile, in the territories that Rwanda and Uganda controlled, they mined for diamonds and grabbed Congo's timber. In the northern diamond center of Kisangani, Rwandans and Ugandans even fought against each other for control over the mineral resources, killing hundreds of ordinary Congolese in the process. In Kinshasa, Kabila ruled in an even harsher way than the dictator from whom he said he had freed the Congolese. Unlike Mobutu, who had skillfully co-opted his political opponents, Kabila simply ignored the quiet ones and clamped down on the troublemakers _ thereby also creating adversaries at home. According to the peace accord signed 18 months ago, Kabila was supposed to meet with other Congolese leaders in a sort of national conference, but he never bothered to conceal his lack of interest. He even closed down the Kinshasa office of the man who had been appointed to serve as a mediator, Ketumile Masire, a former president of Botswana. Kabila, who spent three decades in the bush as a small-time guerrilla fighter and criminal, never showed any real interest in negotiations. But ever the survivor, he had always proven adept at finding military allies, including the unlikeliest ones. When the Rwandan Tutsis supported him, he helped them massacre Hutus hiding in eastern Congo, including the Interahamwe Hutus who organized the 1994 genocide. After the Rwandan Tutsis turned against him, Kabila in turn backed the Interahamwe Hutus. After months of military inactivity _ with the peace accord still in effect, on paper _ Kabila turned again to a military solution last October. His troops launched an initially successful attack on Rwandan-held territory in southeastern Congo, but were eventually pushed back and ended up with a net loss. In recent weeks, both sides were said to be preparing for another battle.

The State Department announced Tuesday a reward of up to $5 million for information that leads to the arrest or conviction of people responsible for last October's attack on the USS Cole. Spokesman Richard Boucher said information about the reward will be disseminated in Yemen, elsewhere in the Middle East and in other areas as needed. The Oct. 12 attack on the Cole killed 17 U.S. sailors and wounded 30 others.

President Laurent Kabila was shot during an attempted coup on Tuesday, senior Congo officials said, and the Belgian government reported that the embattled leader was dead. Belgian Foreign Ministry spokesman Koen Vervaeke said from Brussels that ``two sources, of whom we are 100 percent certain'' said Kabila had been killed during the intense 30-minute shooting at his palatial residence in the capital. ``He has probably been shot by one of his guards,'' he said. The Belgian officials gave no further information, and the report could not be confirmed in Kinshasa. Belgium is Congo's former colonial ruler. Asked about the report, Interior Minister Gaetan Kakudji said: ``The Belgian Minister of Foreign Affairs can say what he wants but I will make my announcement tomorrow.'' A member of Kabila's security entourage said on condition of anonymity that the bodyguard had shot the president in the back and right leg. He maintained that Kabila was alive and was being treated by doctors. French diplomats in Paris also said they believed Kabila had been shot but was alive. Intelligence officers in Rwanda said they had unconfirmed reports that Kabila was killed in the intense shooting at the presidential palace, which lasted half an hour. Rwanda supports rebels fighting to topple the Congolese strongman. Kabila's government, in earlier statements, would not be publicly drawn on their president's condition, or even whether he'd been shot. ``President Kabila is alive and everything is OK,'' said Congolese Gen. Francois Olenga. The conflicting reports came hours after witnesses told of 30 minutes of gunfire around the home of Kabila, who has been fighting multiple rebel armies for more than two years. It was unclear who was responsible for the shooting. A presidential helicopter landed at Kinshasa's main hospital, a government official who witnessed the event said, adding there were unconfirmed reports that the aircraft was carrying Kabila's son, Joseph Kabila, who had apparently been injured. The younger Kabila is the head of Congo's military. Presidential aide Eddy Kapend went on national television shortly after the gunfire ended to appeal for calm, but he made no mention of the incident. The bleary-eyed Kapend ordered that all airports and borders be closed, appealing to the armed forces and civil society leaders to help maintain order. ``The Congolese people need your serenity and your discipline,'' he said. Later, an 8 p.m. to 6 a.m. curfew was announced by Kakudji as having being ordered by Kabila himself. Kakudji also put all fighting units in Kinshasa on alert until further notice. In the neighboring Republic of Congo, a senior military official said it was unclear who was in control of the Kinshasa government after Kabila was wounded. The official declined to be named. Amid the confusion of the shooting, Kinshasa residents hurried home and many streets were quickly deserted. Truckloads of armed soldiers patrolled the streets in the capital city of the vast Central African nation. Large numbers of troops in armored vehicles and on foot blocked off roads near Kabila's hilltop residence not far from downtown Kinshasa. The presidential residence, known as the Marble Palace, is usually heavily guarded by troops and a North Korean-made tank. As darkness fell, a tense calm enveloped the capital. Kabila has been fighting a civil war since August 1998, when rebel forces backed by Kabila's former allies, Rwanda and Uganda, turned against him. In the war's early stages, the rebels reached the outskirts of Kinshasa before being turned back by Kabila's army, which is now supported by Angola, Namibia and Zimbabwe. Speaking from Brussels, Kin-Kiey Mulumba, a spokesman for one of the main rebel movements insisted Kabila was dead. ``It was a palace coup. Soldiers from Kabila's escort fired at him. He took bullets directly. Immediately, the doctors took him to the main hospital, but he died.'' Mulumba said the shooting proved that the Congolese people wanted a change, but denied that rebels had anything to do with it. ``Something big happened in our country this afternoon. People want change,'' he said. Kabila came to power in May 1997 following a Uganda- and Rwanda-sponsored rebellion against former dictator Mobutu Sese Seko, who ruled the nation then called Zaire. The world community initially welcomed Kabila, who many hoped would be a vast improvement over Mobutu's decades-long rule, which left his nation desperately broke and with an infrastructure that barely functioned. But Kabila quickly alienated himself, inviting close friends and relatives into the government, angering investors and obstructing a United Nations investigation of reports that his rebel army had slaughtered thousands of Hutu refugees. Kabila's hold over his army has grown increasingly tenuous in recent months, and last week three senior generals were arrested on suspicion of planning a revolt over soldiers' pay demands. New recruits make as little as $10 a month. Kabila's government signed a peace agreement last year with the rebel movements, though fighting has continued and each side has consistently accused the other of violations.

Former President Reagan is growing stronger daily and doctors may increase the pace of his physical therapy, his spokeswoman said Tuesday. Reagan, 89, was listed as stable at Saint John's Health Center where surgeons repaired his broke hip with a pin, plate and screws during a 65-minute operation Saturday, said Joanne Drake, the spokeswoman and chief of staff. ``He participated in physical therapy sessions yesterday morning and afternoon, sitting in a chair for over 30 minutes during each session,'' Drake said in a statement. ``His appetite has increased. ``He looks stronger each day and his doctors are considering increasing the number of physical therapy sessions,'' she said. Details of the therapy were not disclosed. Former first lady Nancy Reagan has been with her husband since he fell and broke his hip Friday afternoon at the couple's Bel-Air home. Reagan's eldest daughter Maureen Reagan has been undergoing cancer treatments for five weeks at the same hospital. Her husband Dennis Revell said she was encouraged by her father's rapid recovery. ``She's resting well this morning,'' Revell said from the John Wayne Cancer Institute at the hospital. On Monday, Revell said, his wife stood for the first time in six weeks. The 60-year-old Maureen Reagan has been hospitalized since Dec. 11 for treatment of the spread of cancer since her melanoma diagnosis four years ago. ``What encouraged her was her father's recovery. She said, 'If he can do it, I can do it.' It astounded her physical therapist,'' said Revell. ``Yesterday was a major day for her.'' More than 8,500 e-mail messages have been sent to the Reagans since Saturday, Reagan Foundation executive director Mark Burson said Tuesday. Additionally, more than 600 visitors to the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley have signed a giant get-well card to the nation's 40th chief executive. ___ On the Net: http://www.reaganfoundation.org

Madeleine Albright, much like her 10 immediate predecessors, is stepping down as secretary of state with Cuban President Fidel Castro as firmly entrenched as ever, and the prospect does not please her. ``People ask me what I'm really disappointed in,'' Albright said recently, reflecting on her four years in office. ``The Middle East is one. The other is that I didn't see a change in Cuba.'' Castro is no less discouraged about U.S. policies. During the campaign, Castro and his lieutenants complained that neither George W. Bush nor Al Gore showed any hint of a more flexible policy toward his regime. Secretary of State-designate Colin Powell offers Cubans little comfort. A decade ago, following the collapse of a number of communist regimes, some as a result of U.S. military pressure, Powell, then chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, put Cuba on a short list of hostile countries where he said change was needed. Coming from the Pentagon's top officer, some Cuban officials saw the remark as a warning. Bush said in August he has no plans to ease the Cuban embargo, in place for 38 years. ``I challenge the Castro regime to surprise the world and adopt the ways of democracy,'' he said at the time. ``Until it frees political prisoners and holds free elections and allows free speech, I will keep the current sanctions in place.'' Says Robert Zoellick, a top foreign policy adviser to Bush and the president-elect's pick to be U.S. trade representative: ``Sadly, economic ties to Cuba will not benefit the people. Today, they will just empower Castro's secret police, his army, and his chokehold on the country.'' For his part, Castro has shown no interest in reaching out to the United States. Last year, his regime erected facilities adjacent to the U.S. diplomatic mission in Havana as a permanent venue for anti-American demonstrations. To protest credit restrictions on otherwise newly unhindered U.S. food and medical sales to the island, the Cuban government turned out 800,000 demonstrators last fall _ almost 10 percent of the island's population. Nationally televised anti-American round-table discussions are another regime staple. One indicator of the Bush administration's view of Cuba will occur in July when it must decide whether to waive or enforce legislation that allows Americans to sue in U.S. courts foreign companies operating on Cuban properties that were confiscated from the Americans. Since the law was approved in 1996, President Clinton invariably has exercised his waiver authority, much to the annoyance of Cuban-American lawmakers and of the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Jesse Helms, R-N.C. a co-author of the legislation. Superficially, relations between the two countries seem frozen in time _ but that is misleading. Dan Fisk, an associate at the conservative Heritage Foundation, notes that pro-embargo forces have had to contend with a well-organized corporate campaign that persuaded Congress to ease restrictions on the sale of humanitarian necessities last year. Fisk says the campaign is just beginning. ``The long term focus is the end of restrictions on U.S. intercourse with the island,'' he says. Another new wrinkle under Clinton has been an emphasis on people-to-people contacts between Americans and Cubans. More and more Americans are visiting the island. Officials believe that such contacts are an antidote to the regime's rhetoric and could nurture pro-democracy sentiments, but many in the anti-Castro camp believe the administration may have oversold the concept. Bush is getting plenty of advice on Cuba policy. James R. Jones, who served Clinton as ambassador to Mexico and is now linked to the liberal Center for National Policy, says the embargo is ``no longer sustainable'' and should end. He also urges cooperative arrangements with Cuba on such issues as countering narcotics traffickers. Clinton generally has limited bilateral discussions to migration issues. A panel of the Council on Foreign Relations, in a recent report, said an easing of the embargo would help facilitate a transition in Cuba and reduce the possibility of turmoil in the post-Castro era. This, in turn, would lessen pressures for U.S. military intervention, the report said. ___ EDITOR'S NOTE _ George Gedda has covered foreign affairs for The Associated Press since 1968. ___ On the Net: State Department: http://www.state.gov/www/regions/wha/index.html Library of Congress country notes: http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/csquery.html

Although 682 people had already lost their lives to this weekend's earthquake, it was the 683rd death that brought the sense of tragedy home to the shocked people of El Salvador. Sergio Moreno, a 22-year-old musician who was pulled alive from the rubble after spending 31 hours entombed under cinderblocks and dirt, died late Tuesday at a hospital. His near-miraculous rescue had captured Salvadorans, providing a ray of hope amid the despair. After calling for help from beneath the rubble with a cellular phone, rescuers worked more than two days to free him. But his heart and kidneys failed shortly after he was rescued. Doctors revived him and later amputated his legs, but were unable to save him. Local television stations broke away from regular programming to report his death. Even as signs emerged that everyday life was returning after the earthquake _ lines snaked around the block at newly reopened banks in the capital _ the isolated countryside largely stood still in hunger and mourning. In Las Colinas, a neighborhood near San Salvador that was buried by a landslide, earth movers dug at the mountain of dirt and a few crews looked for bodies on Wednesday morning. But they worked more slowly, the sense of urgency gone with the hope of finding survivors. Seventeen more corpses were recovered Tuesday night, boosting the national death toll to 683. The quake also killed six people in neighboring Guatemala. More than 2,500 people were injured and nearly 45,000 others were evacuated. In many places, authorities were overwhelmed by the sheer number of bodies. Many were buried in a long pit at Santa Tecla's municipal cemetery. Marcela Pena, 31, remained at the spot where her house once stood, looking for her 14-year-old daughter Betrisia. She said she has been at the morgue and the cemetery to look for her, but hasn't found her. ``I see the bodies and I am sad,'' she said Wednesday. ``But there are too many bodies to be sad. I have grown accustomed to death.'' Many Salvadorans living in the United States began arriving on flights Wednesday after days of desperation trying to get home. In San Salvador, people waited for hours to withdraw cash at newly reopened banks, bottled water was snatched off of shelves as quickly as it could be restocked and several restaurants and businesses opened their doors offering scaled-back menus and services. Much of the countryside appeared further from recovery. In Comasagua, a city 17 miles west of the capital where more than 140 people were killed and roads were rendered impassable by landslides, hungry residents swarmed around U.S. Army helicopters bringing food, water and medicine. ``All we have is God and the helicopter that brings food,'' said housewife Fidelia Guardao. Virtually all businesses remained shut in Armenia, a working-class town of 30,000 people 25 miles from the capital where 124 people died. Truckloads of fruit began rumbling into town, allowing the outdoor central market to sell limited amounts of food. There will be no meat here for some time, however, because the local slaughterhouse collapsed in the quake, killing a watchman and a pen full of scrawny cows. Electricity has been restored, but the only water to be found came from dusty puddles in the middle of buckled streets. Jose Vallentin and nine other men from the dirt-poor neighborhood of San Antonio set out walking along the highway Tuesday in search of food and drinking water. The subsistence apple farmer had heard rumors there were large aid trucks distributing supplies outside a shantytown of squatters on a highway shoulder 10 miles away. The rumors were true, but the mammoth Red Cross truck pulled away just as the group was arriving. All the food was gone, they were told. They were given three Gatorade bottles filled with purified water. Vallentin's share was about a quarter of a bottle. When they returned home, a group of volunteers in a rusty yellow pickup was handing out plastic plates heaping with black beans and tortillas. Vallentin's wife, Rosa, had braved a two-hour line to bring him a plate of food. Vallentin walked into what was left of his home _ a mountain of smashed roofing tile flanked by two sloping brick walls. His daughter, 7-year-old Veronica, was sitting on the cardboard box that now doubles as her bed. She had trouble opening the bottle's lid. He helped her open it and watched as she took a long drink. When she finished all the water was gone. ``Today we eat,'' Vallentin said, smiling at Rosa. ``We can find something to drink tomorrow.''

Officials in the Democratic Republic of Congo are insisting that President Lauren Kabila is still alive. That's after he was shot at the presidential palace in Kinshasa yesterday. But there are numerous reports that Kabila is dead. Mark Doyle reports. Despite mounting evidence that President Kabila may be dead, the authorities in Kinshasa have continued to broadcast announcements that he is just wounded and being given medical treatment abroad. It may be that the Congo government is playing for time and trying to prevent the impression of a power vacuum. It's already named the President's son, General Joseph Kabila as the interim leader pending his father's return. Personalities aside, this drama has further destabilized the vast country torn apart by a rebel war, which has sucked in the armies of half a dozen other African states.

This is The World, a co-production of the BBC World Service, PRI and WGBH in Boston. I'm Lisa Mullins. Forty years to the day after Congolese independence leader Patrice Lo Mumba was murdered, numerous reports indicate that President Lauren Kabila has met a similar fate. But officials of the Democratic Republic of Congo insist that Kabila is still alive after being shot at the presidential palace. In a televised address to the people of Congo, Information Minister Dominic Socombi said that an assassination attempt was carried out yesterday and that Kabila was flown out of the country to get medical attention. Whether Kabila is dead or alive, the Central African nation he has lead for nearly four years, has reached another crossroads. Steven Morrison directs the Africa program at The Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. Mr. Morrison, whether or not Lauren Kabila is dead or alive, whatever his condition, he is not running the Democratic Republic of Congo and that is a cause for concern. Can you explain why? Well, his government came to power May 17th of 1997 and there were great hopes after the disastrous rule of President Mabuto that he would revitalize a state within Central Africa that had decayed to a profound degree under the plunderous regime of Mabuto. Those hopes were fairly quickly dashed and his alliance with Rwanda and Uganda, which had brought him to power, fell apart and was reversed and there was a major push in August of '98 to overthrow him that failed. The calculations that are made in this period by the Angolan government and the Zimbabwean government will be critically important. These two governments came in in August of 98 to defend and protect the Kabila government. They still have very substantial military investments inside the Congo and their governments will be very concerned that what has happened in the last day not translate into runaway chaos. And how much should that be worrying Washington at this time, maybe with the possibility of, as you said, runaway chaos or of the possibility of Congo imploding without a leader? Well, it will be a cause of concern. Congo is part of the Great Lakes region, which includes Rwanda and Burundi. This is a region that has a history of high interethnic violence against civilians. We had the most profound episode of that in April of 94 with the Rwanda genocide, which directly contributed to the end of the Mobuto regime by sending refugees and those who committed this genocide into Congolese territory. The state in Congo has decayed to a profound degree and this is just the latest episode of a long succession of very negative setbacks within Congo. Do those setbacks affect the United States at all from the West perspective? I mean how much should this be at the top of the agenda for instance of the incoming Bush administration? What are US interests there? What are our national interests? I don't believe we have strategic interests in this part of the world in the aftermath of the cold war. We have substantial interests with respect to the humanitarian mass suffering that is going on on a egregious scale within the Great Lakes region. We have a broader interest in stability within Africa in order to combat the HIV AIDS pandemic, which is centered there. And if we were able to help in restoring some coherence and viability within this part of the world it would certainly help substantially in re-stabilizing Africa. Steven Morrison is the Director of the Africa program with the Center for Strategic and International Studies speaking to us from Washington DC. Thank you very much. Thank you for the opportunity to be here today.

The official, who asked not to be further identified, tells VOA the death will be announced officially later today. The official says Mr. Kabila died Tuesday while being flown to Zimbabwe for urgent care. President Kabila was shot at the presidential palace in Kinshasa midday Tuesday by a member of his security team. The official says Mr. Kabila's body is being retrieved and that a State burial will be held Saturday in Kinshasa. Other Congolese officials Wednesday continued to deny reports that their President was dead. After a special cabinet meeting Mr. Kabila's son Joseph was named interim leader in charge of the government and armed forces. The developments come as a civil war rages on in the former Zaire involving armies from half a dozen African countries.

Even as the sharp and pointed questioning of John Ashcroft by his Senate inquisitors went on for a second day Wednesday, an array of far less confrontational confirmation hearings were also playing out all across the Senate side of Capitol Hill. There was Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York smiling at Gov. Christie Whitman of New Jersey, the designee to run the Environmental Protection Agency, as a Republican colleague, Sen. George V. Voinovich of Ohio, praised the governor for her work on children's issues. There was retired Gen. Colin L. Powell, Bush's choice for secretary of state being asked by Democrats to introduce his wife, Alma, to a round of applause. The scenes captured all the conflicting impulses in the nation's capital three days before George W. Bush's inauguration as the 43rd president, the hopes for cooperation across party lines to pass legislation on education, tax cuts and health care and the equally strong possibility of continued gridlock and sharp partisan conflict. The struggle over Ashcroft to serve in the powerful post of attorney general is only the first of many battles to come at this moment of extraordinary, down-the-middle political division in the country as each party fights to gain the upper hand. Gale Norton, Bush's selection for interior secretary, a strong proponent of property rights, is also expected to come under withering fire at her hearing on Thursday. What is at stake is not just Bush's ability to choose a Cabinet of his own ideological liking, not just the Democrats' efforts to ensure that laws they support are enforced, but the very definition and image of the competing political parties. With their sharp questioning, Democrats were putting back on the front burner the hot-button cultural issues that Bush successfully played down or muffled in the presidential campaign _like abortion, gun control and affirmative action. ``This is really about George Bush more than about John Ashcroft,'' Geoffrey Garin, a Democratic strategist, said. ``This is an experience that helps define George W. Bush as someone who chose not to pursue a moderate and consensual course as he promised to do. He had the choice to try to rise above political divisions, and instead he nominated somebody who put him right in the middle of the political divisions.'' Republicans were fighting back by trying to make Ashcroft's opponents look like unreasonable ideologues and obstructionists. Sen. Charles E. Grassley, R-Iowa, called the interest groups mobilized against Ashcroft a ``mob of extremists.'' Sen. Jon Kyl, R-Ariz, at one point turned the hearing's attention away from Ashcroft to Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass, who was asking some of the most pointed questions. For all the passion and fire, only two of Bush's 14 Cabinet nominees _ Ashcroft and Norton _ are controversial, and even they are likely to be confirmed, baring any unexpected personal disclosure. (Another Cabinet nominee, Linda Chavez, already withdrew her name for labor secretary after questions were raised about her harboring an illegal immigrant.) While there have been ugly nomination battles at the beginning of other administrations, none of them has played out in a Senate that is so finely balanced and so easily tipped by partisan and ideological winds. Many of the day's confirmation hearings were love fests, showing the possibility of good will on policy. Indeed, some optimists argued that even an unusually bitter fight over Ashcroft, an ardent social conservative, might not negate the possibility of finding a middle ground on legislation; in fact, it could even make it easier for Bush to reach beyond his conservative Republican base when it comes time to work with Congress on issues. ``He might be able to use the political capital gained in the Ashcroft fight to make compromises in the future with the Democrats,'' said Marshall Wittmann, a congressional analyst who once worked for the Christian Coalition. ``To fight periodic fights like this keeps the base happy and content.'' But Bush comes into office with little political capital to spare because of his loss of the popular vote in the election. And the question is how much these early confirmation battles will cost him. Bush campaigned for more than a year against the ways of Washington and on pledges to end once and for all ``the war-room mentality, the hostile stance, then harsh charges.'' Yet he set off the same kind of partisan fight he deplored even before he was formally sworn in. Moreover, the racial issues surfacing in Ashcroft's confirmation hearings threatened to overshadow Bush's efforts to reach out through a racially diverse Cabinet, and to expose once again the black anger over the election in Florida and the charges of that many black voters in Florida were disenfranchised. In his sharp exchange with Kyl Wednesday, Kennedy insisted that questions about Ashcroft's opposition to a school desegregation plan in Missouri and his opposition to certain voter registration efforts in largely black St. Louis could not be more essential. ``That happens to be relevant, senator,'' Kennedy told Kyl, ``because we have just gone through a national debate and discussion and focus on the question of whether minorities are going to be able to vote.'' It is not clear how much Bush and his advisers anticipated the intensity of the clash that would be set off by his nomination of Ashcroft. Bush's first choice for the job was his close friend, Marc Racicot, the governor of Montana who emerged as a high-profile defender during the five-week post-election struggle over the Florida vote count. Conservatives were unhappy with that choice, and Racicot ultimately decided he did not want the job. Only then did Bush turn to Ashcroft, a just defeated Missouri senator and long-time conservative warrior. Bush's advisers argued that Ashcroft would be a safe choice because senators grant courtesy to one of their own, and because Ashcroft had been gracious when he conceded defeat in November to Jean Carnahan, the widow of his Senate opponent. (The late Gov. Mel Carnahan, who was running against Ashcroft, was killed a few weeks before election day in a plane crash. Carnahan's name remained on the ballot, and he won. His wife was then named to the Senate seat.) Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, emphasized that point this week, saying, ``The people of America saw the true heart of John Ashcroft the way he handled the tragic death of Mel Carnahan.'' But that was to misunderstand how much this nomination would come to be the focus of all the anger remaining from the way that the 2000 election ended. ``The issue of race and civil rights are very raw because of the election, and Ashcroft's nomination just rubs salt into that already raw wound,'' said Mark Mellman, a Democratic strategist. Republicans put it differently. One of Bush's advisers said what had not been anticipated was the Democrats' decision to use this nomination as a ``political organizing tool'' to stoke the anger of their base. Rep. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, said, ``I think it has surprised them a little bit frankly that the Democrats have used race in the way that they have in this nomination.'' (END OPTIONAL TRIM) It is possible that the partisan sniping of these past few days will be short-lived and that soon Congress and Bush will be taking up their most fertile ground for compromise _ education issues. Democrats recently gave an especially warm welcome to Roderick Paige, the soon-to-be education secretary. They are also expected to easily approve Gov. Tommy G.

But, inevitably, confirmation fights this bitter add a new grudge to the long list of grievances between the parties. As he rose to Ashcroft's defense Wednesday afternoon, Sen.

On Jan. 12, a gas station clerk in Fillmore, Utah, suspected that three customers were actually members of the gang of escaped fugitives now known as ``the Texas Seven.'' The clerk scribbled down their license plate number, and the police set up roadblocks. Soon, officers pulled over a van with a matching plate. At about the same time roughly 1,300 miles away, FBI agents were watching a house in Jackson, Miss. Federal officials say two independent tipsters, seemingly credible, had reported seeing one of the fugitives, Patrick Henry Murphy, at a home that supposedly belonged to a relative. But these leads, like so many others, came up empty. The van in Utah was filled with the wrong men. The house in Mississippi was a bogus tip. By Monday, officials were chasing a report in the Texas town of Navasota, where a convenience store clerk reported seeing two of the fugitives. Again, a false trail. Five weeks after staging a carefully plotted escape from a maximum-security state prison in south Texas, the Texas Seven remain at large, seemingly everywhere, yet nowhere. The thousands of tips and unconfirmed sightings have brought little to nothing. The manhunt, which spreads into Mexico and across the nation, has grown into a massive law enforcement effort, yet officials concede that they are baffled. ``This is an incredibly difficult case,'' said John F. Clark, a chief inspector with the U.S. Marshal Service, which has assigned more than two dozen officers to the case in Texas. ``It's one unlike any I've ever seen. To this point, we're just stymied.'' Law enforcement officials believe that the escapees have eluded capture by avoiding the typical mistakes of fugitives. Usually, officials say, escapees quickly separate and turn to relatives or friends for help; eventually, officers apprehend one fugitive, who leads them to the others. But officials believe that the seven escapees may remain together. And hundreds of interviews with acquaintances have resulted in nothing. Their elusiveness has only magnified their mystique and amplified the fear that surrounds them. All seven had been convicted of violent crimes, ranging from murder and rape to child abuse and armed robbery. Since the escape, officials have charged the escapees with two armed robberies, one in Pearland, Texas, and a second on Dec. 24 at a suburban Dallas sporting goods store in which a police officer was killed. The fugitives reportedly made off with $70,000 and a cache of weapons and ammunition. The group's reputed mastermind is George Rivas, an armed robber from El Paso, whom law enforcement officials believe is maintaining discipline and coherence in the group. In the Pearland robbery, the fugitives reportedly took police scanners, walkie-talkies and other tools that might help them carry out a crime spree and avoid capture. In recent weeks, according to news reports, several relatives and acquaintances of the escapees have gone into hiding, fearing for their lives. ``We all share the fear that these seven dangerous people are going to commit further acts of violence,'' said Glen Castlebury, a spokesman for the Texas Department of Criminal Justice, which oversees the state prison system and is leading the investigation. Castlebury agreed that the apparent slowness and inability of investigators to crack the case has contributed to growing public concern. ``I know that the public is frustrated because I know they want action,'' he said. But he remained confident that the fugitives will be apprehended, saying that ultimately, they will make a mistake. (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) The scope of the investigation seems to grow every day. The main command post is in Huntsville, Texas, only a few miles from the state's death chamber. There, state and federal officials sift through investigative reports, tips and unconfirmed sightings, searching for patterns or clues. The huge media coverage has been a blessing and a curse, intensifying attention on the case but also attracting scores of false tips from pranksters and others. ``Sometimes people call in and say, `You may want to look in Montana,' '' said Clark of the Marshal Service. Other tips, though, are specific and earnest. Clark estimated that about 40 tips a week are pursued and disproved while another 40 are pursued but cannot be confirmed. In recent weeks, Clark said, investigators thought they were close, particularly when officers entered a Fort Worth apartment and brought in for questioning two people thought to be connected to the escapees. ``It looked good,'' Clark said. But it was a false lead. Meanwhile, investigators have interviewed hundreds of relatives, former criminal associates and victims, anyone connected to the fugitives. Clark said state investigators are assigned to each of the suspects, to become experts on their backgrounds and tendencies. (END OPTIONAL TRIM) Even as they pursue leads across the country, investigators say they believe the fugitives are most likely still in Texas. Customs officials stationed along the Mexico border are on heightened alert. Initially, the group was believed to be in the Dallas area, but Houston is also considered a possibility. Despite the vast, isolated stretches of Texas that are practically uninhabited, officials believe the urban sprawl of Dallas or Houston would better allow the fugitives to blend in. Art Roderick, who heads the U.S. Marshal Service's task force for apprehending fugitives, put the enormity and frustration of the search in blunt terms. ``Everybody is looking for these people,'' he said. ``And nobody is seeing anything. We've done everything that you can possibly imagine.''

After two days of confused and conflicting statements, Congolese officials confirmed Thursday that President Laurent Kabila was dead. In a televised address Thursday evening, a government spokesman said the president had died of wounds he sustained in a gun battle at the presidential palace on Tuesday. ``Congo is mourning,'' Dominique Sakombi, the communications minister, said in a statement on the government-run television. Sakombi said that Kabila had died en route to Harare, the capital of Zimbabwe, where he was being flown for medical treatment. For the last two days, Congolese officials had insisted that Kabila was alive, even while some African and Western governments were saying that he had died. Foreign officials said that Congolese officials likely held off on an official announcement of the death as they attempted to put a successor in place. South African officials said they were officially informed of Kabila's death by Congolese officials Thursday afternoon. ``What has now been confirmed is that President Kabila did die of his wounds that were inflicted a few days ago,'' Aziz Pahad, South Africa's deputy foreign minister, said in an interview on state radio. ``I think that confirms what we have strongly believed to have been the truth for a while,'' Pahad said, ``but of course protocol does not allow one to officially pronounce this until the government makes a statement.'' Zimbabwe's defense minister, Moven Mahachi, said Congolese officials were making arrangements to send Kabila's body back to Congo. ``We are waiting for directives from the Congolese,'' Mahachi said Thursday in Harare. ``They will tell us what they want to do with the body. Within two or three days, they will be able to do it.'' As reports about Kabila shifted back and forth, his eldest son, Joseph, on Wednesday assumed the role of interim leader of Congo's wobbling government. The government has been opposed by three rebel groups and two outside nations since Kabila took over in 1997. Early on Wednesday Kabila was flown to Zimbabwe, which has been an ally since August 1998 in helping to fight off the rebel threat. The Zimbabwe state news agency, Ziana, then reported that Kabila's body was being held in Harare and would be flown back to Congo for burial. ``Apparently the president died on the plane to Harare,'' Dr. Kikaya Bin Karubi, Congo's ambassador to Zimbabwe, said in an interview in Harare. Mahachi said Congolese officials made the decision to bring Kabila to Zimbabwe as the wounded president was being flown from the Congolese capital, Kinshasa. ``They actually informed us while they were flying,'' he said. ``We obviously have better medical facilities than our friends. Zimbabwe could not say, `No, don't come here.' We could not say no, when someone is in such condition.'' Little has been made public about how Kabila suffered his fatal injuries. A gun battle reportedly erupted on Tuesday between Kabila and members of his armed forces inside the presidential palace in Kinshasa. It was not clear if the battle was an attempt at a coup. Several outside officials said the fight appeared to result from an argument between the president and his generals, who seem to have grown increasingly dissatisfied with Kabila.

Dressed for success again, Venus Williams overpowered fellow American Meghann Shaughnessy 6-3, 7-6 (3) on Thursday to reach the third round of the Australian Open. Williams again wore the provocative black and blue outfit that drew international attention when unveiled in the opening round. But this time she appeared more comfortable in the ensemble, which was modified to nearly eliminate the low-cut gap in her two-piece top that caused such a stir. Shaughnessy, for the record, wore a white shirt and skirt. Another American, Amy Frazier, became the third seeded woman to exit when she was beaten by Rita Grande 6-4, 6-1. Frazier was seeded 16th. No. 7 Mary Pierce remained on course for a quarterfinal clash with Williams, beating Mariana Diaz Oliva 6-2 6-2. No. 9 Elena Dementieva, the silver medalist in the Sydney Olympics, overcame a match point in the second set to edge qualifier Andrea Glass 2-6, 7-6 (8-6), 6-3. No. 10 Amanda Coetzer, a two-time semifinalist, defeated Silvija Talaja 6-1, 6-3. No. 13 Amelie Mauresmo, the 1999 runner-up, beat Nicole Pratt 6-0, 7-5. In men's play, No. 5 Yevgeny Kafelnikov took three hours to beat Nicolas Kiefer 6-2, 3-6, 3-6, 6-3, 6-0. Kiefer won only eight points in the final set. ``Anytime you win a five-set match, it's a huge relief,'' Kafelnikov said. ``It's quite satisfying.'' Kafelnikov, the 1999 champion and runner-up last year, improved his career record in five-setters to 14-7. No. 15 Arnaud Clement eliminated Alberto Martin 6-2, 6-1, 6-1. The third-seeded Williams, who repeatedly fidgeted with her top in the first round, this time was able to focus on tennis. She was in a particularly aggressive mode, charging the net early and often, and although she blew two easy volleys to lose a service game, she also won 19 points at the net, many with smash volleys. And twice when Shaughnessy dared to attack, Williams belted passing shots that sent her opponent sprawling. Williams failed to convert a match point at 5-4, lost the next game as well and then held to force the tiebreak. She stayed back the rest of the way and closed out the win with two forehand winners and a service winner on the final three points. As the crowd applauded the victory, Williams responded with a smile, wave and single hop. She moved one step closer to her third consecutive Grand Slam title.

Unseeded and unfamiliar as partners, Martina Hingis and Monica Seles combined Thursday to oust the top seeds and defending women's doubles champions at the Australian Open. Hingis and Seles, No. 1 and No. 4 respectively in singles rankings and teaming for only the second time, overcome Rennae Stubbs and Lisa Raymond in the first round at Melbourne Park. Speaking after the 7-6 (2), 6-3 loss, Raymond said it was unfair that the two best women's teams were drawn to meet in the opener. Stubbs wasn't so diplomatic. She ripped Australian Open organizers for bungling the draw by refusing to seed the Hingis-Seles combination. ``You basically had the 2000 final out there with the exception of substituting Mary Pierce and Monica Seles,'' Stubbs said. ``For anyone to think that wasn't a ridiculous first round, they're not being honest. ``Martina's ranked No. 1 in the world, No. 2 in doubles. We're ranked 4 or 5 (in doubles), we shouldn't be playing each other first round of a Grand Slam.'' Hingis has won the Australian Open doubles title in three of the last four years, with a different partner each time. Stubbs and Raymond ended her winning stretch last year with a 6-4, 5-7, 6-4 triumph in the final. Hingis also won three successive Australian Open singles titles from 1997-99 before losing to Lindsay Davenport in 2000. Seles is a four-time Australian Open titlist. Stubbs said organizers erred by not seeding Venus and Serena Williams, the reigning Wimbledon and Olympic doubles champions. ``It's ridiculous that they're not seeded either, they've won four or five Grand Slams,'' she said. ``Just because they haven't played enough tournaments to have a ranking _ it's irrelevant. It's not like they're two great singles players that were just thrown together ... they're proven.'' Hingis admitted it was a tough draw, and she struggled initially after racing off from a second-round singles win to play the doubles match. ``We definitely proved ourselves, that we can play well,'' she said. ``So far, we're winning, but we didn't play our best ... we didn't have that much time to practice.'' The 20-year-old Swiss recently ended her doubles partnership with Russia's Anna Kournikova, but said her new combination with Seles gave her new energy. ``Someone who is so professional like Monica is always a thrill to go out there with because she's such a fighter.'' Hingis said. Hingis and Seles will meet Jennifer Capriati and Jelena Dokic in the second round. The Williams sisters advanced to a second-round meeting against Els Callens and Anne Gaelle Sidot.

when the "uss cole" was attacked last october and 17 sailors were killed, one of the sailors on board the "ussole" used his own camera to record some of the aftermath. these are pictures you have not seen before, what the terrorists did to a $1 billion ship, not to mention the country's morale. here's abc's john m wethy. most of the sailors who died were about to have lunch. a half-eaten meal still sits on the table. a few feet away, destruction is total -- the floor driven up through the ceiling, a deadly twisting of steel, daylight showing through a gaping hole in the side of the ship. we was lucky to make it through all this. seaman carl wingate, who shot this home video, remembers the moment, along with his shipmates. it was a really loud boom. i mean, it's almost undescribable how loud it was. i actually started running up the passageway, up the ladder. i opened up the door, and there was no deck there. it's gone. i felt my whole body shaking. i thought i was getting electrocuted. i didn't know what was going on. in the hours just after the blast, the crew is in a state of shock. some still covered with soot from the explosion wander through darkened passageways, still not sure what hit them. god was -- god was with me today. a senior enlisted man says he would have been killed if he had not been called to a meeting moments before the blast. there was debris laying all over. outside, the ship's exterior walls are pitted by shrapnel from the explosion. an orange life raft, blown from the deck, is plastered to the side of the bridge, like a moth on the front of a speeding car. crewmen, now at battle stations, stand at a 50-caliber machine gun that was unmanned when the attack occurred. the navy's final report on the "cole" attack is expected to explain why no one will be punished, even though the captain and crew failed to take basic steps to protect the ship. sources y the navy itself will accept part of the blame, by admitting all its ships were vulnerable and its sailors were not trained to expect this kind of attack. john m wethy, abc news, the pentagon.

Opening a summit meeting that the Congolese leader Laurent Kabila was to have attended, heads of state from across Africa spent a moment on Thursday mourning Kabila _ even as his aides back in Congo were continuing to insist that he was not dead. ``I invite you to observe a minute of silence in memory of our dear brother, Laurent Kabila,'' President Gnassingbe Eyadema of Togo, the presiding official, told delegates assembled for a two-day summit meeting of mostly French-speaking African countries. Like most of the world, the leaders gathered here in this West African capital appeared to assume that Kabila had indeed been fatally shot hours before he would have left for the meeting. Yet as they began the proceedings, what little was being said was guarded, as participants awaited Congolese confirmation that what Le Messager, the Cameroon newspaper, had on Wednesday as its headline _ ``Kabila Assassine'' _ was indeed the truth. ``Our happiness,'' Secretary-General Kofi Annan of the United Nations said in a speech, ``is tempered by the uncertainty of the fate of President Laurent Desire Kabila.'' Only later Thursday, nearly two days after the palace shooting reportedly happened, did the Congolese government announce that Kabila was in fact dead, and even then it said that he had died only Thursday after clinging to life for nearly 36 hours in a Zimbabwe hospital. Uncertainty over Kabila's situation, however, provided a surreal start to the summit. Wednesday night one arriving leader after another left his plane and marched nearly underneath a visage of the slain president, whose portrait was hanging with those of other leaders across a balcony overlooking the tarmac. But Thursday morning, as the leaders began arriving at the conference center, Kabila was missing from a similar row of portraits inside the entrance. His absence, Annan said, would be felt as the summit participants took up globalization, this year's theme. Although the war-retarded economy of Congo is a long way from being integrated into the world's economy, its troubles are hurting the wider region. Conflict, as an obstacle to globalization, was to be a central issue in this meeting in which Congo and its president were to have had starring roles. Whether this meeting could have helped resolve the civil war in Congo is another question. Few of the key figures in the conflict, which has involved six countries along with several rebel movements, were expected to attend. Aside from President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe, who stopped in briefly Thursday before the formal opening of the summit, only Namibia's president, Sam Nujoma, was here. With many of the leading actors absent, the U.N. secretary-general took the opportunity to assure them and the world of the U.N.'s commitment to Congo and to implore the warring parties to practice restraint. ``I want to reaffirm the world's determination to play a key role in finding a peaceful solution to the crisis in the Democratic Republic of Congo,'' Annan said. ``I would like to call on all of the neighboring countries and all of the countries involved in that process not to complicate the situation, but instead to help the affected population of the Congo find peaceful solutions.''

El Salvador's economy was struggling well before a devastating earthquake brought down hillsides, ended lives, destroyed homes and displaced tens of thousands. Now, with many homeless and jobless, the battle has become even bigger. Saturday's disaster caused an estimated $1 billion in damage, nearly half the annual budget in a country where the third-largest source of revenue comes from Salvadorans living in the United States. It brought most commerce to a halt, closing banks, the airport and stores for several days. The coffee industry, the country's second-largest source of income, was hit the hardest. The magnitude-7.6 quake sent mountainside coffee fields tumbling into valleys below, wiping out villages where workers once lived and in some cases burying those harvesting the beans. Producers were having trouble making ends meet before the quake, preparing to cut 30 percent of the country's 135,000 coffee-related jobs because international coffee prices have hit rock-bottom. Now officials expect to slash even more _ although they aren't sure how many yet. Roughly 85 percent of the country's crop had been picked from the fields before the earthquake. But it will be a challenge to process it with 15 percent of the country's coffee mills crippled, Ricardo Espitia, executive director of the Salvadoran Coffee Council, said Thursday. More than 91,000 homes were damaged or destroyed across El Salvador, and 687 people were killed by the quake, including six in Guatemala. Roads were blocked by landslides and bridges collapsed, slowing or halting traffic across the small, mountainous country. At one sprawling coffee plantation along a mountain range just outside the capital of San Salvador, the quake buried or buckled the only access road to an area that produces 20 percent of the country's coffee. The majority of workers, who lived in shacks clinging to the edge of the narrow, mountain road, lost their homes. Most survivors are living in a refugee camp set up in a suburban San Salvador park, although some are still trapped on the mountain, living outside their collapsed homes until help arrives. ``These people are not going to come back to their places of origin, to the coffee areas,'' Espitia said. ``Even if the coffee producers want to find workers, they won't be able to find them because they will be in the cities or in the (United) States. This is going to create another wave of immigration.'' The quake prompted several of the 1 million Salvadorans living in the United States to fly home _ some to help rebuild family homes, others to bury the dead. Last year, the money they sent to El Salvador rose to a record $1.6 billion. President Francisco Flores has called for even greater contributions from abroad to aid in the recovery. Salvadorans began fleeing to the United States during the country's 12-year civil war, which ended in 1992, and have continued to migrate north ever since, largely because of a lack of work. Since the end of the war, the government has been trying to create more jobs by encouraging the development of the maquiladora, or assembly-for-export, industry, which makes up the country's largest source of income. On Jan. 1, El Salvador began using the dollar alongside its traditional currency, the colon, in an effort to attract more foreign investment and control inflation.

Defending champion Lindsay Davenport, who struggled through the first two rounds of the Australian Open, had an easier time Friday in beating Silvia Farina Elia 6-2, 6-1. On the warmest day of the tournament, with the temperature expected to reach 90 degrees, Davenport dominated the first center court match. She raced to a 4-0 lead in each set and closed out the victory in 63 minutes. ``I'm a lot happier with the way I played,'' Davenport said. ``You can tell when you're hitting the ball cleanly and well, even when you might not win every point. I was hitting with more power and depth and all that good stuff I've been lacking the last couple of matches.'' In men's play, second-seeded Marat Safin had his easiest match so far, beating Michal Tabara 6-1, 6-1, 6-4. Todd Martin beat No. 13 Cedric Pioline 6-4, 3-6, 6-3, 6-4. Pioline was the fourth seeded man to be sidelined. The No. 2-seeded Davenport's opponent in the fourth round will be No. 15 Kim Clijsters, who won the first 11 games and beat qualifier Nuria Llagostera 6-0, 6-1. When Llagostera finally got on the board by holding serve in the next-to-last game, the Spaniard pumped her fist and grinned. Davenport is 2-0 against the 17-year-old Clijsters, with both matches three-setters last year. ``It's always been like a close match, and I've had my chances,'' Clijsters said. ``I'm looking forward to it. I'm going to enjoy it.'' ``It's a tough match,'' Davenport said. ``It's funny _ for so many years I was the youngest player. Now I'm one of the oldest. The young girls are very fiery and have a hard-hitting game, and they go for their shots. ``The two times I played Kim, they were tough three-set matches. I don't expect anything different this time.'' Davenport, pushed to three sets in wins over Jelena Dokic and Greta Arn, had less trouble with Farina Elia. Davenport struggled with her serve but feasted on the Italian's second serve and moved better than in her previous match. One long rally had Davenport scrambling from sideline to sideline, but she managed to chase down a backhand and yank it crosscourt for a winner. Her groundstrokes were again a bit erratic, however, and she needed five match points in the final game to close out the victory. Thirteen seeded women made it through two rounds. Top-seeded Martina Hingis, who has lost three games so far, beat Els Callens 6-1, 6-0 Thursday. No. 3 Venus Williams defeated Meghann Shaughnessy 6-3, 7-6 (3). No. 6 Serena Williams eliminated Nadejda Petrova 6-3, 6-2. Top-seeded Gustavo Kuerten lost to Greg Rusedski 4-6, 6-4, 6-3, 2-6, 9-7 in the final match Thursday.

Pete Sampras is working a lot harder than he wants to at the Australian Open. Much of his effort Friday went into finding his serve-and-volley game. Defending champion Andre Agassi had to scramble at the end of the first set, but advanced to the round of 16 in just 68 minutes when David Prinosil retired with heat exhaustion. Agassi was leading 7-6 (11), 5-0 after trailing 6-2 in the tiebreaker. ``I'm definitely earning my paycheck this week,'' said Sampras, who has spent nine hours in three matches compared with Agassi's four hours. His serve was broken four times in the first three sets _ bringing his total for the week to 13 _ before he beat Argentina's Juan Ignacio Chela 6-4, 4-6, 4-6, 7-5, 6-2 in 3:08. ``I can only kick myself a little bit for letting my game slip'' while leading by one set and a break at 2-0 in the second set, Sampras said. Chela broke right back when Sampras missed a volley, and again in the seventh game when the No. 3 seed netted a volley and gestured as if he would smash his racket on the court. Two superb serve returns gave Chela another break in the third set's seventh game, and Sampras found himself trailing two sets to one. ``I've been down and out in that situation. You just try to hang in there,'' said Sampras, who earlier needed four sets each to beat Karol Kucera and Bohdan Ulihrach. Sampras didn't allow another break point, and Chela slipped into errors. ``It's not very common to break him twice,'' Chela said of the second set. In the 93-degree heat, Sampras said, ``this court definitely felt like I was playing on hot coals.'' But he said he still felt fit, and ``I feel like I get my game going at the right time.'' Sampras next plays fellow American Todd Martin, runner-up to Agassi in the 1999 U.S. Open. No. 6 Agassi meets Australia's Andrew Ilie, a crowd-pleaser who also reached the fourth round here in 1999. The winners of those two matches meet in the quarterfinals. Martin won 6-4, 3-6, 6-3, 6-4 against No. 13 Cedric Pioline, the fourth men's seed to lose. Ilie, who earlier eliminated No. 9 Juan Carlos Ferrero, beat Russia's Mikhail Youzhny 7-6 (3), 6-4, 6-2. No. 2 Marat Safin, the U.S. Open champion, breezed past Czech player Michal Tabara 6-1, 6-1, 6-4, advancing to a meeting with No. 14 Dominik Hrbaty, a 6-4, 6-4, 6-2 winner over Belgian Christophe Rochus. No. 12 Patrick Rafter, a two-time U.S. Open winner, beat Switzerland's Michel Kratochvil 6-4, 6-1, 7-5. A fourth women's seed also went out when 18-year-old Justine Henin extended her winning streak to 13 matches by beating No. 14 Sandrine Testud 6-2, 6-4. Henin next plays No. 4 Monica Seles, who beat France's Emilie Loit 6-3, 7-5. Another Belgian teen-ager, 17-year-old Kim Clijsters, seeded 15th, beat Spanish qualifier Nuria Llagostera 6-0, 6-1, advancing to a fourth-round meeting with defending champion and No. 2 seed Lindsay Davenport. Davenport beat Italy's Silvia Farina Elia 6-2, 6-1. No. 8 Anna Kournikova beat doubles partner Barbara Schett 2-6, 6-4, 6-3. She next plays Barbara Rittner, a 6-1, 3-6, 6-1 winner over Ruxandra Dragomir. No. 12 Jennifer Capriati defeated Spain's Virginia Ruano Pascual 6-0, 6-2. Next up is Spain's Marta Marrero, who beat Emmanuelle Gagliardi 4-6, 6-1, 6-2. After Prinosil pulled out, Agassi said, ``It's always disappointing when a match ends that way. You don't want anybody to get themselves in any kind of physical danger.'' He saved six set points in the first-set tiebreaker before pulling away. The heat was making the ball jump off the racket, causing him problems at first, but ``my game was taking form there so it would have been nice to finish,'' he said. Agassi wasn't expecting Sampras to fade despite his long hours on court. ``I've seen him win Slams injured. So I don't buy any of it. If he's tired or not, you've got to beat him. If he's injured or not, you've got to beat him. One of the things he has proven over the last decade is that that's not easy to do,'' Agassi added. Sampras has won a record 13 titles at Grand Slam tournaments. Agassi won his first two matches here, against Jiri Vanek and Paul Goldstein, with a loss of just 13 games in six sets. About two hours after his match, Prinosil said he felt OK, but his pulse was racing during the match and the trainer advised stopping.

Russian space officials on Friday set a new date for launching an unmanned cargo ship to help bring the 15-year-old Mir station down from space for good. Mission Control spokesman Valery Lyndin said that a government space commission decided to launch the Progress M1 cargo ship Wednesday morning, with docking scheduled three days later on Jan. 27. The Mir is scheduled to be brought down to Earth on March 6. The decision reflected Russian space experts' confidence that all operations aboard the Mir could be normalized following a sudden power outage that forced Mission Control to postpone the cargo ship's launch on Thursday. The power loss disabled the station's computer and its orientation system of gyroscopes, which keeps it stable. Yuri Koptev, the head of the Russian Aerospace Agency, said that ground controllers were planning to change the circuitry to bypass the faulty pieces of equipment and dead batteries. Koptev again defended the government's decision to bring down the Mir in February, accusing those who objected of being ``nonprofessionals'' motivated by ``pseudo-patriotic reasons.'' ``The situation is very tense and we should take into account the realities that we periodically encounter. There is nothing extraordinary in that, considering the station's age and the state of its resources.'' The power failure _ the second in as many months _ led to concern that the 140-ton station could plunge to Earth uncontrolled. But space officials quickly regained control of Mir and promised to jettison it safely in the Pacific Ocean as planned. The Russian government decided last year to discard the Mir and concentrate resources on the new NASA-led International Space Station, which the United States has urged for years. According to the current plan, the Progress M1 would dock with the Mir using automated systems. Using fuel from the Progress, rockets would fire and push Mir down to Earth. If anything goes awry, an emergency crew is on standby to blast off for Mir and direct the cargo ship's docking and subsequent descent. Koptev said that the cosmonauts would have to arrive at the station before it descends to about 150 miles. ``Beyond that, we cannot guarantee the safety of the crew.''

and back here in washington, u.s. defense secretary william cohen today issued the final report on the bombing of the "uss cole" that killed 17 sailors in yemen. the verdict -- everyone was to blame for security lapses, but no one, including the ship's captain, will be punished. i asked the secretary about the "cole" as he prepared to become a private citizen again. the ones responsible for the attack on "the cole" are the terrorists. the question about the accountability, how did it occur? what were the facts? we shouldn't try to hang this responsibility solely on the captain of the ship who fought with his crew valiantly to save it. i think everyone in the chain of command has to remain accountable all the way up to myself as secretary of defense. i william s. cohen. do swear. do swear. mr. secretary, you've spent most of your adult life in public service. mayor, representative, senator, defense secretary. if you were starting over again right now, would you be as drawn to public service? yes. public service is the highest calling that one could have. if you have some ability to make a contribution to help your fellow man and fellow woman then you wanna do that. cohen says there have been two major changes in the public arena -- nonstop and aggressive television coverage he says are not always responsible and senators, like him, who get fed up and leave voluntarily. there was a sense of partisanship and acrimony and a sense of frustration of too many time outs, too many quorum calls. too much time in trying to negotiate agreements just to shut off debates, that the rewards were not as great as they once were. cohen's current career comes to a close. with his wife janet by his side, he will move from public to private service. he says he'll take but one day off, sunday, to rest and reflect. you came to this job interested in national security matters and international policy, but you have never served in uniform. right. men and women of the united states armed forces, for the past four years, we've been blessed to serve with you as you stand guard in the night. what have you learned as defense secretary about yourself? i have learned that i should be forever grateful to those who have chosen voluntarily to wear the uniform. to go out day in and day out to put their lives on the line. lives are being risked every day on our behalf, and i think not enough of the american people fully appreciate that.

US Defense Secretary William Cohen says he and top US military commanders failed to anticipate threats to the US destroyer Cole in Yemen three months ago. A Navy report on the suicide bombing released today faults the USS Cole's Captain for failing to take certain security measures on entering the Yemeni port of Aden. Mr. Cohen says the Pentagon's entire chain of command should have been more imaginative and creative in anticipating the kinds of threats facing US forces around the world. Clever, committed terrorists are predators who will always search and look for weaknesses and we simply have to do a better job of finding and correcting those weaknesses before the terrorists find them and exploit them. The Navy report does not recommend any disciplinary action against the ship's skipper or any other individual.

Defense Secretary William Cohen closed out the USS Cole bombing investigation Friday by declaring that no one in the military chain of command should be accused of negligence, but all could be faulted for inadequate attention to terrorist threats. ``We were not complacent, but the terrorists found new opportunities before we found new protections,'' Cohen told a Pentagon news conference. The Navy released its final investigation report on the case Friday. As previously reported, Adm. Vern Clark, the chief of naval operations, has concluded that no one aboard the Cole should be disciplined. Cohen believes the entire military chain of command can be faulted for not paying more attention to the vulnerability of U.S. ships in areas where the terrorist threat is high. ``We didn't do all that needed to be done,'' he said. ``We have learned from this experience that we need to be more vigorous.'' At the same time, Cohen has concluded that no individuals should be punished. The Cole was bombed by suicide terrorists in a small boat while the destroyer was refueling in Aden, Yemen, on Oct. 12. The attack killed 17 sailors and nearly sunk the $1 billion ship. ``All of us in the whole chain of command have to do a better job and we had that obligation to all of the soldiers, sailors, airmen, Marines, coast guardsmen and their families, and a better job has to be done,'' Cohen said Friday on NBC's ``Today'' show. Cohen said he agrees with the findings of an independent panel he established to assess ways in which the Defense Department, in coordination with other government agencies, can provide better protection for U.S. forces in transit around the world. The panel cited, among other things, a need for better intelligence collection on terrorist threats. In his NBC interview, Cohen said the Cole bombing exposed a seam in U.S. security precautions. ``There has not been sufficient attention devoted to those ships that are in transit, about to come into a port or while they're in port,'' he said. ``You have a number of seams'' in security. ``It's our job to make sure that we appreciate the seams faster than the terrorists do. There will always be terrorists looking for weaknesses.'' Cohen wanted to close the Cole case before he left office. Friday was his final full day as defense secretary. The job of implementing the recommended improvements in security will fall to Cohen's successor, Defense Secretary-designate Donald Rumsfeld. Because the Cole's captain, Cmdr. Kirk Lippold, did not carry out all of approximately 60 planned actions to ensure the ship's protection while refueling in Aden harbor, some believed he would be punished and his career ruined. Instead, Clark supported a determination that Lippold had done what could have been reasonably expected under the circumstances and that he was not given necessary information about the terrorist threat in Aden, a major port at the southern tip of the Saudi peninsula. Clark also believes that even with security measures in place as prescribed, the attack would not have been prevented, officials said. The nature of the attack was unprecedented, although the threat was not unimaginable. The military's written guidelines on terror threats states explicitly that harbor craft of the sort that approached the Cole ``require special concern because they can serve as an ideal platform for terrorists.'' The guidelines say fire hoses should be ready for emergency use and personnel be briefed on using them for repelling boarders, small boats and ultralight aircraft. Lippold made a decision on his own not to prepare for the use of fire hoses, another senior defense official said, also speaking anonymously. Lippold apparently believed that fire hoses would not have strengthened the ship's defenses. Some crew members said after the bombing that they saw the small boat approach the Cole and assumed it was yet another harbor craft providing trash disposal and other services. No one on the Cole challenged the craft as it approached.

Ecuador is asking U.S. help in cleaning up a diesel fuel spill in the ecologically fragile Galapagos Islands, an official said Friday. The tanker Jessica, carrying some 243,000 gallons of fuel, ran aground Tuesday. It began leaking diesel oil Friday into a bay on San Cristobal island teeming with unique marine species, officials said. The Galapagos archipelago, 600 miles west of the Ecuadorean mainland, is Ecuador's main tourist attraction famous for giant tortoises and uniquely evolved birds and plants. Its plants and animals, found nowhere else in the world, have characteristics that helped Charles Darwin develop his theory of evolution. ``We are asking for official help from the United States Coast Guard, which has the specialized equipment for these types of operations,'' Environment Minister Rodolfo Rendon told local television Friday. ``We have taken all the necessary measures that are available to us and we are taking measures to prevent any possible tragedy _ and I would call it a tragedy _ that might occur in the coming hours,'' he added. Authorities have not specified how much fuel has spilled so far. Rendon said workers have removed 20,000 gallons of fuel from the ship. The tanker ran aground on the easternmost island in the Galapagos group. Local authorities blamed navigational error. Workers initially thought the ship had leaked machinery oil, ``but by the afternoon it was confirmed that it was the fuel the barge was carrying and that it was spilling,'' Galapagos National Park Director Eliecer Cruz said. Cruz said the situation was grave ``because the equipment for covering this type of emergency does not exist in this country.'' High tides expected this weekend could overturn the stranded tanker, causing a ``tremendous contamination,'' Cruz said. He said the spill ``is threatening colonies of sea lions, marine iguanas, birds like the blue-footed boobies, sea gulls, masked boobies and sea life, including sharks and lobsters.'' The president of the San Cristobal fishing cooperative blamed environmental authorities for not taking quicker action. ``Galapagos fishermen denounce to the world the irresponsibility of certain organizations in charge of conservation that have not taken action to avoid problems since Tuesday night,'' Alfonso Lozada told The Associated Press.

Serena Williams, eager to get out of the heat, beat Tamarine Tanasugarn 6-1, 6-4 in 58 minutes Saturday in the Australian Open. Top-seeded Martina Hingis joined Williams in the fourth round 18 minutes later, beating wild card Virginie Razzano on an adjacent court 7-5, 6-1. With a summer heat wave in its second day, temperatures were in the 90s and soared to 125 on the sunbaked hardcourts. A sizzling court prompted chair umpire Jane Harvey to allow a brief interruption in the middle of a game during the Hingis-Razzano match. ``Ladies and gentlemen, there'll be a short break while Miss Razzano changes her shoes,'' Harvey announced. Hingis decided to change shoes too. Also advancing was 13th-seeded Amelie Mauresmo, the 1999 runner-up. She beat former French Open champion Iva Majoli 6-4, 6-2. Unseeded Rita Grande beat Australian Evie Dominikovic 6-3, 6-4. Two Frenchmen advanced. No. 15 Arnaud Clement beat Roger Federer 7-6 (5), 6-4, 6-4, and No. 16 Sebastien Grosjean beat Thomas Johansson 6-4, 6-1, 6-4. Serena Williams, seeded sixth, lost her serve three times but was the much more aggressive player, belting 16 winners to four for Tanasugarn. Williams is one round from a possible quarterfinal matchup against top-seeded Martina Hingis. Hingis fell behind 4-2 but rallied to take the opening set in 39 minutes _ about the length of her first two matches. She then pulled away, with half her points coming on errors by the 17-year-old Razzano. Mauresmo was 0-for-5 on break-point opportunities before Majoli dumped a backhand into the net to lose the first set. Mauresmo broke again for a 2-0 lead in the second set, never lost serve and closed out the win in 1 hour, 16 minutes. The Frenchwoman has yet to drop a set in three rounds. Mauresmo, who was unseeded when she lost the 1999 final to Hingis, has struggled with a lower back injury since last spring. She was ranked sixth a year ago but has slipped to 20th.

Tens of thousands of protesters marched on President Joseph Estrada's residence to demand his ouster Saturday, after his allies abandoned him and officials considered naming a new leader. Battered by scandal, Estrada was apparently seeking last-minute concessions for his resignation. An air force fighter jet buzzed past the presidential palace in the late morning and four military helicopters hovered nearby _ reminders to Estrada that his defense chiefs had deserted him a day earlier. Police reportedly fired a shot near the palace to warn against clashes between 75,000 protesters and a much smaller gathering of pro-Estrada forces. Police said there was some pushing and rock throwing between groups and one small explosive went off, but no one was injured. Estrada, a former movie star who has been beleaguered for months by corruption allegations, was reportedly negotiating as favorable an exit as possible. Vice President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo was calling herself the ``new commander in chief,'' and officials were already discussing plans to swear her in _ although nothing was finalized. On the streets, where demonstrations have persisted nonstop since Tuesday's collapse of the Senate impeachment trial, a quarter-million rallied on Friday and tens of thousands remained all night _ waving flags, listening to rock 'n' roll bands and chanting _ before starting their march. ``This is the only way to show President Estrada that he has to step down for the good of the country and the love of the nation,'' said one protest leader, Teddy Casino. Jaime Cardinal Sin, Manila's influential Roman Catholic leader, asked the protesters to delay the march over concerns of possible violence, but he was ignored. The protests, which were festive at times, united elements as diverse as big business and left-wing communist groups. Peanut vendors mingled with high school bands, students in school uniforms and comics impersonating Estrada. Many demonstrators sported banners, T-shirts or stickers reading ``Erap resign'' _ referring to the president by his nickname. A ``sad'' Estrada remained inside his palace residence on Saturday preparing a statement, a spokesman said. The vice president said she did not want to take the oath of office until Estrada had resigned. Estrada's spiritual adviser, the evangelist Mike Velarde, said he had spoken to Estrada, who was packing his bags but it was not clear when he would leave. ``There is a vacuum of leadership,'' said Supreme Court Justice Artemio Panganiban. The chief justice, Hilario Davide, believed there was a constitutional basis for installing a new leader, according to Panganiban. Earlier this week, Estrada had appeared to be on the verge of beating charges that he received millions of dollars in kickbacks and funds skimmed from tobacco taxes. But on Friday, amid rumors of an impending coup, Estrada went on television twice: first to offer to resume the impeachment trial, then _ after the stream of defections accelerated _ to propose he step down after elections in May in which he would not be a candidate. However, Estrada's opponents wanted him out of office immediately to end a political crisis that has further damaged this Southeast Asian nation's already ailing economy. Sen. Raul Roco, speaking on behalf of the opposition, said Estrada had until 6 a.m. Saturday (5 p.m. EST Friday) to step down. If he refused, Roco said, the crowds of protesters already on the streets would march on the presidential palace. ``Our soldiers will give us support,'' Roco claimed. On Friday, the crowd near the ``people power'' monument erupted into screams and cheers when the head of the armed forces, Gen. Angelo Reyes, stepped on stage. A low-flying airplane dropped confetti and drummers beat a frenetic rhythm as Reyes, who had been an Estrada supporter, called on the president to resign. The appearance recalled the end of Marcos _ who fled the country after the people and the military turned against him _ and it fired up the crowd. ``I am overwhelmed,'' said Antoinette Cordero, a 21-year-old medical student who stood on tiptoes for a glimpse of Reyes in his crisply pressed uniform. ``I was feeling bad about the government and the future. That just changed.'' Wildly chanting demonstrators hanged Estrada in effigy and conducted a mock trial that found him guilty. National police officials _ many still in uniform _ mingled with protesters, some of whom chanted ``soldiers of the country, standing up for their rights.'' The air force chief, the defense secretary and other Cabinet ministers who abandoned Estrada also appeared. Estrada's offer to step down after elections appeared to be aimed at preventing Vice President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo from succeeding him. Opposition leaders said they were negotiating with Estrada. Four armored vehicles pulled into the palace compound Friday evening then left moments later. Officials said three airplanes were put on standby at nearby Villamor Air Base amid rumors Estrada and his family could head for the United States or Australia. Macapagal-Arroyo's chief of staff said Estrada was reportedly asking for a few days before stepping down. ``That's not acceptable,'' said chief of staff Renato Corona. He also hinted the opposition would not accept a pardon for Estrada, saying: ``If a crime has been committed he has to face the charges.'' Estrada has been battling for his political future since his longtime friend Ilocos Sur Gov. Luis Singson came forward in October and claimed he had helped the president take some $8 million in kickbacks from illegal gambling and $2.7 million skimmed from tobacco taxes. The charges eventually built into the impeachment trial at the Senate. The trial collapsed when senators serving as judges voted narrowly on Tuesday to block access to bank records prosecutors said would prove Estrada had millions of dollars hidden away. The prosecutors resigned in protest, prompting demonstrations demanding Estrada's ouster that grew larger and larger each day. The man popularly known as ``Erap'' who came to power in a landslide 1998 election victory had run out of allies. Even his top ally in the Senate, Francisco Tatad, said it was time for his friend to ``do the honorable thing'' and end a ``crisis of epic proportions.'' Sensing Estrada was finished, traders swung into action late Friday and pushed the battered peso sharply higher. It surged to 47 to the dollar, compared to its previous level of more than 54 to the dollar.

Of the torrent of words unleashed in the last decade to describe Russia's experiment in self-government, maybe none are more revealing than the ones President Vladimir Putin uttered last year as he assured Russians that their democratic future was secure. The days of strongman rule are over, he said; in the new Russia, there will be only one dictatorship: a ``dictatorship of the law.'' A democracy, defined in terms of dictatorship: The concept is Russian to the marrow. For all its revolutionary rhetoric and flirtation with anarchy, what this sprawling nation knows best _ almost all it has known _ is order, imposed from above. And after a year in power, that is what Putin has delivered: a dictatorship of the law, with greater emphasis on the first noun than the second. Through deft and sometimes pitiless use of Russia's convoluted legal system, Putin's Kremlin has managed to produce a measure of order and even modest prosperity that his embattled predecessor, Boris Yeltsin, could only dream of. The days when tycoons ran the economy and owned politicians seem largely over. The governors of the 89 provinces, once little czars who openly scorned Moscow's orders, are largely docile. The ideological gridlock that stalled Yeltsin's capitalist reforms has melted away, enabling the Kremlin to push through pension reforms, a flat tax and other thoroughly liberal economic measures. But the cost has been extraordinarily high. Some of Putin's opponents are in self-imposed exile, driven abroad by highly selective _ some would say political _ criminal investigations. Others have been politically neutered by new laws or new twists on old ones. Russian democracy now speaks with but one voice. Just 18 months ago, leaders of five ideological factions were waging a pitched public battle to succeed Yeltsin. Now there is only Putin, a man of no classifiable ideology beyond building a strong Russia, his rule endorsed by three of every four Russians, according to polls. Putin's increasingly obvious authoritarian bent leads some experts to conclude that Russian democracy is about to hurtle off the rails. But the better question may be whether Russian democracy is simply on an altogether different track. Putin has said more than once, of course, that Russian democracy will never parrot the West's liberal model, and that he believes a strong state is a guarantor of freedom, not a threat to it. He also makes no apologies for breaking eggs to make his democratic omelet: In Russia, he said in an interview last summer, even democratic change has always come from the top. He has a point there: Even Yeltsin implemented nearly half his government programs by decree, and rewrote an entire constitution after putting down a communist putsch in 1993. And Putin's calming effect has even extended to the state parliament, where the lower house, the notoriously fractious Duma, has experienced a marked drop in fistfights. The question is where a strong state ends and a strongman begins. And among many outsiders, the fear is that Putin's orderly democracy is being imposed without any of the niceties _ such as a compact between the governed and the government _ that give the system lasting legitimacy. Indeed, quite the opposite. ``Putin is clearly aware that the development of the country depends on his ability to create some kind of predictable legal certainty,'' said Stephen Holmes, an expert on Russian politics and professor at New York University's school of law. ``But the law is being used almost at all levels as a threat which can be applied or not applied by officials who can then attract concessions.'' That isn't the rule of law,'' he said. ``It's the use of a rule that actually instills a sense in people that they don't know what to expect'' _ a state that, in Soviet times, might have been called fear. Look at last week's Russian police blotter, and judge for yourself where the legal dictatorship is going: On Tuesday, Moscow prosecutors jailed the top fiscal officer at the Media-Most press empire, operator of Russia's only independent television network and a powerful critic of the government, on fraud charges. The arrest was part of what has universally come to be seen as a political vendetta: months of previous raids, arrests and charges against Media-Most officials have yet to produce a conviction or, sometimes, even to be explained. Asked about it, Putin says he will not meddle with the wheels of justice. On Thursday, New York FBI agents arrested Pavel Borodin on a warrant secured by Switzerland, which has charged him with laundering $25 million tied to a notorious kickback scheme involving a 1990s renovation of the Kremlin grounds. Borodin is the Kremlin official who first brought Putin to Moscow in 1997, and this time, Putin's foreign minister summoned the U.S. ambassador and demanded the detainee's immediate release. These are not isolated incidents. Earlier this winter Alexander Rutskoi, a critic of the Kremlin who is governor of Kursk province, was bounced from his own re-election ballot for the slightest of reasons: misstating the size of his apartment and neglecting to report that he owned a used car. When the newspaper Izvestia published harsh critiques last month of the Kremlin's plan to restore Stalin's national anthem, the government abruptly filed suit to reverse the 1990s privatization of the newspaper's headquarters _ and then just as abruptly withdrew the suit, having sent its message of displeasure. Boris Berezovsky, a powerful if widely despised tycoon who also opposes Putin, has fled the country under criminal investigation of his involvement in Aeroflot, the Russian airline. So has Vladimir Gusinsky, the head of Media-Most, now under house arrest in Spain on a Russian warrant. In July, Putin said the state had only picked up the cudgel against businessmen who sought to exercise political influence. Yet some tycoons _ notably Roman Abramovich, an oilman who used his wealth to win a governorship in a remote Siberian province _ have escaped the state's wrath. The Kremlin insists that nobody is being prosecuted unfairly, and in a sense, it may be right. The mass privatization and spoils-divvying that followed the Soviet collapse in 1991 was so riddled with favoritism and rule-bending that a diligent lawman could find something wrong almost anywhere. Everyone in Russia is guilty; the only issue is who gets caught. The situation is virtually the opposite of the Soviet system, in which almost everyone was innocent but lived in terror of being seized on trumped-up charges anyway. Whether the new arrangement will hasten a government that is also the opposite of Soviet dictatorship is something only the Kremlin can answer.

In a sister act on adjoining courts, Venus and Serena Williams each lost just five games, had winning stretches of seven games, and made unwanted mistakes. Heading toward a possible semifinal meeting in the Australian Open, both advanced to the round of 16 on Saturday, spending less than an hour in temperatures magnified to 125 degrees by sun reflecting off the courts. Venus, the Wimbledon, U.S. Open and Olympic champion, beat Czech player Denisa Chladkova 6-4, 6-1, serving eight aces at speeds up to 118 mph. Serena won 6-1, 6-4 against Thailand's Tamarine Tanasugarn. Top seed Martina Hingis, who could prevent a sisters' meeting, reached the fourth round by coming back from 2-4 to beat wild card entry Virginie Razzano of France 7-5, 6-1. ``It was very hot. I didn't really want to make my stay too long,'' Venus Williams said. ``Today was pretty fortunate.'' The air temperature was 93 degrees, but thermometers at courtside soared higher. Clouds lowered the temperature to 75 for some of the later matches. After gaining an early break, Venus said, she was hurt by unforced errors. But the No. 3 seed started a seven-game winning streak at 4-4, taking her to 5-0 in the second set in the main stadium court. Serena won seven in a row after being broken in the first game. But then Tamarine broke twice and held twice for a 4-3 lead in the second set, and Serena had to break again in the ninth game with some heavy hitting to set up the victory on nearby Court 1. ``I was pretty disappointed with the way I played today,'' Serena said. ``It's not that I wouldn't move my feet _ I couldn't. It was very weird. ``The wind was chasing the ball a little, and I just didn't do the things that I want to do,'' the No. 6 seed added. The wind seemed much stronger on Serena's court, which has lower walls than the adjoining Rod Laver Arena where Venus played. In the fourth round, Serena will play 17-year-old Czech player Daja Bedanova, who upset Olympic silver medalist Elena Dementieva 2-6, 7-6 (5), 6-3. Dementieva, the No. 9 seed, survived five set points and forced a tiebreaker in the second set, but then let a 4-2 lead slip away. Bedanova broke serve in the final set's eighth game and finished with two aces. Venus meets No. 13 Amelie Mauresmo, the 1999 Australian runner-up, who beat Croatia's Iva Majoli 6-4, 6-2. Dementieva was the sixth women's seed ousted. Earlier Saturday, No. 7 Mary Pierce, the French Open champion, lost 6-3, 6-2 to Argentina's Paola Suarez. Suarez next plays No. 10 Amanda Coetzer, a 6-2, 6-4 winner over German Marlene Weingartner, and Hingis meets Italy's Rita Grande, who beat Australian Evie Dominikovic 6-3, 6-4. A fifth seed fell on the men's side. No. 10 Wayne Ferreira, who said he was hampered by a finger injury from catching a ball in the warmup, lost 6-0, 3-6, 6-4, 6-3 to 19-year-old Swede Andreas Vinciguerra. Greg Rusedski, who beat top seed Gustavo Kuerten, moved on easily by ousting German qualifier Lars Burgsmuller 6-1, 6-2, 6-1 in 1 hour, 25 minutes. Next up is No. 15 Arnaud Clement, who beat Switzerland's Roger Federer 7-6 (5), 6-4, 6-4. Rusedski said he was pleased at coming back strongly after his five-set match with Kuerten. ``That's another positive for me, to come off the match feeling physically good and being able to serve and volley, serve a high percentage again and play the game I wanted to,'' Rusedski said. Olympic gold medalist Yevgeny Kafelnikov, the 1999 champion and 2000 runner-up here, and 2000 semifinalist Magnus Norman both struggled for 2 1/2 hours, starting in the heat and ending in cooler temperatures. No. 5 Kafelnikov rallied to beat American Chris Woodruff, a quarterfinalist last year, 6-7 (3), 7-5, 6-2, 6-3. ``Winning the second set was a huge relief,'' said Kafelnikov, who next plays Vinciguerra. ``I knew I was back in the match and my chances would come.'' Woodruff said heat wasn't the problem. ``I became a little too predictable with the way I'm playing,'' Woodruff said. ``He seemed to get a good groove.'' No. 4 Norman beat Spain's Alex Calatrava 7-6 (2), 3-6, 7-6 (2), 6-3, to advance to a meeting with No. 16 Sebastien Grosjean. Grosjean beat Sweden's Thomas Johansson 6-4, 6-1, 6-4.

Joseph Kabila, the newest occupant of the presidential palace here since his father, President Laurent D. Kabila, was killed this week, is a small, soft-spoken man with little military and no political experience. He has grown up and been educated outside Congo, does not speak the national language and is expected to face a potentially explosive power struggle from the moment his father's body is put in the ground early next week. Joseph Kabila had been scheduled to address the nation on Thursday night, after the government finally confirmed his father's death after he was shot by a young palace guard on Tuesday, but the Congolese have yet even to hear his voice. According to various reports, he could be as young as 30 or as old as 32. Those who have known him say he is respected but ill-prepared to lead a large country still in the grip of a 29-month war and that he is likely being used by an inner circle of the former president that wants to buy time until it can figure out how to remain in power. The rebels do not recognize his status as Congo's new president, nor does the political opposition here in the capital. Many Congolese regard him suspiciously because he is seen as a foreigner (he is believed to be the son of a Tutsi woman) who has spent little time in Kinshasa and is not fluent in any of the local languages or in the national one, French, but rather in English and Swahili. ``It's very difficult to determine who is really in control now,'' said a Western diplomat here. ``But I don't think that anyone believes Joseph Kabila is in control. He's been put as a figurehead until the real power structure turns out.'' Indeed, many here expect a power struggle will follow the state funeral early next week of Kabila, whose body was flown on Saturday to Lubumbashi, his hometown in southeastern Congo, from Zimbabwe, where a military band played and soldiers carried the coffin along a red carpet on the runway of the Harare International Airport on Saturday morning. The body is expected to arrive here on Sunday. Few things appear constant in the Congo's political and military rivalries and alliances. And few here believe that there will be any discernible movement in the war here until a real power _ capable of dealing with the foreign countries, rebellions and various militias _ emerges in Kinshasa. For now, the small circle of hardliners who had surrounded the deceased president (most are from his home region, Katanga, and many are relatives) appeared to be fighting to consolidate his son's standing. ``Even in death, Kabila remains alive,'' read Friday's edition of ``L'Avenir,'' a newspaper close to Abdoulaye Yerodia Ndombasi, who long served as foreign minister and is a member of that circle. It is not clear yet whether Joseph Kabila has the full backing of the Angolans or the Zimbabweans, the Kinshasa government's main allies. In recent days, both countries have sent additional troops to Kinshasa. What is clear, however, is that many Congolese are getting ready to oppose the new president, secretly or openly. ``This young man has no experience _ he didn't even attend any real military academy,'' said Joseph Olenghankoy, one of the best-known opposition figures here. ``There are people who want to keep power and who are using this boy. The Congolese people will not accept that.'' ``After his father is buried,'' he added, ``the situation risks becoming extremely unpredictable.'' Even more critical will be the loyalty of the Congolese military. After coming to power, Laurent Kabila came to trust only the troops from his home region in critical positions, including the control of cities like Kinshasa and Lubumbashi. But soldiers from other regions and ethnic groups are not believed to be so loyal. What's more, many senior military officials under Mobutu Sese Seko, who have been sidelined in the last four years, are waiting quietly. ``Does Joseph Kabila command the Congolese army?'' said a colonel under Mobutu who served eight months in prison during the Kabila regime. ``He commands only his father's militia. In Kinshasa, the Katangese army is here, so he is safe. But the non-Katangese army will not side with him.'' As the colonel spoke here inside the garden of his villa, which he was able to keep from being seized, he added: ``Kabila's son is nothing special. He's zero. He received his basic military training in Rwanda, he goes to China for further training and comes back as a major general. You don't lead a country like the Congo with that level of training. I don't think Joseph will last.'' In a news conference here on Saturday, Mwenze Kongolo, the justice minister, said that Joseph Kabila had been a unanimous choice. ``We did meet, the government as well as the highest command of the army,'' he said. ``We thought we should pick somebody that we could all trust, and the name of Joseph Kabila came up.''

President Clinton on Saturday morning commuted the prison sentence of a former terrorist who had been denied parole because of charges brought against her in a notorious 1981 armed robbery of a Brink's armored car that left two police officers and a security guard dead. The prisoner, Susan L. Rosenberg, was free to walk out of the Danbury Correctional Facility in Danbury, Conn., said her lawyer, Howard Gutman. Friends of Rosenberg's were trying to find the warden, whose office was closed Saturday morning, so he could release her, Gutman said. Rosenberg was among 36 people whose prison sentences were commuted in Clinton's last acts in office. Rosenberg, who was serving a 58-year sentence for an unrelated New Jersey explosives case, was never tried in the Brink's robbery. But the government denied her parole, even though she was considered a model prisoner, saying there was evidence she was involved in the Brink's robbery in Nanuet, N.Y, as well as other crimes. She was ordered last year to remain in custody for 15 more years. Because of her conduct in prison, Rosenberg had been eligible for release last year even though her sentence was for 58 years. ``Susan's additional 15 years of incarceration exposed many of the flaws in the unfettered discretion of the parole board,'' Gutman said. ``The president's action vindicates the concept that no American should be imprisoned on charges for which they were never tried or convicted. We couldn't be more delighted.'' Rosenberg has always denied any involvement in the Brink's robbery and the other crimes cited by the Parole Commission. Prosecutors dropped the charges against her on the grounds that she was already serving a lengthy prison sentence. Late last year, Rosenberg asked Judge Charles S. Haight of U.S. District Court in Manhattan to either release her or reinstate the Brink's conspiracy charges and then dismiss them outright. Haight did not issue a ruling before the president acted. The office of Mary Jo White, the U.S. attorney in Manhattan, opposed Rosenberg's pleas. The office had no comment on the commutation Saturday. Clinton granted pardons or commutations of sentences for more than 140 people on Saturday, an hour and a half before he left office. One was William D. Fugazy, a former transportation executive from the New York area who pleaded guilty in 1997 to perjury during a bankruptcy proceeding. Rosenberg's name gained a certain prominence in the New York area after her arrest in 1984. She and a companion, Timothy A. Blunk, were caught unloading 740 pounds of dynamite and weapons, including a submachine gun, from their car off Interstate 295 in Cherry Hill, N.J., in November of that year. She admitted that she was planning to supply the explosives to others for bombings, and she has apologized for the crime. But at the time, Rosenberg was also wanted for fleeing while under indictment for charges that included federal racketeering, bank robberies and the Brink's case, in which $1.6 million was taken. The Brink's truck was attacked on Oct. 20, 1981 by a band of people that included members of the Weather Underground and the Black Liberation Army. The security guard was killed in the Nanuet Mall, and the two police officers were killed in a roadblock shootout. Federal investigations later showed that Rosenberg lived for a year in New Haven with Marilyn Jean Buck, the driver of the getaway car. In the explosives case, Rosenberg was convicted in 1985 of eight counts of possessing explosives, weapons and fake identification cards. She was sentenced to 58 years in prison. The length of the sentence gave Rudolph Giuliani, then the U.S. attorney, reason to drop the charges in the Brink's robbery. Rosenberg objected at the time, but to no avail. Blunk, who was not involved in the Brink's robbery, was paroled after 12 years. While she was in prison, Rosenberg developed AIDS programs for prisoners, counseled troubled inmates and worked in the prison chapel and library, a prison official said. That official told the Parole Commission that he considered Rosenberg ``a perfect example of one who has truly changed.'' Nevertheless, the Parole Commission said it was taking into account crimes for which she was not serving time. That included the Brink's case, as well as other crimes that prosecutors said were committed by violent radicals who called themselves the Family. The commission said it did not find Rosenberg's denials of involvement in those crimes to be credible. Rosenberg contended that the government had robbed her of due process by keeping her in prison on charges that were never brought to trial. White's office said that Rosenberg gave up her right to a trial on the Brink's charges when she fled while under indictment. In a recent court filing, a prosecutor said that Rosenberg's release would be justified only after she had served 25 more years. But Saturday, Gutman said that ``she has served her time and will be a productive member of society.''

George Walker Bush was inaugurated 43rd president of the United States on Saturday, his eyes glistening with emotion as he became only the second son in American history to follow his father to the White House. At a cold, drizzly noon, Bush raised his right hand and swore the oath of the office and promised to bring ``civility, courage, compassion and character'' to the White House. In the pageantry of the transfer of power, George Herbert Walker Bush brushed back a tear as he stood proud witness to his son's inauguration 12 years after his own. The elder Bush served one term; Bill Clinton defeated him for re-election in 1992. Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist administered the oath of office, first to Vice President Dick Cheney, then to Bush, whose hairbreadth election was cemented by a Supreme Court decision five weeks after the ballots were cast. Bush's wife, Laura, and 19-year-old twin daughters, Jenna and Barbara, stood with him as he took the oath, hand on the same historic Bible his father used in 1989. The new president embraced them, shook hands with Clinton and Al Gore, the Democrat he defeated in the overtime election, and then turned to his parents. First a handshake with his father, then a brief embrace. Then the new president stepped to the microphone of the white inaugural stand before the flag-draped West Front of the Capitol, presented for the first time as ``The president of the United States, George W. Bush.'' So ended the eight years of Clinton, who had declared that he would work until his last minute in power, and did, with a sheaf of more than 100 presidential pardons just before he left the White House. A day earlier, Clinton made an immunity deal to avoid indictment for false statements about the sex scandal that led to his impeachment. Bush set his themes in a 15-minute address that offered a salute to Gore for ``a contest conducted with spirit and ended with grace.'' The applause was muffled, from gloved hands, 14 rounds, most subdued, one with cheers when Bush promised to pursue the tax cut on which he campaigned. Bush said he will not accept nor allow a situation in which ``our differences run so deep it seems we share a continent but not a country.'' There was a hint of later snow in the air and in the weather forecast as Clinton and Bush shared a limousine from the White House to the Capitol for the inauguration of the Republican whom the outgoing president campaigned to defeat. Bush said unity is the work of leaders, and ``this is my solemn pledge: I will work to build a single nation of justice and opportunity.'' A scant two hours before he left office, Clinton issued more pardons to clear the records of convicted Americans including his former Whitewater business partner, newspaper heiress Patty Hearst, the president's brother Roger, on a drug conviction, and a former Cabinet member. Then he and Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton had a last dance in the White House foyer, shortly before Bush and his wife arrived for coffee. The incoming president gave a thumbs up on the steps of his new home. In his inaugural address, Bush promised to ``live and lead'' by firm principles: ``To advance my convictions with civility, to pursue the public interest with courage, to speak for greater justice and compassion, to call for responsibility, and try to live it as well.'' He told Americans that ``what you do is as important as anything government does. ``I ask you to seek a common good beyond your comfort, to defend needed reforms against easy attacks, to serve your nation, beginning with your neighbor. ``I ask you to be citizens,'' he said. ``Citizens not spectators. Citizens not subjects. Responsible citizens, building communities of service and a nation of character.'' Among the thousands of citizens who gathered to watch the ceremony and the inaugural parade were protesters, who chanted, waved anti-Bush signs, and at one point, slashed tires on some automobiles when security checks slowed their entrance to a designated protest zone. As Bush was being sworn in, hundreds of police tried to restrain thousands of demonstrators 16 blocks away. Some were arrested. At least one officer was bloodied. Bush offered a special message to Americans who ``doubt the promise, even the justice, of our own country,'' saying he will be a president striving to ensure opportunity and equality for all. He found scant support among minority voters in the disputed election; blacks opposed him 10 to 1 and some still question the legitimacy of his victory, cemented by the Supreme Court five weeks after the Nov. 7 election. The new president disputed people he said ``seem to believe that our politics can afford to be petty,'' saying the stakes are too high for that attitude, that there must be leadership to strengthen education, and to make sure that the economy does not ``drift and decline.'' His most specific promises: _ Action to ``reclaim America's schools.'' _ Reform of Social Security and Medicare. _ Tax cuts ``to recover the momentum of our economy'' and reward the effort of working Americans. _ A national defense ``beyond challenge,'' and action to confront ``weapons of mass destruction,'' the national missile defense system he advocates. ``I feel humbled and honored,'' Bush said as he left the stage for a traditional inaugural luncheon inside the Capitol. His first official act there was to sign the nominations of his Cabinet members, three of whom had been cleared for Senate confirmation later in the day. For the new president, Saturday's public schedule began with a traditional worship service at St. John's Episcopal Church, across Lafayette Park from the White House. His family and Cheney were with him. Next, coffee at the White House with the Clintons and Gores. Bush and his wife walked hand in hand up the White House steps, where the Clintons waited to greet them. ``How are you doing?'' Bush asked Hillary Clinton. ``Great,'' she replied. The leaders of government and the diplomatic corps had seats of privilege on the West Front of the Capitol and throngs assembled for blocks along the rain-soaked National Mall, a vista framed by the Washington Monument and the Lincoln Memorial. The winter drizzle made plastic raincoats the preferred dress, and left some VIP seats empty. Nor was the crowd beyond them as large as at some prior inaugurations. The new President Bush is the first Republican since Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1953 to take office with GOP control of both the House, narrowly, and the Senate, only because of the tie-breaking vote of Cheney. Clinton was still doing business Saturday morning. ``I pledged that I would work until the last hour of the last day. Well, here we are,'' he said in his final weekly radio address. As though to underscore his point, Clinton issued the string of pardons and an executive order creating a Governors Island National Monument in New York harbor. Bush's first executive orders were to set ethics guidelines for his administration and declare a national day of prayer. The new president also prepared an order to effectively block a series of executive orders issued by Clinton in his final weeks in office, among them measures to put wide areas of federal land off limits to mining or commercial use, and setting new guidelines for managed care programs under Medicare. Bush's order will impose a moratorium on publication of the last-days Clinton decisions, without which they can't take effect. Along the ceremonial mile from the Capitol to 1600 Pennsylvania Ave., there was pomp and protest on an occasion of history and sentiment, an emotional one for the incoming Bush and the departing Clinton. It also was an inauguration with unprecedented security steps, checkpoints near the Capitol, 10 more along the Pennsylvania Avenue parade route, to check the bags and packages of thousands upon thousands of spectators. The ritual of inauguration, the 54th, was performed with a cast like none assembled before _ Rehnquist, whose court issued the last word on the election, the loser and winner of that election, the loser and winner of the 1992 election. Former President Bush was the first father of an incoming president to see his son take office in 40 years, since Joseph P. Kennedy watched John F. Kennedy inaugurated. Only once before, when John Quincy Adams traced his father's steps into the White House 176 years ago, had the son of a president become a president. Not since 1888 had a president been elected without winning the nationwide popular vote. Gore outpolled Bush by more than a half-million votes, but could only watch what could have been as Bush took office. Bush beat him, with one vote to spare, in the Electoral College, where it counts. The 1876 presidential election was the last to be contested in overtime. The 2000 election was the first settled by the Supreme Court. Before the inauguration, Bush had said that he hopes to convince black voters he will work for them too and that he merits minority support like that he gained in his re-election as governor of Texas. His secretary of state, Colin Powell, is the first black American chosen for that position, one of two in a Bush Cabinet that includes three women, two Asian Americans, one of them a Democrat, and a Hispanic American. After the ceremony, the parade, and eight black-tie inaugural balls _ Bush said he was brushing up his two-step with Laura _ the president planned an open house on Sunday for about 3,000 people at the White House. Then the first work week, when Bush will concentrate on Congress, meet with Republicans, bipartisan congressional leaders and newly elected members of both parties. His first big request of Congress will be for the education bill he touted in his campaign. After a farewell rally at Andrews Air Force Base, Clinton was flying to New York for another one. At 54, Clinton left office at the age at which his successor enters it, and as the youngest former president since Theodore Roosevelt, who was 50 in 1909.

Pakistan says it will abide by United Nations sanctions against Afghanistan's ruling Taliban movement. As Ayaz Gul reports from Islamabad, the sanctions went into effect Friday after the Taliban refused to hand over terror suspect Osama Bin Laden. Pakistan is a strong supporter of Afghanistan's Taliban movement and has criticized the new UN sanctions. Foreign Ministry spokesman Riyaz Mohammed Khan told reporters Saturday that Pakistan will abide by the UN sanctions. However Mr. Khan says ignoring the realities of Afghanistan will aggravate the human suffering in that war ravaged and drought stricken country. The UN sanctions were approved by the Security Council last month after Taliban refused to hand over Saudi exile Osama Bin Laden who is wanted in the United States on terrorism charges. The sanctions, which were strongly backed by the United States and Russia, include a ban on arm sales to the Taliban, reduction of its diplomatic missions abroad and travel restrictions on Taliban officials. The arms ban exclude anti-Taliban forces in the Afghan civil war. For VOA News this is Ayaz Gul in Islamabad.

Now turning our attention to Africa. The government of the Democratic Republic of Congo is defending its decision to name Joseph Kabila President following the assassination of his father Loron Kabila on Tuesday. VOA's Louis Ramirez in the Congolese capital Kinshasa reports questions continue to linger about the DRC's leadership as the embattled country prepares to lay its slain leader to rest. Loron Kabila's son General Joseph Kabila was appointed to head the government shortly after his father was fatally shot at the presidential palace on Tuesday. On official documents and in the State media he is already referred to as President although he has not been formally sworn in. Rebel groups who've been fighting the government in the East of the country have rejected Mr. Kabila's appointment as the Congolese leader as have opposition politicians in exile. But the criticism is not limited to Kabila opponents. On the streets of Kinshasa some people who say they supported Loron Kabila voiced their anger Saturday saying they challenge the government to explain whether the appointment is constitutional. Some critics say the naming of a son to succeed his father instead of holding elections is undemocratic and tantamount to installing a monarchy. Addressing reporters in Kinshasa Saturday Justice Minister Muenze Congolo defended the government's decision saying it was necessary to avoid chaos in the days after the assassination. What is the top priority at this time? Do we assassinate the President in the morning and have elections in the afternoon? Is that realistic? Yes, you can talk about monarchy but what is the price of receiving those criticism compared to the security of the people. Compared to what would have happened if we didn't have a structure. The appointment was made by members of the cabinet all of whom retained their posts. Joseph Kabila, who is in his early thirties and has no experience in politics, has not made any public statement to the Congolese people since the death of his father. Officials have not said who they believe might have been responsible for the killing. They say investigations are underway but are giving no details of whom they suspect. Kinshasa has remained calm in the days after the assassination. The city remains under a nighttime curfew amid a heightened military presence. Tanks and armored vehicles have been positioned in areas surrounding some government ministries. President Kabila's body is to lie in state in Kinshasa starting on Sunday. The remains have been flown back to the country from Zimbabwe where officials say he had been airlifted for treatment following the shooting. Meanwhile, skirmishes have continued over the past few days in the Eastern DRC where government forces have been battling rebels backed by Rwanda and Uganda. Louis Ramirez, VOA News, Kinshasa.

A team of U.S. experts headed Saturday for the ecologically fragile Galapagos Islands to help clean up an oil spill that officials said threatened to become ``a major environmental disaster.'' The tanker Jessica, carrying about 243,000 gallons of fuel, ran aground Tuesday. It began leaking diesel oil Friday into a bay on San Cristobal Island populated by rare marine species, government officials said. Authorities blamed navigational error. Ecuadorean officials, saying they lacked the equipment for handling the spill, requested help Friday. Ten members of the U.S. Coast Guard's pollution response National Strike Force headed to the easternmost island Saturday equipped with specialized oil spill equipment such as high-capacity pumps and inflatable oil containment barges, the Coast Guard said. A coordinator from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration was traveling with the team. Fuel was steadily leaking through a fissure in the tanker, said Ecuador's environmental minister, Rodolfo Rendon. The current was pushing the spill south toward one of the largest colonies of sea lions in the archipelago, he said. ``If this situation continues, we may be faced with a major environmental disaster,'' Rendon said Saturday. The U.S. team's main goal is to drain the oil from the ship, he said. Crews from the state oil company also are trying to retrieve the oil from the Jessica. It was not clear how much fuel has spilled so far, but Rendon said 20,000 gallons of fuel had been retrieved. The Galapagos Islands, 600 miles off the west coast of Ecuador, are famous for their giant tortoises and rare species of birds and plants. The islands were the basis for Charles Darwin's theory of evolution. Floating nets and barriers were erected to control the spill, but at least 12 sea lions and several birds already have been harmed by the fuel, Rendon said. The spill also was threatening colonies of marine iguanas, blue-footed boobies, masked boobies and sea gulls, as well as sharks and lobsters, Galapagos National Park Director Eliecer Cruz said.

Biographic sketches of some of the prominent people on President Clinton's list of pardons and commutations, issued Saturday before leaving office: COMMUTATION: LINDA SUE EVANS Evans, 53, was ordered in 1990 to serve five years for her role in a bombing conspiracy at the U.S. Capitol, after completing a 35-year term she was already serving for illegally buying firearms. Evans also pleaded guilty to conspiring to set off explosions at eight locations in a two-year campaign of ``armed propaganda'' to protest government policies. MELVIN REYNOLDS Reynolds, 47, a Chicago Democrat, resigned from the House after being convicted in 1995 of having sex with a teen-ager. He had more than two years left to serve on a 6 1/2-year federal sentence imposed after being convicted of lying to obtain loans and of illegally diverting campaign money for personal use. He had previously served 2 1/2 years of a five-year state sentence for having sexual relations with an underage campaign worker. ``He has suffered for his sins and it's time for him to get out,'' said Terry Gillespie, a lawyer who defended Reynolds on the state charges. SUSAN ROSENBERG In 1984, Rosenberg was found guilty of weapons possession and sentenced to 58 years in prison for her participation in the bungled 1981 Brink's armored car robbery that left two policemen and a guard dead in Rockland County, N.Y. She was also arrested in the 1983 Capitol bombing, but the charges were later dropped. In prison, Rosenberg has renounced all radical activity and been a model prisoner. PARDONED: WILLIAM A. BORDERS JR. The once-prominent Washington attorney and former president of the National Bar Association was convicted of conspiracy along with then-U.S. District Judge Alcee L. Hastings in a Miami racketeering case. While Hastings was acquitted, Borders was sentenced to a five-year prison term and disbarred. Borders was also held in contempt of court for refusing to testify during Hasting's criminal and Senate impeachment trials. HENRY CISNEROS Cisneros, 52, was housing secretary during Clinton's first term before moving to Los Angeles to run Univision, the nation's largest Spanish-language television network. In 1999, Cisneros pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor after a four-year, $9 million probe into charges he lied about payments to a former mistress. ROGER CLINTON Clinton's brother pleaded guilty in 1985 to a charge of conspiracy to distribute a single gram of cocaine. At the time of his arrest, he was ingesting five to seven grams of the drug each day. He served more than a year in prison. JOHN DEUTCH Deutch, 61, CIA director from May 1995 to December 1996, stored and processed hundreds of files of highly classified material on unprotected home computers that he and family members also used to connect to the Internet, according to an internal CIA investigation. The Defense Department's inspector general found similar conduct during Deutch's prior service at the Pentagon. Prosecutors offered Deutch a deal under which he would plead guilty to keeping government secrets on unsecured home computers and receive no prison time. WILLIAM FUGAZY SR. The one-time limousine mogul was a former confidant of New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and ex-New York Gov. Mario Cuomo. In 1997, Fugazy pleaded guilty to, after having gone bankrupt, shifting some of his remaining assets into another company controlled by his children, in order to avoid paying creditors who claimed he owed them $75 million. He was sentenced to two years of probation for committing perjury. PATRICIA HEARST Hearst, 45, was a 19-year-old newspaper heiress who was kidnapped by radicals in 1974 and convicted of joining them in a San Francisco bank heist. She claimed she was brainwashed by her Symbionese Liberation Army captors and forced to participate in the armed robbery. President Carter commuted her seven-year sentence after she had served 21 months. PETER MACDONALD MacDonald, 72, the former leader of the Navajo Nation, has been in a Fort Worth, Texas, medical prison since his 1992 sentencing for his role in a Window Rock, Ariz., riot that resulted in the deaths of two of his supporters in 1989. MacDonald was removed from office for taking bribes and kickbacks. The two supporters were killed on July 20, 1989, by tribal police during a march to protest what they considered a coup against their leader. MacDonald, his health deteriorating, has been serving a 14-year sentence for inciting the deadly riot. SUSAN MCDOUGAL McDougal, 46, spent 18 months in prison for refusing to testify against the Clinton regarding their Whitewater land dealings. Said her decision was based on a fear she would be charged with perjury unless she falsely implicated the Clintons of wrongdoing. MARC RICH The billionaire commodities trader was convicted in the early 1980s on 51 counts of conspiracy, tax evasion, racketeering and trading with the enemy. Before his trial, he fled to Switzerland to escape the charges. The Swiss have refused to extradite him.

Biographic sketches of some of the prominent people on President Clinton's list of pardons and commutations, issued Saturday before leaving office: COMMUTATION: LINDA SUE EVANS Evans, 53, was ordered in 1990 to serve five years for her role in a bombing conspiracy at the U.S. Capitol, after completing a 35-year term she was already serving for illegally buying firearms. Evans also pleaded guilty to conspiring to set off explosions at eight locations in a two-year campaign of ``armed propaganda'' to protest government policies. MELVIN REYNOLDS Reynolds, 47, a Chicago Democrat, resigned from the House after being convicted in 1995 of having sex with a teen-ager. He had more than two years left to serve on a 6 1/2-year federal sentence imposed after being convicted of lying to obtain loans and of illegally diverting campaign money for personal use. He had previously served 2 1/2 years of a five-year state sentence for having sexual relations with an underage campaign worker. ``He has suffered for his sins and it's time for him to get out,'' said Terry Gillespie, a lawyer who defended Reynolds on the state charges. SUSAN ROSENBERG In 1984, Rosenberg was found guilty of weapons possession and sentenced to 58 years in prison for her participation in the bungled 1981 Brink's armored car robbery that left two policemen and a guard dead in Rockland County, N.Y. She was also arrested in the 1983 Capitol bombing, but the charges were later dropped. In prison, Rosenberg has renounced all radical activity and been a model prisoner. PARDONED: WILLIAM A. BORDERS JR. The once-prominent Washington attorney and former president of the National Bar Association was convicted of conspiracy along with then-U.S. District Judge Alcee L. Hastings in a Miami racketeering case. While Hastings was acquitted, Borders was sentenced to a five-year prison term and disbarred. Borders was also held in contempt of court for refusing to testify during Hasting's criminal and Senate impeachment trials. HENRY CISNEROS Cisneros, 52, was housing secretary during Clinton's first term before moving to Los Angeles to run Univision, the nation's largest Spanish-language television network. In 1999, Cisneros pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor after a four-year, $9 million probe into charges he lied about payments to a former mistress. ROGER CLINTON Clinton's brother pleaded guilty in 1985 to a charge of conspiracy to distribute a single gram of cocaine. At the time of his arrest, he was ingesting five to seven grams of the drug each day. He served more than a year in prison. JOHN DEUTCH Deutch, 61, CIA director from May 1995 to December 1996, stored and processed hundreds of files of highly classified material on unprotected home computers that he and family members also used to connect to the Internet, according to an internal CIA investigation. The Defense Department's inspector general found similar conduct during Deutch's prior service at the Pentagon. Prosecutors offered Deutch a deal under which he would plead guilty to keeping government secrets on unsecured home computers and receive no prison time. WILLIAM FUGAZY SR. The one-time limousine mogul was a former confidant of New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and ex-New York Gov. Mario Cuomo. In 1997, Fugazy pleaded guilty to, after having gone bankrupt, shifting some of his remaining assets into another company controlled by his children, in order to avoid paying creditors who claimed he owed them $75 million. He was sentenced to two years of probation for committing perjury. PATRICIA HEARST Hearst, 45, was a 19-year-old newspaper heiress who was kidnapped by radicals in 1974 and convicted of joining them in a San Francisco bank heist. She claimed she was brainwashed by her Symbionese Liberation Army captors and forced to participate in the armed robbery. President Carter commuted her seven-year sentence after she had served 21 months. PETER MACDONALD MacDonald, 72, the former leader of the Navajo Nation, has been in a Fort Worth, Texas, medical prison since his 1992 sentencing for his role in a Window Rock, Ariz., riot that resulted in the deaths of two of his supporters in 1989. MacDonald was removed from office for taking bribes and kickbacks. The two supporters were killed on July 20, 1989, by tribal police during a march to protest what they considered a coup against their leader. MacDonald, his health deteriorating, has been serving a 14-year sentence for inciting the deadly riot. SUSAN MCDOUGAL McDougal, 46, spent 18 months in prison for refusing to testify against the Clinton regarding their Whitewater land dealings. Said her decision was based on a fear she would be charged with perjury unless she falsely implicated the Clintons of wrongdoing. MARC RICH The billionaire commodities trader was convicted in the early 1980s on 51 counts of conspiracy, tax evasion, racketeering and trading with the enemy. Before his trial, he fled to Switzerland to escape the charges. The Swiss have refused to extradite him.

Overwhelmed by grinding poverty and instability, the streets of this Central African capital buzzed Saturday with fears for the future under Joseph Kabila who is succeeding his assassinated father as president. Many see few differences between the new president and his father, Laurent Kabila, gunned down Tuesday in his palace after 3 1/2 years of steadily eroding rule. ``The father was a bad guy. The son will also be a bad guy. Everybody is suffering,'' said street vendor Elisabeth Ntumba, 55, as she waited for customers at a table scattered with some soap, a can of tomato paste, a few peanuts and meager wares she hawks to support her nine children. Life in the Congolese capital has steadily deteriorated in recent years. The country was left in ruins by the late dictator Mobutu Sese Seko, who became one of the world's richest men by plundering the vast mineral wealth of Africa's third-largest country. More than two years of civil war under Kabila only accelerated the country's economic slide. Though the fighting remains far away, Kinshasa has seen spiraling prices for food, education and health care that have many fed up and calling for change. ``There's a big deterioration, day by day,'' said Mbinge-Mbinge Devos, a 25-year-old university student. ``There is no progress in life. People are staying in the same place. There are no jobs. Life is very tough.'' Many doubt that Joseph Kabila, whose character and political beliefs are virtually unknown, can deliver the turnaround the country sorely needs. Some simply want the young president to emerge from the cloak of secrecy that surrounded his father's rule and declare a new course for the country. ``If he finds solutions to the problems, then he can stay,'' said Philippe Efihli, 46. ``If not, then he must go.'' Efihli is feeling the crunch of inflation. A few years ago all five of his children were enrolled in school. Now his weekly salary of $3.60 and the supplementary income his wife makes selling homegrown vegetables is only enough to educate two children. ``The country is not going very well. Eating is a problem,'' Efihli said. ``We have never had a good leader.'' Many families survive only because they grow maize, cassava and other vegetables on plots near their homes. Meat is such a rarity that Tony Costa, a 25-year-old university student, plans to slaughter his pet monkey for food in April, when it has grown bigger. ``Before, buying meat was not a problem,'' he said. ``Now, I only eat vegetables.'' Costa has little hope that the younger Kabila will bring change, stating flatly that ``the insecurity will not end tomorrow.'' Some point to their new leader's age _ Joseph is said to be around 30 years old, but his exact date of birth is a mystery. Others criticize his ethnicity _ his mother is rumored to be a Tutsi, the dominant ethnic group in Rwanda, who are widely despised by the Congolese. And even worse is a leadership succession that smacks of royalty. ``Congo is not a kingdom where the son must take over,'' Devos said. The elder Kabila led a rebellion that overthrew the decades-long rule of Mobutu in 1997. One year later, he in turn faced a rebellion launched by Congolese Tutsis, disaffected Congolese soldiers and opposition politicians with the support of Rwanda and Uganda _ his former allies. Fighting continues, despite a cease-fire signed by all sides, and Kabila has demonstrated no inclination to end the hostilities. Ntumba, the street vendor, is praying that changes. ``We need peace. I'm praying for peace,'' she said. ``If there is war, we will die.''

Susan McDougal, who served time for fraud convictions stemming from the failed Whitewater land deal, said Saturday that President Clinton's pardon reinforced her assertion that she is innocent. In one of his final acts as president, Clinton pardoned 140 people, including three other people convicted during investigations linked to Whitewater: former Whitewater real estate agent Chris Wade, university professor Stephen A. Smith, and former Madison Guaranty appraiser Robert W. Palmer. Not on the list were McDougal's former husband, James McDougal, who was convicted in the same 1996 trial and died while serving his prison sentence; former Gov. Jim Guy Tucker, who was convicted with the McDougals, and Webster Hubbell, a former law partner of Hillary Rodham Clinton and Justice Department official. A jury convicted Susan McDougal, a former business partner of the Clintons, of four counts of fraud in a 1996 trial. She served 18 months for contempt for refusing to answer questions about Clinton, then three months of a two-year sentence on the fraud convictions before being sentenced to time served and released because of health problems. ``I am so grateful,'' McDougal said Saturday in a telephone interview from a friend's house in Arkadelphia. ``There are tears down my face right now. I don't think I stopped crying since I saw the announcement.'' Tucker served 18 months' home detention for the 1996 convictions, but still has appeals pending in the case. Hubbell, who was a law partner of Hillary Rodham Clinton at the Rose Law firm in Little Rock, pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 21 months in federal prison over his billing practices at the firm. He did not seek a pardon. Until word of her pardon arrived, McDougal said she was uncertain whether Clinton would grant her clemency. ``It might have been human nature to hold some anger toward me because the investigation had to do with business dealings my husband and I had with them,'' McDougal said. She said the pardon lifted a burden she'd carried since she was first investigated in 1986. ``I wasn't guilty. It's a horrible thing going through your life knowing you are innocent,'' McDougal said. ``This is a wonderful lifting of that stone that I had carried a long time.'' Although Wade was a salesman for Whitewater, his felony charges were unrelated to the business. He pleaded guilty in March 1995 to bankruptcy fraud and making a false statement to a bank. He served 13 months of a 15-month prison term. ``Being a felon, I couldn't even go squirrel hunting. I couldn't vote and I couldn't run for public office, which is about the last thing I considered doing,'' he said. For Clinton, he had nothing but kind words. ``I think he did a great job and I have absolutely no animosity toward Clinton whatsoever,'' he said. Smith, a communications professor at the University of Arkansas, pleaded guilty in June 1995 to misdemeanor conspiracy to misapply the funds of a loan from a government-backed lending company. He was sentenced to a year of probation, 100 hours of community service, and fined $1,000. Reached while judging a debate tournament at Arkansas Tech University in Russellville, Smith said only, ``If they want to pardon someone, let them pardon Ken Starr. He's the only criminal in this whole thing.'' Starr was the independent counsel throughout most of the Whitewater investigation, and had sought many of the convictions. Palmer pleaded guilty in December 1994 to a felony count of conspiracy to file false appraisals for Madison Guaranty Savings and Loan. He was sentenced to a year of home detention, three years probation, and fined $5,000. Palmer could be reached Saturday for comment. McDougal said she would continue as an advocate for women in prison, pushing for improved living conditions. She said she likely would get involved in politics. ``I'll be working for any Democrat who wants to run for president,'' she said.

Congo's crumbling capital on Sunday received the body of its slain president, Laurent Kabila, four years after his rebel army was welcomed for ousting the late dictator Mobutu Sese Seko. The casket arrived in Kinshasa around 12:30 p.m. in a presidential plane flying from Kabila's southwestern home city of Lubumbashi. In preparation for a public memorial ceremony planned later in the day, palm fronds were draped as a symbol of mourning across car windshields and in front of shops and hotels. Thin crowds lined the main road leading from the airport into city, although few people showed any emotion as they waited for a glimpse of the funeral procession. After taking power in a rebel march across this sweeping Central African nation in May 1997, Kabila was initially hailed by the people of Kinshasa as a hero. Those feelings were soon replaced by resentment as his corrupt grip on power began to resemble Mobutu, the 30-year dictator that he toppled. There were some signs that Congolese authorities were taking no chances that Kabila's unpopularity would mar Sunday's memorial ceremony. A heavy military presence was staked out at the open-air Palace of the People, where the service was to be held. At intersections and marketplaces, soldiers violently confiscated necklaces and earrings from a number of women, arguing that jewelry was disrespectful during a 30-day mourning period, witnesses said on condition of anonymity. Journalists saw three women running from a market with ears bleeding. At the Simba Zikida marketplace in southeast Kinshasa, shopowners were commanded by local authorities to attend Sunday's service, witnesses said. ``They cannot force people to mourn. Even if it were my own father I would not accept it,'' said one shopper, who identified herself as Honorine. ``But I'm afraid the soldiers will make trouble against the people.'' It was not known if Kabila's son, Joseph, who was quickly installed as the new president, would attend Sunday's memorial. The younger Kabila did not appear at a public ceremony held a day earlier in the family's home city of Lubumbashi, 1,000 miles east of Kinshasa. Laurent Kabila spent most of his 3 1/2 years in power in Lubumbashi, exemplifying his government's shaky grip on power in Congo _ torn by a civil war that has drawn in armies from several nations in the region. Details of the palace shooting remain murky. Justice Minister Mwenze Kongolo said Saturday that Kabila was shot Tuesday by a bodyguard while he sat at his desk. The assassin, now dead, approached the president as if to tell him something and shot him once behind the ear and then twice in the stomach, Kongolo said. At least one presidential guardsman was arrested Friday in connection with the assassination, another guard said Sunday on condition of anonymity. Several other soldiers were reportedly arrested earlier. Zambian President Frederik Chiluba, a sometime peace negotiator between Congo's warring sides, on Sunday said the circumstances of Kabila's death ``have yet again cast a dark shadow on the rule of law in our continent.'' ``This is a tragedy for the Democratic Republic of Congo which has been desperately searching for and has not known peace and stability in the past two years,'' Chiluba said. Rebels have been fighting Kabila's government since 1998, backed by troops from Rwanda and Uganda. Kabila has been supported by Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia. The presidents of Kabila's three foreign allies were expected to meet on Sunday for talks in Luanda, Angola, according to Zimbabwean officials. The Rwandan army said Saturday that its positions in southeastern Congo were briefly fired upon by government forces, the first attack since Kabila's death. There were no casualties reported.

President Joseph Estrada's departure from office this past weekend and the swearing-in of Vice President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo to replace him brought a peaceful end to the Philippines' worst political crisis since the strongman Ferdinand Marcos was driven from office in 1986. Estrada, who was accused of widespread corruption, stepped down on Saturday, after top aides and military officials withdrew their support for him, and tens of thousands of protesters took to the streets in what is being viewed as a resurgence of the ``people power'' revolution that ousted Marcos. At church services, shopping malls, restaurants and street stalls across Manila, the mood on Sunday was upbeat and the talk centered on the pivotal role that huge public demonstrations played in Estrada's exit. Speaking at a downtown Mass attended by several thousand people, Arroyo praised the country's young people, who made up the vast majority of the demonstrators. ``I will strive to give you a bright future,'' said Arroyo, an economist turned politician. At the same Mass, the Roman Catholic cardinal, Jaime Sin, the nation's spiritual leader, said the country was like a newborn child and admonished Filipinos to remain vigilant. ``We must never allow the mistakes of the past to best us again,'' he said. Down the street at Rose's Coffeehouse, Christy Garcia, a secretary, said Filipinos had ``taken control of their destiny.'' But Estrada left office without being prosecuted, despite compelling evidence against him, which was suppressed at his Senate impeachment trial. And that was proof for many here that 15 years after the end of the notorious graft-filled Marcos years, the Philippines was still far from conquering corruption, and real democracy remained elusive. ``This will be a very hollow victory if Estrada, his cronies, and the senators who tried to cover up his crimes are allowed to walk away free,'' said Bill Luz, executive director of the Makati Business Club, an organization of the country's largest corporations. ``Unless we have some fundamental change in our system of government, including greater transparency and accountability, there will be more Joseph Estradas.'' Aquilino Pimentel, the former president of the Senate, said that bribes, payoffs, kickbacks and nepotism were endemic across all sectors of the Philippines and that cracking down on corruption and strengthening the economy should be the top priorities of the new administration. ``Those in the highest levels of government take the biggest slice of the corruption pie,'' said Pimentel, who resigned last week after 11 senators from Estrada's party blocked the presentation of evidence that impeachment prosecutors said would prove Estrada had illegally amassed millions of dollars. ``We have to show that nobody is above the law. If we don't, then everyday people will justify their own corruption by saying, `If the leaders are doing it, why can't I?'' Estrada's two and a half years in power were marked by a series of embarrassing scandals. There were accusations that Estrada, a movie actor, had poor work habits, and charges that he took bribes from illegal gambling syndicates, siphoned off government funds, and protected friends involved in illegal activities from prosecution. In her first full day as president, Arroyo met with opposition leaders and began choosing her Cabinet and formulating policy, her aides said. In her first executive action, Arroyo _ whose father, Diosdado Macapagal, was president in the 1960s _ plans to prohibit all government agencies from doing business with her family, the aides said. In a sign that the economy is one of her priorities, Arroyo's first Cabinet appointment was that of finance minister, for which she chose Alberto Romulo, a former senator. He said in an interview Sunday that he would try to regain the confidence of jittery foreign investors, who abandoned Philippine financial markets in droves because of the country's political uncertainty. Romulo also said he would tighten the country's fiscal controls and crack down on tax evaders by reorganizing the internal revenue and customs departments. Romulo said he expected the actions to bring in hundreds of millions of dollars a year in lost revenues. Initially, Arroyo is expected to spend much of her time consolidating the power base that swept her into the presidency. It was an extremely broad-based coalition, including the military, opposition parties, the church, human rights groups, and business interests. Her greatest debt will be to the armed forces, whose support was crucial to convincing Estrada to step down. While the military has shown no signs of late that it would intervene directly in the country's politics, political analysts said the shadow of a coup continued to loom large in the Philippines.

President Vicente Fox took power promising nothing less than a second Mexican revolution. Seven weeks later, reality is setting in. If Fox wants to be more than a cheerleader for change, he must persuade a recalcitrant Congress, dominated by his opponents, to pass new laws and amend the constitution. And the old guard is putting up resistance, right and left. This is the new politics of Mexico, which Fox helped create: the rough-and-tumble of democracy. Each of the new president's first big proposals _ to transform Mexico's electric grid with help from abroad, rewrite the tax code and guarantee rights for 10 million Indians _ represents the struggle between what Mexico was in the 20th century and what Fox wants it to become in the 21st. But Mexico's constitution all but forbids foreign investment in electricity production. Political and popular opposition to tax reform is fierce. Some members of the old ruling party say that granting even limited autonomy to Mexico's Indians would be the death of the nation. And all signs are that in Congress, the Institutional Revolutionary Party, known as the PRI, which ran Mexico for seven decades, and the left-leaning Party of the Democratic Revolution may block these big initiatives. For 70 years, a Congress led by the governing party rubber-stamped the proposals of the all-powerful presidents. Now things are different, as Fox acknowledged in his Dec. 1 inaugural address: ``The president proposes; Congress disposes,'' he said, quoting an old saw of American politics. ``He's going to run into a wall with this Congress, which has its own authority, if he tries to abuse his power,'' warned Marti Batres, the Party of the Democratic Revolution's leader in the lower house of Congress. No party now holds a majority in Congress, which was elected, like Fox, in July. Nothing can pass if supported solely by members of Fox's National Action Party, which holds 46 of 128 Senate seats and 207 of 500 seats in the lower house, the Chamber of Deputies. And no coalitions are coming together. The PRI, bloodied but unbowed by Fox's election, still holds a plurality _ 60 seats in the Senate and 211 in the Chamber. Its national leader, Dulce Maria Sauri, insists it is ``not just the party of opposition, but the party of choice'' in Mexico. And it looks as if the party will choose to oppose Fox at nearly every turn. For the left-leaning Party of the Democratic Revolution, ideology is the issue when it fights in the name of workers and the poor against Fox's pro-business policies. But for the long-governing party, it is power. Its leaders hope that if Fox fails to deliver on his big promises, the party could win back the presidency six years from now. It has already attacked his schemes for rewiring Mexico's electric grid and imposing new taxes. And few predict the party will embrace Indian rights when hundreds of Zapatista rebels march from the jungles of Chiapas to the capital to begin peace talks in six weeks. Five days after his inauguration, Fox formally asked Congress to approve accords reached four years ago between the government and the Zapatistas, but never enacted. They would let all Indian communities make local laws and elect local officials through village meetings, give them ``equitable access to the distribution of national wealth'' and grant them land rights they have effectively lost. The measure is a constitutional change, requiring a two-thirds vote in Congress. The Senate president, Enrique Jackson, a PRI leader, flatly says the party will oppose it. Without the party's votes, the accords cannot pass, and the peace talks probably will be doomed. Then there is Fox's move to impose a 15 percent tax on food and medicine _ perhaps the most unpopular measure he has proposed so far. In the United States, taxes are 30 percent of the gross domestic product; in Mexico, only 11 percent. If that rose to 15 or 20 percent, Fox could increase spending on the basics _ schools, roads, poverty _ while balancing the budget. Tax avoidance in Mexico is widespread. Many rich people and small businesses simply pay nothing. As much as a third of the economy is off the books. Tackling tax evasion would be an enormous task and would take years to accomplish. So Fox and his advisers believe the quickest and easiest way to increase revenues is to tax most types of food and medicine. But Congress will not go along. Most members won't even discuss it, Batres of the Party of the Democratic Revolution says. ``The two parties are clearly opposed,'' said Miroslava Garcia, the economic policy chief in the lower house for the Party of the Democratic Revolution, which holds 15 seats in the Senate and 52 in the lower house. ``I don't see how President Fox can advance it alone.'' The PRI's fiscal chief in Congress, Jorge Chavez Presa, is openly dismissive of the tax plan and the thinking behind it. ``It's a new administration, with stars in its eyes,'' he said. ``If Fox insists on presenting this type of proposal, it will be a total failure.'' The plan has been denounced by everyone from a coalition of pharmacy owners to Catholic prelates; the archbishop of Jalapa, Sergio Obeso Rivera, called it barbaric. The person in the street is unenthusiastic, too. ``Toothpaste, you can tax toothpaste, that's one thing, but medicine is quite another,'' said Beatriz Vergara Espinosa, 33, who works in a Mexico City insurance office. Her boss, Guadalupe Bello Morin, 46, agreed. ``I'm sure the government can find something else to tax,'' she said. ``There are a lot of people in this country evading taxes. We pay, but they don't.'' Mexico's economy, in a long, slow but fairly steady recovery from the disastrous peso crash of 1995, may survive and even thrive without new taxes. But without new sources of electrical power, it might not. Since 1995, demand for electricity has been growing 6 percent to 8 percent a year, power production by 1 percent or 2 percent. Tens of billions of dollars must be invested in new plants to meet the need. Mexico cannot afford that, Fox says, so it must turn to foreign investors to build them. The problem is that Mexico's constitution gives the government exclusive power to produce energy, as a point of national pride. ``With electricity, the only way to capture the interest of investors is by modifying the constitution and removing state exclusivity,'' said Juan Camilo Mourino, a member of the lower house from the National Action Party and chairman of the chamber's energy commission. Fox proposes to change the constitution to let private companies generate electricity, without selling off government power plants or transmission networks to private companies. Today, the federal government spends $3.5 billion a year subsidizing electricity for domestic use, paying 13 cents to produce each kilowatt-hour, but selling it to people for 6 cents. Fox intends to pit government production against private companies, selling electricity at the lowest cost on an open market. But his predecessor, President Ernesto Zedillo, tried privatizing electricity in 1999 and ran into a brick wall. Not even his own party supported him; with an election looming, it ducked the issue. The left remains opposed on the ground that private investment will be ``the death of a public service,'' said Maria del Rosario Tapi Media, a Chamber of Deputies member. Fox may have better luck if the old ruling party will cut a deal with him. ``Fox's electricity proposal is less radical than Zedillo's,'' said Agustin Basave, the head of the political science department at the Technical Institute of Monterrey. ``But getting it passed is going to depend on Fox's relationship with the PRI. The PRI is not going to give its support for free.''

Anna Kournikova says it ``feels like yesterday'' that she last made the quarterfinals at a Grand Slam. Even if the gap was 3 1/2 years. ``Time flies, huh!'' Kournikova said after reaching the quarterfinals at the Australian Open. The last time she made it this deep into a major was the summer of 1997, when she was a semifinalist at Wimbledon. Kournikova advanced to the Australian Open quarters Sunday with a 6-3, 6-1 win over unseeded Barbara Rittner. She now faces Lindsay Davenport, the defending titlist and No. 2 seed. ``Me and Lindsay, we've had some tough matches ... (but) I have a good record against her. I've beaten her a few times,'' Kournikova said. ``I'm not playing at my best right now but I will go out there and fight as much as I can _ we'll see what happens.'' Davenport, a winner of three Grand Slam titles and a gold medal at the 1996 Olympics, has a 5-3 lead in head-to-head play against Kournikova, including a 6-2, 6-2 sweep in the fourth round of the Australian Open a year ago. A singles title still eludes Kournikova, although she finished 1998 as the world's No. 1-ranked doubles player and lifted the Australian Open doubles crown with Martina Hingis the following year. Kournikova burst onto the pro tour by making the fourth round at the U.S. Open in 1996. The following year, as a 16-year-old, she became only the second woman in the Open era to reach the semis on her debut at Wimbledon; Chris Evert was the first in 1972. At Wimbledon, she upset No. 5 seed Iva Majoli in the quarters and No. 10 Anke Huber in the third round after rallying from match point down in the second round against Rittner. Rittner almost took revenge Sunday, running Kournikova all around the court to take a 3-1 lead. But Kournikova calmed herself and, after breaking back, held serve to level at 3-3 when she picked up a low half-volley and produced a forehand winner down the line. The sixth game had gone to deuce nine times. She broke Rittner at love in the next game and dominated the remainder of the match. ``I'm definitely happy with the result, and it's great to be playing so well at a Grand Slam again,'' she said. Kournikova has made the fourth round at a Grand Slam on seven occasions, each time losing to a seeded player. At Melbourne Park, she said she finally got the luck of the draw. ``Every time I got to the fourth round, I wasn't really seeded or I always played higher-ranked players,'' she said. ``I lost to Lindsay here before, Mary (Pierce) and Martina (Hingis) and so I've always lost to the players that were, you know, either winners or got far.'' Davenport, who beat No. 15-seeded Kim Clijsters 6-4, 6-0, said she was starting to feel excited going into the second week and anticipated a difficult clash against Kournikova. ``Getting through the round of 16 is a big round _ now you know that the really tough matches are here,'' she said.

President Clinton may have heeded federal prosecutors' pleas to deny Michael Milken a pardon, but the financier's case is unlikely to fade completely. The man who built Wall Street's junk bond market continues to spend much of his wealth on cancer research and other charitable causes. Milken takes quick offense at suggestions that his philanthropic activities, which moved into high gear after his release from prison in 1993, are an attempt to restore his public image or win a pardon. And he has many friends to argue his case. ``I've never met anyone who was more passionate about truly making the world a better place for people to live, as corny as that may sound,'' Ted Virtue, a Milken colleague at Drexel and president of Deutsche Bank Securities, said. ``I don't think it's a facade.'' Milken pleaded guilty to six counts of security fraud in 1990 and was barred from the securities business for life. In 1995, federal authorities began investigating Milken again, soon after it became public that Milken received a fee of $50 million for helping to broker Time Warner's purchase of Turner Broadcasting. The SEC sued Milken in February 1998 for violating his pledge not to re-enter the securities business. Without admitting to or denying the allegations, Milken agreed to repay $47 million in brokerage fees. As President Clinton prepared to hand over office, he was considering scores of pardon requests, including one on Milken's behalf. Milken and his family have given more than $750 million away over the past 30 years, according to a Milken spokesman. Much of it is channeled through the Milken Family Foundation, founded in 1982, which funds education and medical research, especially in the area of cancer. Several Milken family members have suffered from cancer. Only days after his release from a federal prison, after serving 22 months of a 10-year sentence for securities fraud, Milken was diagnosed with prostate cancer, which is now in remission. He responded by launching CaP CURE, an association to fund cancer research into the deadly disease. Milken, 54, is also chairman of the Milken Institute, a nonprofit think tank, and Knowledge Universe, a for-profit company that invests in a variety of young companies. Samuel Broder, a former head of the National Cancer Institute who now is vice president of Celera Genomics, said Milken's efforts have accelerated research into prostate cancer and other diseases and had a lasting impact on the careers of many scientists. ``He fostered a lot of research activity that would not have gotten done otherwise,'' Broder said. Federal officials acknowledge his charitable activities, but have argued that they should not overshadow the harm they say he has done to the country's financial markets. Richard Walker, enforcement director of the Securities and Exchange Commission, wrote the White House opposing a presidential pardon saying, ``Few people have done more than Milken to undermine public confidence in our markets.'' Walker also wrote, ``Philanthropy cannot provide a license to violate the law.'' Milken's misconduct during the 1990s, Walker said, showed Milken's ``continuing contempt for the law and discredits any claim that he has learned from his mistakes and has been rehabilitated.'' Friends and associates of Milken reject the notion that Milken used his philanthropy as a shield for illegal activities or wants a pardon so he can resume his securities activities. Geoffrey Moore, senior vice president of Knowledge Universe and Milken's spokesman, said Milken is not planning a return to high finance should he be pardoned. ``He feels he has more than a lifetime's worth of work in his medical research and education initiatives,'' Moore said. Wall Street observers generally agree that Milken made lasting contributions to the financial markets. They differ on whether those achievements, along with his philanthropy, merit a pardon. ``Michael Milken helped bring many companies to market that otherwise would not have been able to,'' said Alan Shapiro, a professor of banking and finance at the Marshall School of Business at the University of Southern California. Shapiro believes Milken may have angered investment bankers, corporate leaders and federal regulators with his aggressive tactics, prompting authorities to make him an example. ``If it had been anyone other than Milken, he wouldn't have been prosecuted,'' he said. ``At best, he should have had civil, not criminal, penalties imposed.'' A presidential pardon may change Milken's legal status, but it is unlikely to change many minds. ``Milken was a crook. He pleaded guilty to felony counts,'' said Mark Eaker, a professor of business administration at the Darden Graduate School of Business at the University of Virginia. ``Regardless of what else he has or hasn't done or what you think of him, that's a fact.''

Officials and volunteers for the Galapagos Biological Marine Reserve raced against the clock and nature Sunday to try to keep an oil spill of an estimated 144,000 gallons from turning into an environmental disaster. The Ecuadorean tanker Jessica, loaded with 240,000 gallons of oil, rammed into a reef on Tuesday night 800 yards off San Cristobal Island, part of the Galapagos. Crews were able to transfer several thousand gallons of oil off the ship before its cargo hold cracked on Friday night and started oozing fuel into the Pacific. Officials said the most recent aerial surveillance showed an oil slick spread intermittently over an area of 270 to 300 square miles. ``The situation is very, very severe,'' Environment Minister Rodolfo Rendon said from San Cristobal Island, where he is directing operations. ``The cleanup is going to take weeks, and we'll need all the national and international help we can get.'' The Jessica was carrying diesel fuel and fuel oil on a regular supply run to the islands. Early attempts to corral the spill with floating barriers failed, and the first signs of trouble are being registered in the islands' delicate ecosystem, which inspired Darwin's theory of evolution. ``We already have one dead lava gull that has been brought into the station,'' said Maria Eugenia Proano, who is in charge of the Charles Darwin Research Station's operations on San Cristobal. Other animals coated with oil were reported to have been taken there by volunteers. While the islands may be better known for their tortoises and seals, birds are the most sensitive to fuel spills, experts said. Bird species that are native to the area and rare include the lava gull, the Galapagos penguin and the world's last land-bound seabird, the flightless cormorant. While the slick has already reached the shores of some islands, forecasters expect it to spread on the back of an expected swell. ``I don't think there's a person out there that really knows how big the spill is or exactly where it's going,'' said Fernando Espinoza, the Darwin Foundation's secretary general. ``All we can say right now is that it is out of control.'' The islands, about 600 miles west of mainland Ecuador, are an international symbol of conservation and a haven for nature lovers. The Galapagos National Park has been a United Nations World Heritage site since 1979 and attracts about 50,000 tourists a year. The government has been in talks to have the 86,800-square-mile Biological Marine Reserve in the park included in the heritage site. What makes the Galapagos unique, experts say, is that they still have 96 percent of their endemic biodiversity intact. Brigades of volunteers have been sent to beaches to bring injured animals to impromptu veterinary stations. The California-based Bird Rescue Research Center is also sending a team of experts this week. Although park officials have been focusing their stretched resources on endemic and endangered species, volunteers have placed a fence around a nearby colony of sea lions to keep them from entering the water. Officials on the scene said the Ecuadorean Navy was working around the clock to try to remove the remaining 6,000 to 10,000 gallons of fuel in the ship's hull before the boat breaks up or collapses. About 50 percent of the boat is underwater, and it is listing at least 45 degrees, which has complicated the procedure, officials said. President Gustavo Noboa said there would be a full investigation of the accident.

It took about nine years, including a surreal streak of 13 straight losses, before the stubborn Todd Martin finally applied his epiphany to the court against Pete Sampras. Long ago, he had had the ``aha'' moment. Martin knew the only way to approach Sampras was to stare him down in a game of chicken. He had just never had the will to do it before Sunday evening at the Australian Open. For an entire match, Martin just kept coming, jamming Sampras with serves into his body, taking big swipes at second-serve opportunities and forcing the third-seeded legend to pass him with his backhand. It was victory or bust. And the plan was executed to near perfection as Martin, who has had spotlight moments unravel on him before, held on to his nerve to defeat an unsteady Sampras, 6-7 (2), 6-3, 6-4, 6-4, advancing to a quarterfinal match against Andre Agassi. ``I think I was sold a bill of goods, and I was fortunate enough to believe it,'' said Martin, who had been told repeatedly by his coaches to dictate the match. ``Every time I've ever played Pete, I kept on making adjustments along the way rather than sticking to my guns and having a shoot-out with him. Today, I finally stuck to my guns.'' He was almost flawless. With neat and crisp volleys, with a first serve that splashed down on target, Martin exited the court after committing only 12 unforced errors in the face of the player who has been his career demon. Before the Round of 16 match, Sampras held a gaudy 17-2 record against Martin. And the 30-year-old sage had not beaten Sampras since 1995. ``You know, nothing feels better than to know that I did something today that I've never done before,'' Martin said. ``I don't feel like I was very committed to doing it the right way before; and today, I did it the right way. If I would have lost, I still would have felt pretty good about it.'' Sampras looked helpless to stop Martin. Sampras didn't complain about the blisters on his feet, but his mobility appeared restricted. As usual, Sampras' tongue was hanging out and his shoulders were slumped but he usually has a little burst in reserve for the big points. This time, he was out of heroics. Never quite finding the edge on his wicked service game this week, Sampras quietly departed after four matches filled with uncommon struggle. ``I didn't feel like I played poorly,'' Sampras said. ``I feel like I played fine. He just served huge. He always got the first serve in. I always felt I was under pressure in my service games. He just played better than I did today. ``I felt fine physically. I got through some tough matches and I felt like if I could get my game going today, possibly get into the second week, I could be dangerous.'' The Sampras threat was over, though. He had company on his way out of town. On Sunday, a handful of other brand names gathered their things, as well, including second-seeded Marat Safin and eighth-seeded Tim Henman. A tempestuous Safin slammed his rackets and created a couple of scenes but didn't have the energy to fluster the 14th-seeded Dominik Hrbaty, who won, 6-2, 7-6 (6), 6-4. Unusually slow-footed and visibly timid, Safin could not get himself together long enough to extend a rally before delivering one of his 47 unforced errors. ``I didn't move him at all,'' Safin said. ``The guy, he wouldn't sweat. He was very comfortable from the baseline because I was making all the work. I was making unforced errors. He was much better than me. ``If you don't have confidence, you cannot play. I had no confidence at all. I was playing from the baseline, which is my best game, but I was afraid all the time. I was afraid to hit the ball.'' Henman couldn't have been too at ease, either. Inside Rod Laver Arena, packed with percolating Aussies, Henman hardly stood a chance against the resident folk hero, Patrick Rafter, who lit up the crowd with a 6-2, 6-3, 6-3 victory. For the first time in his career, Rafter advanced to the quarterfinals of his home-based major in what will likely be his last season on the Tour. Almost as a going-away present, the barrier to his route through the draw was lifted. ``I looked across the net and went, `Oh, finally,''' Rafter said. ``It was a relief as much as it was exciting for me. I was very, very satisfied.'' Martin had that look, as well. He didn't explode with a celebration on match point when Sampras mishandled another serve into the body. Instead, he was subdued after defeating his nemesis and friend. More than anything, Martin looked at peace. For all of Martin's miracle comebacks, there have been some memorable occasions when he has failed to tie up a majors match that he controlled. In 1996, on Wimbledon's Center Court, Martin's composure turned to dust against MaliVai Washington, losing after taking a 5-1 lead in the fifth set. Last year, he had Agassi buried beneath a 5-2 deficit before allowing him to escape at Wimbledon, too. ``That wasn't the greatest experience for me,'' Martin said. ``I lost a match I had a great chance to win. It's not the first time that has happened. ``That memory is gone as far as anything other than realizing that it can happen and to try to be better prepared for it. If my rematch comes with Andre in Memphis, Tenn., or Melbourne, Australia, it's fine. It has nothing to do with him. It has something to do with me. Today, I proved to myself that I could serve out a match.''

For the last eight years, whenever Bill Clinton wanted to go somewhere _ even out for a cup of coffee _ it turned into a production of armored limousines, vans, ambulances, helicopters, national security advisers, press aides and squads of Secret Service agents carrying submachine guns. On Sunday morning, when the former president of the United States decided to leave his new white house in the snow-covered suburbs of New York to pick up a cup of coffee for his wife and an egg salad sandwich for himself, the trappings of his short trip suggested how much his position in life has changed. He arrived at Lange's Little Store, across the street from a Grand Union supermarket, in a motorcade of precisely two cars. There was not a helicopter or machine gun in sight. ``It must be a slow news day in New York if you have to cover me,'' Clinton declared, chuckling at the sight of the reporters _ a fairly small bunch, if truth be told, compared with the old White House crowd _ who had come out to chronicle his first day as a private citizen. The former president, in a chatty mood and presumably enjoying the free time he now has on his hands, said he and Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton had spent the morning unpacking books and boxes. Clinton said he had not read the Sunday newspapers, which were filled with accounts of the inauguration of his successor, President Bush, or watched the Sunday morning talk shows, though he insisted that he never watched those anyway. When one of his new neighbors asked whether he had slept after what turned out to be a rather eventful last week in office, Clinton responded, ``Like a rock.'' ``So far, it's been wonderful,'' he said, offering an early report on life outside the White House. Not that he was able to quite leave his White House years behind him. Clinton defended his last-day-in-office granting of 140 pardons and said that he and his advisers were studying the way the pardon process was handled, with the intention of presenting a memo of recommendations to Bush on how to handle future applications for pardons. ``As long as we live in a world where you never vote again or have full citizenship restored to you unless you get a pardon, then the word `pardon' is somehow almost a misnomer,'' Clinton said. ``You're not saying these people didn't commit an offense. You're saying they paid, they paid in full, and they've been out long enough after their sentence to show they are good citizens.'' At Lange's, Clinton's arrival on this cold morning set off a frenzy of, well, presidential proportions. Local residents lined up and clamored to shake his hand, or pose for pictures, or get an autograph. (When someone sought to get Clinton to sign a $10 bill, he shook his head, saying, ``No money.'') Grabbing his hand, Sandy Nuffer said, ``I wish you could still be our president!'' Clinton responded: ``It was an honor to serve. Thank you.'' He did not respond when someone shouted, ``Hillary in four years?'' Some people were not quite as taken by the celebrity in their midst. Kathleen McAvoy of Mahopac pressed a piece of paper and a pen into the hand of her daughter, saying, ``Don't you want to have a president's signature?'' Her daughter, Siobhan, 11, responded firmly, ``He is not a president.'' Her mother replied, ``He was a president.'' Siobhan got her autograph. Hillary Clinton stayed at home during her husband's outing. But a few moments before the former president arrived, Chelsea Clinton, 20, slipped into the deli with no retinue or fanfare. She stood almost unnoticed at the deli counter, until people standing around realized, one by one, who she was. Without exception, they stopped and stared. ``This is history,'' Jay Schlesinger, a psychologist, whispered urgently to his wife. Chelsea Clinton then greeted people in the store, and used the honorific ``Mr.'' to address even reporters who had covered her parents. When one suggested that that level of formality was not necessary, the former president's daughter demurred. ``I may live in New York, but I'm still from the South,'' she said. For his part, Clinton seemed to be enjoying himself as much as he always did, stretching out the reception for nearly 20 minutes. ``Like your red shoes!'' he told one girl. And when one more person expressed regrets that his years in Washington were over, he smiled appreciatively and said: ``No one gets to stay forever. And it's better to leave when someone wants you.'' With that, William Jefferson Clinton dug into a brown paper bag to retrieve his egg salad sandwich, climbed back in his two-car motorcade, and headed to the place that he is now calling home.

Bitter fighting raged Monday in Afghanistan's central Bamiyan province for control of Yakaolang, a key town located at the crossroads of north and south Afghanistan. Opposition troops led by ousted president Burhanuddin Rabbani said they had recaptured the town from the ruling Taliban militia. There was no immediate comment from Taliban officials. The Taliban, who espouse a harsh brand of Islamic law, rule roughly 95 percent of Afghanistan and the opposition the remaining 5 percent. On Sunday, they denied U.N. allegations Sunday that their troops executed 100 civilians after capturing Yakaolang, an area largely inhabited by the country's minority Shiite Muslims. U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said Friday the United Nations had received information that Taliban soldiers summarily executed the civilians. The area is home to ethnic Hazaras, who are mostly Shiites. The Taliban _ and most others Afghanis _ are overwhelmingly Sunni Muslims and Pashtun. Meanwhile, the Taliban have begun recalling their foreign diplomats in keeping with new United Nations sanctions imposed to force them to hand over suspected terrorist leader Osama bin Laden. Under the sanctions, the Taliban have to reduce their missions in the three countries that recognize their government _ Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Pakistan. The sanctions also impose an arms embargo on the Taliban, who are said to be getting their supplies from neighboring Pakistan. The embargo does not apply to the opposition, which reportedly gets its weapons from Russia, several Central Asian states and Iran. The United Nations has announced it would make an exception to new limits on Afghanistan's national airlines, Ariana, to fly ailing children to Germany for treatment. Afghanistan's own medical facilities have been largely destroyed by 20 years of relentless war.

an oil spill off the coast of south america, along the galapagos island chain has clean-up crews scrambling to contain the spill and save rare wildlife. annabel roberts reports. the oil has leaked from the ship that ran aground half a mile off the shore of the protected galapagos islands. in just two days, more than 150,000 gallons of diesel have spilled into the sea. locals have tried to contain the slick with floating barriers but it has already spread to nearby beaches affecting the wildlife. environmentalists are trying to clean the oil from scene birds that have been contaminated. officials estimate the slick now covers almost 390 square miles of sea. the island's a home to many rare species of wildlife. charles darwin researched here 160 years ago when developing his theory of evolution. even today, the animals are isolated from human interference as tourism here is restricted. american pollution experts have been drafted in to help. one concern is the oil will sink to the ocean floor and destroy algae. the bottom line is that once oil gets out of a ship, it is -- there is -- it is virtually impossible to remove it or contain it on the open ocean. there are still 6,000 gallons of diesel aboard the "jessica." crews are trying to remove the remaining tanks. a government spokesman has blamed this disaster on the ship's captain saying she ran aground because he was navigating in shallow waters without a map. anna bell roberts, itn.

Abortion rights supporters are used to battle. But the ground has changed for the 28th anniversary of the landmark Roe v. Wade decision that legalized abortion. Abortion foes were energized by the changed political landscape and planned to be out in force Monday, marking the Supreme Court ruling with marches and protests. Bill Clinton, who helped the cause for keeping abortions legal, is gone from the White House, replaced by anti-abortion President Bush, who has nominated an even more staunch abortion opponent, John Ashcroft, as attorney general. White House Chief of Staff Andrew Card served notice Sunday that several key abortion policies would be quickly reviewed by the Bush administration. Asked about the recently approved RU-486 abortion pill, Card said, ``We're going to take a look at all of the regulations. We're going to take a look at all the executive orders.'' Another regulation approved by Clinton restored federal funding for some groups that offer abortion counseling overseas. ``That's an important matter,'' press secretary Ari Fleischer said. ``The president does not support using federal funds to promote abortion. ``Certainly we can't count on the White House now,'' said Patricia Ireland, president of the National Organization for Women. ``And we may not be able to count on the court even now _ but for sure if one more nominee gets through that's anything like the Ashcroft model.'' As a Republican senator from Missouri, Ashcroft proposed a constitutional amendment that would outlaw nearly all abortions, including in cases of rape and incest. He also opposes most forms of contraception. Republicans also control Congress now, and Bush could appoint one or more Supreme Court justices. Just one appointment could tip the balance _ with many decisions now being made on 5-4 votes. Any nominee, however, would have to be approved by a Senate divided 50-50 along party lines. ``It's like a shot across the bow _ a warning of things to come that could impact long past Bush's term, even if he's a two-term president,'' Ireland said. First lady Laura Bush broke from her husband's views last week and said she did not think the 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling should be overturned. But that gives little comfort to abortion rights supporters. Regardless of what his wife thinks, ``Bush has signaled that he is going to act on his personal convictions that a woman should not have the right to choose,'' said Gloria Feldt, president of Planned Parenthood Federation of America. Abortion opponents are more upbeat than they have been in years. They include Norma McCorvey, the ``Jane Roe'' of Roe v. Wade who now runs Dallas-based Roe No More Ministry, a speakers' referral service for the anti-abortion cause. ``I think the majority of pro-lifers are really looking forward to President Bush getting into office,'' McCorvey said. ``I think we all have the same dream: We'd like to see Roe v. Wade overturned.'' Abortion opponents think it's just a matter of time before abortion is outlawed again. ``I think pro-life people _ and I think that's a majority in the country _ certainly feel better now,'' said David O'Steen, executive director of National Right to Life. McCorvey, meanwhile, dismissed Ashcroft's statement at his Senate confirmation hearing that he would not try to make abortion illegal. ``I would like to think that John didn't really mean that,'' she said. But neither side is taking anything for granted. Monday's marches and other events by abortion opponents were being countered with efforts by abortion rights groups to mobilize their forces against Ashcroft with radio ads and Internet campaigns. Americans in general remain split on abortion. An exit poll in the presidential election found more voters favored keeping abortion legal, 55 percent to 42 percent. But only 20 percent thought it should be legal in all cases and 35 percent said it should be legal in most cases. Outlawing abortion after nearly three decades won't be easy. The fight isn't solely about Roe v. Wade anymore, said Laura Woliver, a political scientist and associate director of women's studies at the University of South Carolina. Abortion access can be eroded in other ways _ through regulation or by giving states more power, she noted. As attorney general, Ashcroft would decide how to enforce such laws as the Freedom of Access to Clinics Entrances law that seeks to ensure that patients and employees can come and go safely, Woliver said. Anti-abortion groups want Bush to repeal some Clinton executive orders. One eliminated the rule barring clinics from discussing abortion if they receive federal funds. Another ended the policy preventing foreign aid from funding abortions or educating people about them. Bush supports tightening standards for doctors administering the newly approved abortion pill RU-486, and has said he would sign legislation banning the late-term abortion procedure critics call ``partial-birth abortion'' that Clinton has vetoed. Bush also opposes federally funded research using stem cells from discarded human embryos.

Rescuers were frantically searching Monday for a construction worker trapped nine days under an earthquake-triggered mudslide after a dog smelled life under the mountain of dirt. Luis Alberto Alas, 39, was building a balcony on a luxury home in the Santa Tecla neighborhood of Las Colinas on Jan. 13 when a 7.6-magnitude earthquake buried the area under a mountain of dirt, killing more than 700 people. Alas' wife, Mercedes, had stood vigil over the spot where she believed her husband might be trapped since the quake, but searchers going over the area had found no trace of him. The search began anew late Sunday when Jimmy, a German Shepherd donated by the French government, indicated he smelled something under the ground where Mercedes Alas had told rescue crews to dig. ``We heard noises and it sounded like those noises could belong to a person,'' said Ivon Delsaut, a French volunteer involved in the new search. ``It felt as if somebody was punching the ground below us,'' added Salvadoran Red Cross rescuer Jesus Balcaceres. Crews dug all night Sunday _ but remained unsure if anyone was alive under the rubble. ``I will never lose hope that he is under there alive,'' Mercedes Alas said. ``This was a construction site where there were many large objects that could protect my husband from the dirt.'' The last person pulled alive from the debris was Sergio Moreno. The 22-year-old keyboard player was freed a day after the earthquake after spending 31 hours trapped in the bathroom of his Las Colinas home. He died two days later. As rescuers again dug into what was left of Las Colinas, those living in a nearby refugee camp wondered how they would put the pieces of their lives back together. ``We will stay here until they tell us it's time to go, then we will move to another camp,'' said Jose Luis Solorzano, 40, who worked as a cab driver until the quake leveled his three-room shack and flattened his taxi. ``It is very crowded here and it gets cold at night. But living on the street there are no donated clothes or tents and life is even more miserable.'' The quake's death toll stands at 710. The quake destroyed 141,000 Salvadoran homes and left approximately 750,000 people homeless. Three small aftershocks were recorded in El Salvador on Sunday, bringing the total number since last Saturday's quake to 1,927. No injuries or damage were reported in Sunday's aftershocks.

tom, even as the president vows to move quickly on his agenda of education reform and tax cuts, on his first day of official business, bush decides to send his strongest message on the issue of abortion. 28 years to the day since the roe v. wade decision legalized abortion, bush today issues an xktive order banning federal funding for international groups that offer abortions or counseling abroad. a ban president clinton had lifted. he thinks that this will help make abortion more rare. he thinks that is not the wisest use of taxpayer money, in any case, to be used for abortion, to promote abortion. the decision, which aides say is simply the fulfillment of a campaign pledge, came as thousands of abortion foes marched in washington. in a statement read to the demonstrators, bush wrote -- "we share a great goal -- to work toward a day when every child is welcomed in life and protected in law." bush's abortion decision just one move on an active first day at the white house. this morning, bush looks on as vice president cheney swears in members of the new white house staff, an emotional moment for some who have worked with bush for years. and in trying to draw a sharp distinction between his administration and president clinton's, bush demands his team to "remember the high standards that come with high office." i expect every member of this administration to stay well within the boundaries that define legal and ethical conduct. let us begin the work we were hired to do and leave this a better place than we found it. for bush, the work begins quickly. aides announcing the president's first foreign trip, a meeting in mexico next month with president visent fox. bush meets with literacy experts one day before he'll send his education reform package to congress. and holds separate sessions with republican leaders and democratic elders to discuss not just education but the massive tax cut proposal. this administration will seek the good in everybody and find that ability to come together for the good of the country as well. despite such calls for bipartisanship, sources say bush assured republican leaders that he won't back down from a fight with democrats over his agenda and he'll focus on immediate results. according to someone in the room bush told them "i'm not going to worry about my legacy." tom? thanks very much, david gregory tonight.

Getting swiftly down to work, President Bush ushered in his new administration Monday by welcoming his staff to ``the honor of a lifetime'' and calling on them to uphold high ethical standards. As scores of new White House staff members were sworn in, Bush asked them to help deliver on promises he made during the campaign, saying, ``We are here to make progress, we are not here just to mark time.'' ``I want it said of us that promises made were promises kept,'' Bush said in his first official appearance in the East Room. With that, Bush sent his aides back to their empty offices, where they found fresh coats of paint and new carpeting but little else. Computers were still to be hooked up, paper supplies restocked and telephone directories circulated. Press secretary Ari Fleischer announced Bush's first trip overseas, to Mexico on Feb. 16. Bush also said he has decided to block U.S. funds to international family-planning groups that are involved in abortion. Bush, said he will issue an executive order ``soon'' reversing the Clinton administration position. He made the decision as abortion foes gathered to march in Washington to mark the 28th anniversary of the landmark Roe v. Wade decision that legalized abortion. Bush also met with GOP congressional leaders and, separately, was meeting Democratic elder statesmen such as Jody Powell, press secretary for President Carter, and former Ohio Sen. John Glenn and former Democratic Party chairman Robert Strauss. ``In order to get an agenda through the Congress, its best that I be able to personally explain the issues and what I'm attempting to do,'' Bush said after the gathering with GOP lawmakers. ``Get used to it,'' Fleischer said, announcing that Bush would be with Democratic congressional leaders Tuesday. ``He's going to continue to identify those Democrats who are most willing to work with him.'' Bush, who entered the Oval Office shortly before 7:30 a.m. for his first working day, also planned to meet with Secretary of State Colin Powell. The pair will visit weekly, Fleischer said. With wife Laura, Vice President Dick Cheney and White House chief of staff Andrew Card at his side, the new president implicitly sought to draw a distinction between his administration and President Clinton's, which was tainted by scandal. ``I expect every member of this administration to stay well within the boundaries that define legal and ethical conduct,'' Bush said. ``This means avoiding even the appearance of improper conduct.'' He urged the staff members to consult White House counsel Al Gonzales on ethical matters. And he called on them to confront colleagues if they see questionable behavior. ``No one should hesitate to confront me as well,'' Bush said. Bush also expressed relief at a deal Clinton struck on Friday, his last full day in office, sparing himself possible indictment in the Monica Lewinsky case by acknowledging for the first time that he had made false statements under oath about his relationship with the former White House intern. ``My feeling about the action of last Friday was, it's finally over with,'' he told reporters. ``It's now time to move on.'' Cheney, who worked in the Nixon and first Bush White Houses, recalled taking the same oath some 32 years ago when he was a first-time White House staffer. And, before administering the oath to several dozen aides with their right hands upraised, Cheney sounded a fatherly but stern warning. ``You've all taken up some serious responsibilities. ... You serve the president and you serve the White House and the government. But most of all, you serve the American people. ``In the final analysis, it's important to remember only one man put his name on the ballot,'' Cheney said, with a nod to Bush. ``He'll be held accountable for your performance.'' In meetings this week with lawmakers from both parties, Bush was to discuss plans to submit to Congress the outline of his plan to change federal education laws. The proposal includes private-school choice and school vouchers, although administration officials signaled they won't be a top priority. Bush made no mention of that proposal in public remarks after a meeting with education leaders Monday afternoon. Bush, his wife and his chosen education secretary, Rod Paige, met with 14 schools leaders behind closed doors for 45 minutes. ``Reading is the new civil right, the cornerstone of hope and opportunity in America,'' Bush told reporters. The new Republican president's $1.6 trillion, 10-year tax-cut plan was introduced by Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, and Sen. Zell Miller, D-Ga. But other Democrats said the proposal snubs fiscal discipline and does not do enough to pay down the national debt, and they warned that Bush faces difficult days in Congress if he ignores their priorities. Even though Bush plans to meet this week with Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., the principal GOP advocate of a comprehensive overhaul of campaign finance laws, White House officials made clear that education, tax reform and military spending come first. Although school vouchers remain in the Bush education package as a means of enabling parents to move their children from failing public schools to higher achieving private institutions, Card said they ``won't be a top priority of this administration.'' Vouchers are strongly opposed by many Democrats, in large part because of their perceived threat to the viability of the public education system.

Along with thousands of other Congolese, Deborah Ngondu waited in line for hours to pay her respects to assassinated President Laurent Kabila, lying in state ahead of a Tuesday funeral. ``I won't go home without seeing the president. I must say goodbye,'' the 17-year-old student said Monday at the open-air Palace of the People. ``I'm very sad. The Americans killed the president.'' Such anti-Western sentiment has skyrocketed in this Central African capital since Kabila was gunned down in his presidential palace last week. Details of the assassination remain murky. The government _ now led by Kabila's son, Joseph _ says a lone bodyguard shot the president; but some reports suggest a bitter argument with military brass prompted the slaying. A host of African countries are supporting the government or various rebel factions in a civil war that erupted in 1998, but frustrated Congolese are increasingly pointing fingers further afield to explain their deeply divided nation's problems. ``The white man is very bad. They don't want blacks to progress,'' said Vital Nutedika, 35. ``Kabila has died because he said no to the white man.'' The West has a brutal past in Congo. The nation, originally formed in the late 19th century as the personal property of Belgium's King Leopold II, was built by slaves, some of whom had their hands chopped off when they did not fulfill rubber harvest quotas. In the decades after independence in 1960, the West kept friendly relations with heavy-handed ruler Mobutu Sese Seko, one of many anti-communist dictators tolerated by the United States and its Cold War allies. The West initially welcomed former rebel Kabila as he took power in 1997, hoping he would bring peace and democracy to Congo. But Europe and the United States grew disenchanted as Kabila stalled a United Nations-led peace effort and continued the same dictatorial practices as his predecessor. European Union foreign ministers said Monday they were considering imposing an arms embargo on Congo. After a meeting in Brussels, the ministers stressed in a statement that ``lasting peace in (Congo) can be achieved only through a negotiated peace settlement.'' Just two days ago, many Kinshasa residents said they despised Kabila's increasingly corrupt rule. Now, a day after the return of Kabila's body to Kinshasa, people are praising him as a fatherly figure who opened their eyes to injustices perpetrated by Westerners. Emanuel Okita, a 40-year-old unemployed economist, insisted the faltering economy has nothing to do with the country's leaders, who for decades have plundered Congo's vast mineral wealth. It is the Europeans, he said, who pilfer profits from exports like diamonds, gold and oil while inflating import prices. ``It is the white man's fault. They only gave us political independence. We still depend on them economically,'' said Okita, a father of four struggling to keep his children in school. Others claim that Westerners are provoking the civil war. The conflict has pitted Kabila's government _ propped up by troops from Angola, Namibia and Zimbabwe _ against rebels supported by Rwanda and Uganda, ``They interfere in Congolese business in an attempt to re-colonize the country,'' said a jobless teacher who identified herself only as Nutedika. Okita and Nutedika both welcomed Joseph Kabila as their new leader. They hope he will restart a peace process that stalled under his father's rule _ despite reported clashes last week between government forces and Rwandan troops; and the government asking Rwanda, Uganda and Burundi on Monday not to send delegations to Kabila's funeral. That's what Paul Negengele wants too, but he thinks it's too early to discuss such political issues. ``Speaking as Africans, as President Kabila has died, we have to participate in the funeral,'' he said while selling mangos at a roadside table for 20 cents each. ``After that, we can talk about who should take power.''

I am David Coler, VOA News. Reversing a 1993 decision by former President Bill Clinton, President George W Bush ordered a ban Monday on using US funds for family planning groups that offer abortion or abortion counseling overseas. Mr. Bush said US taxpayer dollars should not go to such groups. Former Presidents Reagan and Bush imposed the same restrictions in the 1980s but President Clinton overturned them. Abortion foes hailed the new President's order but pro-choice advocates say this is the first step toward making abortion illegal in the United States. Bush spokesman Arie Fleischer was asked if the President would also re-impose a ban on fetal cell tissue used in scientific research. President is very well aware of the importance of that issue for it presents a fine balance between medical research and helping find cures and solutions to problems and protecting the life of the unborn. And he does support research from adult stem cells but he does not support fetal tissue research from induced abortions and I think that's an important decision to make. Presidential spokesman, Arie Fleischer.

Ecuadorian President Gustavo Nobola has declared a state of emergency on the Galapico's islands where an oil spill is threatening thousands of rare and endangered species. An oil tanker ran aground near the island's main port last week and began leaking diesel and heavy boat fuel. Workers are struggling to clean up the spill and pump the remaining oil out of the stricken boat. Workers fear the vessel could break up. Ecuador's Environment Minister says the oil has affected a number of birds and several sea lions and is threatening to create an ecological calamity. The islands are home to thousands of rare plants and animals including world famous giant tortoises.

Four of seven escaped Texas prison inmates are in police custody and a fifth committed suicide Monday after police in Colorado discovered them living in a trailer park. The remaining two escapees are still at large, says FBI agent Mark Mershon. It is very important for the public to listen. We have two subjects who are still on the loose. They are armed and extremely dangerous. They're in fact heavily armed. We know this based upon an interview of the subjects we have in custody. Acting on tips from local residents, police surrounded three of the fugitives as they were driving from a shopping center. A fourth later gave himself up. The fifth man fatally shot himself in the chest after barricading himself inside a mobile home for several hours. No one else was injured. The seven escaped from a Texas State prison December 13th. They are suspected of robbing a sporting goods store near Dallas on Christmas Eve and killing a police officer.

The pardon of Marc Rich, the commodities trader who has been a fugitive for almost two decades, came as a surprise to federal prosecutors when President Clinton granted it as one of his final acts on Saturday. Lawyers for Rich headed off opposition to the pardon by waiting until December to ask for one and by appealing directly to Clinton. The last-minute pardon of Rich and his former partner, Pincus Green, was not warmly received by officials who had been involved in prosecuting Rich, who fled to Switzerland in 1983 after he was charged with 51 counts of conspiracy, tax evasion, racketeering and trading with the enemy. Mary Jo White, the U.S. Attorney in Manhattan, said Monday: ``We were totally unaware that pardons for Marc Rich and Pincus Green were under consideration. The Department of Justice was also bypassed in a number of pardon applications for defendants from this district.'' The Justice Department is usually given the chance to review applications for pardons, a department spokeswoman said, but the president has absolute authority to grant them. Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, a former federal prosecutor, has been outspoken in his criticism of the pardon of Rich, who was accused of evading $48 million in taxes and violating U.S. sanctions by trading oil with Iran. Monday, Giuliani called on Congress to review the decision, questioning the connection to the ``enormous amounts of money'' Rich's family members raised for the president. Rich's former wife, Denise Rich, has been an active fund-raiser for Clinton and the Democratic Party. She could not be reached for comment Monday, but a spokesman, Bobby Zarem, said that she, too, had been surprised by the pardon. ``She was so taken aback by this, more or as much as anyone else,'' Zarem said. Bob Fink, a lawyer in Manhattan who helped prepare Rich's pardon application, said that despite being divorced, Ms. Rich had long held that the charges against her former husband were not justified. Fink and Jack Quinn, a former White House counsel in the Clinton administration, made that argument in the application they filed with the White House in December. They argued that there was no basis for criminal charges against Rich and that the case should have been resolved with regulators and did not merit the involvement of the Justice Department, Fink said. ``I think we made a good case that this was a case that shouldn't have been brought in the first place,'' Fink said. He said the prosecution of Rich resulted from ``some overzealousness'' on the part of the prosecutors and that all similar cases, including those that involved people who participated in trades with Rich, were treated as civil matters and handled by securities regulators. ``The situation was we were really the only ones where this was criminalized,'' Fink said. Fink said that ``lots of people'' had written letters in support of a pardon for Rich but he declined to name them. He said that Quinn, having worked in the White House, was barred from lobbying the White House but that temporary prohibition did not apply to representing clients in criminal or civil proceedings.

Acting on a tip, authorities on Monday captured four of the seven convicts who broke out of a Texas prison nearly six weeks ago and allegedly gunned down a policeman on Christmas Eve. A fifth inmate killed himself inside a motor home that had been surrounded by authorities in this foothills community about 50 miles southwest of Denver. The whereabouts of the two other inmates were unknown. Authorities said they may have been in Woodland Park as recently as Sunday and may have left to get more money. ``The story is by no means over,'' said Mark Mershon, the top FBI official in Colorado. ``We have two suspects that are still on the loose.'' Authorities said surveillance of the trailer park began at 2 a.m. Monday, and they didn't believe the two inmates on the run slipped past officers. They aren't sure when the men left. The heavily armed inmates _ including murderers, rapists and armed robbers _ had puzzled and alarmed authorities by remaining together after bluffing their way out of prison Dec. 13. The slaying of the Dallas-area officer 11 days later only increased fears that the inmates might want to go out in a blaze of gunfire. Among those arrested was George Rivas, 30, the suspected ringleader who was serving a life sentence for robbery and kidnapping. Investigators have portrayed Rivas as fearless and shrewd with a powerful hold over the others, but authorities said he expressed remorse as he admitted to the slaying of the policeman. ``He stated that he had a change of heart, change of life and he wanted this to end,'' said State Patrol Trooper Eric Zachareas, who was at the convenience store where Rivas and two others were arrested. Rivas had dyed his hair blonde and another inmate had dyed his hair orange in an apparent attempt to avoid scrutiny, Zachareas said. He also said some of the fugitives may have been at a Colorado Springs bar late Saturday. ``Apparently, they were out partying,'' he said. The convicts arrived in the area on Jan. 1, Teller County Sheriff Frank Fehn said. He offered no other details of their activities, nor how they covered the more than 800 miles from the prison in south Texas. Authorities said a weekend tip prompted by the show ``America's Most Wanted'' led to the capture. The show had featured the convicts four times since the escape, including the last three Saturday nights. Undersheriff Kevin Dougherty said authorities were told about the fugitives by the manager of the Coachlight, a combination motel and RV park where the motor home was located. The park, tucked away amid pine trees, was put under surveillance at 2 a.m. Monday, authorities said. Rivas and two others were arrested not at the RV park but as they pulled up for gasoline at a convenience store near Woodland Park. The Texas Department of Criminal Justice said Rivas was captured with inmates Michael Rodriguez and Joseph Garcia. Authorities said inmate Larry Harper killed himself inside the motor home sometime after another convict, Randy Halprin, walked outside. Harper had wanted to speak to his father and authorities arranged for him to do so by cellphone, Fehn said. He was dead from a gunshot wound to the chest by the time the arrangements were made. Authorities said Monday night that Halprin had an old wound that he may have sustained during the robbery in Irving. Authorities found 15 handguns inside the motor home and another gun in the Jeep, Zachareas said. Still missing were Patrick Murphy Jr., convicted of rape, and Donald Newbury, imprisoned for armed robbery. Authorities said two fugitives may be seeking more money. Zachareas said he didn't know whether that meant they planned a robbery, and Fehn said authorities had ``no idea'' where the pair might be. ``It's very scary,'' said Kristie Allen, 27, a hairstylist at Hair Studio West in Woodland Park, who listened to news of the captures on a shop radio. ``No one wants to go outside.'' The seven inmates followed a cunning plan to overpower 13 prison employees during their escape from the maximum-security Connally Unit in Kenedy, southeast of San Antonio. They stole a cache of weapons and drove away unchallenged in a prison pickup. According to authorities, the inmates robbed an Irving sporting goods store and gunned down Officer Aubrey Hawkins when he showed up. He was shot 11 times and his body was run over by a vehicle. The thieves fled with guns, clothing and $70,000 in cash and checks. A $500,000 reward was offered for information leading to the arrest and conviction of Hawkins' killer. After the convicts were captured, his mother, Jayne Hawkins, said: ``I want them to see me ... They will look at me and I want to see what they look like when they look at the mother of a child who is gone.'' The escape was the largest from a Texas state prison in modern history. Before last month, Texas had recaptured all but one of the 143 inmates who escaped from its state prisons in the past 10 years. A scathing state review blamed prison employees for the escape; a warden has since been demoted and other employees disciplined. The parents of Halprin, the youngest escaped convict at 23, were grateful when they learned of his capture, said Bill Waybourn, a family friend and chief of police in the Fort Worth suburb where Halprin grew up. ``They're obviously so relieved that no other police officers or innocent people were hurt, and extremely relieved that this thing looks like it's going to wind down fairly peaceful _ answered prayers, to be exact,'' he said. ___ On the Net: Texas Department of Criminal Justice: www.tdcj.state.tx.us Irving Police Department: www.irvingpd.com

The potholed streets have been swept clean, the curbs have been painted and palm fronds _ a sign of mourning _ have been placed along lampposts and streetlights as this crumbling capital city prepares for the burial of its late president, Laurent Kabila. Kabila, who has been lying in state for the past two days, was to be interred Tuesday, one week after he was shot repeatedly by a bodyguard who was then himself killed, according to government officials. It also comes amid skyrocketing anti-Western sentiment as the people of this city lash out at foreigners, particular white foreigners, blaming them for Kabila's killing. ``The white man is very bad. They don't want blacks to progress,'' said Vital Nutedika, 35, one of thousands of Congolese who stood outside in the glaring sun Monday to pass by Kabila's white casket. ``Kabila has died because he said no to the white man.'' Why Kabila was killed remains a mystery, though theories are rampant, ranging from a single angry gunman, to a power-grab within Kabila's inner circle to a link to Congo's more than two-year-old civil war, which has left the country splintered into government-held regions and areas controlled by rebel armies. The government _ now led by Kabila's son Joseph _ holds to the lone bodyguard version. Much of the public bitterness, though, appears more rooted in desperate poverty and frustration than in racism, or a belief that Western countries are behind the assassination. Poverty and unemployment are more norm than exception in Kinshasa, and the economy has been left in tatters by the war. Many people struggle by on salaries that may total less than $10 a month _ and many of them regularly go months without getting a paycheck at all. In the first days after Kabila was killed, and his son quickly named to his place, angry words against the ruling family were commonly heard in Kinshasa. That changed when Kabila's casket was put on display Sunday. But, perhaps in part because local tradition calls for at least a few days of mourning for anyone killed, Kabila is now being warmly remembered in Kinshasa The West does, however, have a brutal past in Congo. The nation, originally the personal property of Belgium's King Leopold II, saw slavery continue into the 20th century. In the decades after independence in 1960, the West kept friendly relations with Mobutu Sese Seko, the deeply corrupt dictator who was backed for his anti-communist stance. The West initially welcomed former rebel Kabila as he took power in 1997, hoping he would bring democracy to Congo. But Europe and the United States grew disenchanted as Kabila stalled a United Nations-led investigation and continued the same dictatorial practices as his predecessor. European Union foreign ministers said Monday they were considering imposing an arms embargo on Congo. After a meeting in Brussels, the ministers stressed in a statement that ``lasting peace in (Congo) can be achieved only through a negotiated peace settlement.'' Congo's civil war, which began in 1998, pits Kabila's government _ propped up by troops from Angola, Namibia and Zimbabwe _ against rebels supported by Rwanda and Uganda.

Jennifer Capriati's latest win made her feel like a kid again. With a 5-7, 6-4, 6-3 victory Tuesday over Monica Seles at the Australian Open, Capriati became a Grand Slam semifinalist for only the second time since 1991, when she was 15. ``It's one of the best matches I've played,'' said Capriati, now 24. ``It kind of reminded me of the old days.'' Defending champion Andre Agassi became the first men's semifinalist by beating Todd Martin 7-5, 6-3, 6-4. Agassi committed just 14 unforced errors to 36 for Martin, who upset No. 3 Pete Sampras in the fourth round. Agassi, seeded sixth, will next play the winner of the match Tuesday night between No. 12 Pat Rafter and No. 14 Dominik Hrbaty. Capriati lost a dramatic first set and fell behind in the second, then rallied as Seles tired. Seles, seeded fourth, fell to 37-2 at the Australian Open. She won the title in 1991-93 and 1996, and her only other loss was to Martina Hingis in the 1999 semifinals. Capriati reached the Australian Open semifinals last year before losing to eventual champion Lindsay Davenport. Her next opponent will be the winner of the match Tuesday night between the No. 2 Davenport and No. 8 Anna Kournikova. ``I think I'll be watching that match,'' said Capriati, who is seeded 12th. The quarterfinals will be completed Wednesday. The top-seeded Hingis will play No. 6 Serena Williams, and No. 3 Venus Williams will take on No. 10 Amanda Coetzer. Missing from the final eight were the four top-seeded men _ only the third time that's happened in a Grand Slam tournament since the Open era began in 1968. No. 4 Magnus Norman was eliminated in the last fourth-round match by No. 16 Sebastien Grosjean 7-6 (7), 6-3, 0-6, 6-4. No. 1 Gustavo Kuerten and No. 2 Marat Safin also lost earlier. In Wednesday's matches, Grosjean plays unseeded Carlos Moya, and No. 5 Yevgeny Kafelnikov faces No. 15 Arnaud Clement. Capriati, who has endured many wrenching postmatch news conferences at Grand Slam tournaments, this time was beaming. Even the potentially touchy subject of her recent weight loss couldn't stop her from smiling, and she confirmed that her conditioning is much improved. ``It's a lot of hard work that has paid off,'' she said. ``I'm just thrilled.'' Capriati left the women's tour for several years in the mid-1990s because of drug and personal problems. Her father, Stefano, began coaching her again last year, and she said her improved results are a reflection of her contentment off the court. ``The tennis sort of follows that,'' she said. ``I'm just happy playing tennis and feel free and relaxed with it.'' Capriati had lost all five previous Grand Slam meetings against Seles. The rivalry dates to the 1990 French Open, when Capriati was 14. ``Now I'm older and a lot stronger and physically fit, so maybe I can get back those hard balls she hits better now,'' Capriati said. She kept Seles on the move with deep groundstrokes to both corners, and in the second set the tactic began to take a toll. Seles tired despite the mild weather, and after she took a 4-2 lead in the second set, Capriati won eight consecutive games. Seles finally closed out the first set after Capriati had saved seven set points, all in the tense final game. It lasted 22 points, went to deuce eight times and included two rallies of more than 20 shots. Seles appeared on the verge of victory in the second set when Capriati double-faulted to fall behind 4-2, threw her racket in anger and drew a warning from the chair umpire. ``I just wanted to cut down on my errors and execute my shots better, and that's what I did,'' Capriati said. She broke right back, evened the set at 4-4 with her third ace and then began to dominate the baseline rallies. When she closed out the 1-hour, 55-minute win, she grinned, blew kisses to the center-court crowd and said ``I love you'' to a TV camera _ a message for her mother and brother back home in Florida.

Patrick Rafter played commanding tennis before his home fans Tuesday, winning 12 of the last 13 games to beat Dominik Hrbaty in four sets and reach the Australian Open semifinals. The Aussie rebounded from a 4-1 deficit in the third set, then swept the next one to win 6-2, 6-7 (4), 7-5, 6-0 and set up a showdown with defending champion Andre Agassi. ``This is what it feels like, huh?'' said Rafter, who has won two U.S. Opens and was runner-up last year at Wimbledon but never had done better at the Australian than the fourth round in 1995. ``It's been a long time. It feels very satisfying being at home doing it.'' Agassi used his full arsenal to beat Todd Martin 7-5, 6-3, 6-4. Martin already had knocked out Pete Sampras, preventing a rematch of last year's semifinal in which Agassi rallied past Sampras in five sets. Rafter is the first Australian to go this far in his home country's Grand Slam tournament since Mark Woodforde reached the semifinals in 1996. He displayed crafty serving and acrobatic volleying. He also was helped by Hrbaty. The No. 14 seeded player double-faulted twice when he was broken in the third set's seventh game and once more when he was broken again in the 11th. On the women's side, No. 12 Jennifer Capriati rallied from a 4-2 deficit in the second set and reached the Australian semifinals for the second straight year with a 5-7, 6-4, 6-3 victory over four-time Australian Open champion Monica Seles. In a rematch of one of last year's semifinals, she faces defending champion Lindsay Davenport, who beat No. 8 Anna Kournikova 6-4, 6-2. Kournikova, in a Grand Slam quarterfinal for the first time since reaching the semifinals at Wimbledon in 1997, had some chances but made too many errors. Davenport said Kournikova hits very hard and flat, and ``doesn't have a huge margin for error. Sometimes you get a lot of free points.'' Davenport, seeded second, was called for foot faults several times. ``I'll have to work on that,'' she said. ``It didn't hurt me tonight.'' Rafter was caught off guard in the second set when Hrbaty, who earlier beat U.S. Open champion Marat Safin, suddenly switched to a serve-and-volley attack. ``I got a little bit frustrated,'' Rafter said. ``He got his momentum going. I knew if I could hang in there and break him my serve would hold up.'' Agassi's best moment came on match point. Martin hit a good angled volley. Agassi chased it down, blasted a shot that Martin could only block back, and then lobbed over him. Agassi interrupted his match briefly to catch a bug near the baseline and throw it off court. Martin, trailing 30-40 and 1-2 in the final set, waited out the distraction and then served an ace. He then held serve and, three games later, broke Agassi for a 4-3 lead. But Agassi broke right back and went on to win. ``I put on a good front,'' Agassi said of his mercy toward the bug. Agassi's Australian Open triumph last year ended a run of four Grand Slam tournaments in which he also won the French and U.S. Opens and was runner-up at Wimbledon. ``There's no saying it can't be done,'' he said of winning all four in a year. ``But I think we're a lot closer to seeing Mark McGwire's home run record being beat than we are to seeing someone win four Grand Slams in the same year in the men's game.'' Martin said the Sampras he beat _ ending a 13-match losing streak against him _ was out of practice, but ``Andre is very much in form. ... Andre thrives on confidence, and he's got plenty of it.'' ``I was beaten today,'' Martin said. ``I certainly didn't lose. I didn't play nearly as well as I had hoped. Most of that is due to the way Andre played.'' Agassi improved his record against Martin to 13-5. Nobody ever has beaten both Sampras and Agassi at a Grand Slam tournament. Capriati's victory made her a Grand Slam tournament semifinalist for only the second time since 1991, when she was 15. ``It's one of the best matches I've played,'' said the 24-year-old Capriati. ``It kind of reminded me of the old days.'' She lost the first set after saving seven points in a final game with 22 points and eight deuces, and fell behind in the second. After a double fault gave Seles a 4-2 lead, Capriati hurled her racket to the court, drawing a warning from the umpire. Then she won eight games in a row. ``I just changed making so many errors and kept the ball in the court more. She started missing. Before I knew it, I won that second set,'' Capriati said. It was Seles' second loss in 39 matches at Australian Opens. She won the title in 1991-93 and 1996, and her only other loss was to Martina Hingis in the 1999 semifinals. In remaining quarterfinals Wednesday, top-seeded Hingis plays No. 6 Serena Williams, and No. 3 Venus Williams meets No. 10 Amanda Coetzer. On the men's side, 1999 champion and 2000 runner-up Yevgeny Kafelnikov plays No. 15 Arnaud Clement, and No. 16 Sebastien Grosjean meets Carlos Moya, who is unseeded but a former No. 1. After Grosjean beat No. 4 Magnus Norman on Monday night, all four top men's seeds were gone before the quarterfinals for only the third time in a Grand Slam tournament since the Open era began in 1968. No. 1 Gustavo Kuerten, No. 2 Safin and No. 3 Sampras lost earlier.

Andre Agassi loves to make opponents work. Patrick Rafter makes hard work pay off in his acrobatic attacking. The two are headed for a semifinal meeting at the Australian Open after Agassi beat Todd Martin 7-5, 6-3, 6-4 and Rafter rebounded from 1-4 in the third set to beat Dominik Hrbaty 6-2, 6-7 (4), 7-5, 6-0 Tuesday. Agassi is the defending champion and this time doesn't have Pete Sampras to worry about. Martin knocked Sampras out in fourth round, after losing to him 13 times in a row. Last year, Agassi's come-from-behind, five-set victory over Sampras was the supreme showdown of the Australian Open. Agassi also has a 7-4 record against Rafter. But Rafter won their last meeting in the Wimbledon semifinals last year, has won two U.S. Opens and is a heavy local favorite, the first Australian since Mark Woodforde in 1996 to reach the semifinals of the home country's Grand Slam tournament. ``This is what it feels like, huh?'' said Rafter, who never had done better at the Australian than the fourth round in 1995. ``It's been a long time. It feels very satisfying being at home doing it.'' The crowd helps, he said. ``You don't get this quite anywhere else, for me at least,'' he added. In winning 12 of the last 13 games, he also was helped by Hrbaty's collapse. The No. 14 seed double-faulted twice as he was broken in the third set's seventh game and again when he was broken in the 11th. He put in only 24 percent of his first serves in the final set. On the women's side, 12th-seeded Jennifer Capriati rallied from 2-4 in the second set and reached the semifinals here for the second straight year with a 5-7, 6-4, 6-3 victory over four-time champion Monica Seles. In a rematch of one of last year's semifinals, she faces defending champion Lindsay Davenport, who beat No. 8 Anna Kournikova 6-4, 6-2. Kournikova, in a Grand Slam quarterfinal for the first time since reaching the semifinals at Wimbledon in 1997, had some chances but made too many errors. Davenport, seeded second, said Kournikova hits very hard and flat, and ``doesn't have a huge margin for error. Sometimes you get a lot of free points.'' Rafter was caught off guard in the second set when Hrbaty, conqueror of U.S. Open champion and second-seed Marat Safin, suddenly switched to a serve-and-volley attack. ``I got a little bit frustrated. He got his momentum going. I knew if I could hang in there and break him my serve would hold up,'' Rafter said. Rafter showed his athletic style on a number of points, lunging to defend and then recovering to attack. Agassi's best demonstration came on match point. Martin hit a good angle volley. Agassi chased it down, blasted a shot that Martin could only block back, then lobbed over him. Agassi interrupted his match briefly to catch a bug near the baseline and throw it off court. Martin, trailing 30-40 and 1-2 in the final set, waited out the distraction and served an ace. He then held serve and, three games later, broke Agassi for a 4-3 lead. But Agassi broke right back and went on to win. ``I put on a good front,'' Agassi said of his mercy toward the bug. His tennis, meanwhile, ``feels pretty good. I've gotten better as the tournament has gone on,'' the No. 6 seed said. Agassi's Australian Open triumph last year ended a run of four Grand Slam tournaments where he also won the French and U.S. Opens and was runner-up at Wimbledon. Winning all four in a year ``would be great,'' he said. ``There's no saying it can't be done, but I think we're a lot closer to seeing Mark McGwire's home run record being beat than we are to seeing someone win four Grand Slams in the same year in the men's game.'' Martin said the Sampras that he beat was out of practice, but ``Andre is very much in form. ... Andre thrives on confidence, and he's got plenty of it.'' ``I was beaten today,'' Martin said. ``I certainly didn't lose. I didn't play nearly as well as I had hoped. Most of that is due to the way Andre played.'' Agassi improved his record against Martin to 13-5. Nobody ever has beaten both Sampras and Agassi at a Grand Slam tournament. Looking ahead to Rafter's serve-and-volley style, Agassi said, ``You know he's going to do it, and he still is athlete enough to pull it off, which is incredible.'' Rafter said that to beat Agassi, ``I'm going to have to serve better _ it's that simple _ and probably be a little more inventive from the baseline.'' Capriati's victory made her a Grand Slam semifinalist for only the second time since 1991, when she was 15. ``It's one of the best matches I've played,'' said Capriati, now 24. ``It kind of reminded me of the old days.'' She lost the first set after saving seven points in a final game with 22 points and eight deuces, and fell behind in the second. After a double fault gave Seles a 4-2 lead, Capriati hurled her racket to the court, drawing a warning from the umpire. She won the next eight games.

in the galapagos islands of ecuador, the oil spill that threatens so many species of rare birds and animals is now the size of los angeles. cleanup teams are desperately trying to save the hundreds of endangered species. a tankeran aground last week off san cristobal island. and our ned potter is there tonight. this morning, the tanker was practically on its side, the waves breaking it off just 500 yards from san cristobal island. and despite their best efforts, officials said 200,000 gallons of engine fuel had already leaked from the hull. endangering sea lions, pelicans, crabs and other species. the best thing that you can do is take care of the oil here at the source of pollution, where it's concentrated. ed stanton heads a u.s. coast guard team, sent here at ecuador's request. from mobile, alabama, they're trying, against the odds, to pump any remaining fuel from the ship so that it won't spill into the ocean, too. you become sympathetic and empathetic with the people that are here. they've never experienced anything like this. and for them, it's an emotional turmoil. indeed, hundreds of people from around the galapagos gathered in the harbor here to help in any way they could. fishermen in their boats, trying to clean up the waters. others trying to clean up shorelines, saving birds, all by hand. how many animals have you cleaned off? this is the fourth one. the "jessica" was here to deliver fuel for tour boats, which bring many of the island's 45,000 visitors. in other words, the environment here was damaged, in part, because so many people come to marvel at it. the galapagos are hallowed ground to many scientists, for it was here that charles darwin derived his theory of natural selection. now many of the fish he saw are in danger because pollutants could sink and kill the algae on which underwater life depends. but late today, the news was encouraging -- that wind and currents were carrying most of the spill away from land. i have a mixture of anxiety about the situation, and ao relief, though. 've been lucky. lucky, but only up to a point. this place has suffered its worst crisis in decades, and found it itself almost helpless to protect itself. ned potter, abc news, on san cstobal in the galapagos islands.

As part of his successful last-minute bid for a pardon from President Clinton, Marc Rich, the commodities trader who had evaded prosecution for 18 years, received letters of support from dozens of politicians, financiers and officials of charitable organizations that were given to Clinton last month. While Clinton's pardon of Rich on Saturday stunned U.S. law-enforcement officials, the effort to obtain it was no secret to dozens of influential people in this country, Europe and Israel. The list of people who wrote letters for or about Rich in the last two months of 2000 is a virtual Who's Who of Israeli society and Jewish philanthropy. It includes Shabtai Shavit, a businessman who once headed Israel's secret intelligence arm; Zubin Mehta, the managing director of Israel's Philharmonic; two former mayors of Israeli cities; and several museum directors. More than 20 people joined Rich's ex-wife, Denise Rich, in addressing letters to Clinton seeking a pardon, and more than 50 others wrote letters to Rich or his charitable foundation simply attesting to his generosity. The letters were attached to a request for a pardon that was sent directly to Clinton in December by three lawyers representing Rich. The application makes no mention of contrition on the part of Rich, emphasizing instead his philanthropic efforts and the suffering it says he has endured in exile at Switzerland and Spain homes. The only blame is reserved for federal prosecutors and the lawyers who handled Rich's original defense, which, his current lawyers wrote, ``followed an unfortunate'' strategy of no communication and no negotiation. Rich and his former partner, Pincus Green, have lived in Europe since they fled the United States during an investigation into their oil-trading activities that led to a 1983 indictment on 51 counts of tax evasion, racketeering and violating sanctions against trading with Iran. Neither man is now a U.S. citizen, the application to Clinton says, though it does not address how that came about. The pardons granted to both men on Saturday eliminated the charges and freed them to return to the United States, said Robert F. Fink, a partner in the Manhattan law firm Piper, Marbury, Rudnick &AMP; Wolfe. Fink teamed with Jack Quinn, a former chief of staff to Vice President Al Gore and a former counsel to President Clinton, and Kathleen Behan, a lawyer in Washington. The pardon has drawn harsh criticism from prosecutors and former prosecutors, including Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who was the U.S. attorney in Manhattan when the men were charged. The first word of the pardon, which did not make the usual rounds inside the Justice Department, reached lawyers in the U.S. attorney's office on Saturday morning, leaving them ``shocked and absolutely flabbergasted,'' according to one person who works there. In their petition, Rich's lawyers argued that the ``recalcitrant and unreasonable refusal'' by the federal prosecutors to negotiate with them unless Rich returned left a presidential pardon as the only way to ``resolve the controversy.'' Clinton said on Sunday that Quinn had persuaded him to grant pardons to Rich and Green, but he did not elaborate and he referred questions to Quinn. Quinn referred calls to Fink, who said he believed the president had been convinced that the criminal charges against the men had not been justified. Denise Rich, a prominent fund-raiser for the Democratic Party, also called the White House to ask for a pardon for her ex-husband, Fink said. A spokesman for Denise Rich had said on Monday that she had not been involved in the effort to obtain a pardon and was surprised when it was granted. Tuesday, Denise Rich hired a new spokesman, Howard J. Rubenstein, and is said to be looking to hire a lawyer. Rubenstein said: ``Denise Rich is happy for her children that her ex-husband has been pardoned. Of course, she supported his application.'' Marc Rich's lawyers were able to call in favors from many high-level executives and officials in Israel who had crossed paths with Rich. ``Marc Rich has been one of our most important private individuals involved in the leading issues of our times,'' said Yaakov Neeman, Israel's finance minister, in a letter dated Nov. 29. Shavit, the head of Israel's intelligence arm, Mossad, from 1989 to 1996, and now a businessman, wrote a letter dated Nov. 28 in support of the application. ``As head of Mossad,'' he wrote, ``we requested his assistance in looking for MIAs and help in the rescue and evacuation of Jews from enemy countries.'' Many of the letters attesting to his years of good works were faxed to the attention of Avner Azulay at the Rich Foundation in Tel Aviv. For instance, Israel's Philharmonic ``has been privileged to enjoy a close and special friendship with the Rich Foundation,'' wrote Mehta on Nov. 20. No kindness was too small to recall: ``Thank you again for the air-conditioner for the blind couple,'' wrote Shlomo Lahat, the former mayor of Tel Aviv, on Nov. 26. Some letter writers could not resist including some dismay about gifts not made. Jonathan Halevy, the director-general of Shaare Zedek Hospital, acknowledged the gifts his organization received from 1981 to 1994 but could not resist adding, ``The hospital has regretfully received no further support from the foundation since 1994.''

The seven escaped convicts from Texas played loud Christian music in their cramped RV _ perhaps to make themselves look innocent and God-fearing _ and kept mostly to themselves as they hid out in this peaceful town for three weeks. At least one of the men attended Bible study sessions and befriended several residents, who were impressed with his knowledge of Scripture. Several frequented a coffee shop. Some even felt safe enough to go drinking and dancing in area nightclubs. But they kept their heads down while walking past others through the itinerant workers' mobile home park where their RV was parked. And at least two had disguised themselves by dyeing their hair. Woodland Park Police Sgt. Bill Sumner speculated the men played Christian music for well-calculated reasons. ``That's what I'd do in a heartbeat,'' Sumner said. ``The No. 1 way to look innocuous and innocent is to look real religious.'' He said he wasn't surprised the men melted into the town without arousing suspicion: ``They were pillars of the community for the time they were here.'' One of the biggest manhunts in the Southwest's history ended Monday for five of the convicts. Four were arrested peacefully and a fifth killed himself in the motor home at the Coachlight Motel and RV Park rather than surrender to law officers who had the place surrounded. The two other convicts remained at large Tuesday as state and federal officers pursued thousands of leads. A van used by the missing two was found abandoned in a Colorado Springs motel parking lot Tuesday, and authorities checked hotels for the men. The van was said to contain duffel bags, maps and hair color. Federal firearms charges were dismissed Tuesday against the four in custody to expedite their transfer to Texas, where they could face the death penalty on state murder charges in the slaying of a policeman during a holdup at a sporting goods store 11 days after they broke out of prison. Also Tuesday, a Colorado State Patrol trooper was killed in a crash while pursuing what turned out to be an inaccurate tip about the fugitives' van. The two convicts on the run _ Patrick Murphy Jr., a 39-year-old rapist, and armed robber Donald Newbury, 38 _ are believed to have 12 weapons, including assault rifles and shotguns, and may also have bulletproof vests. Teller County Undersheriff Kevin Dougherty said investigators do not believe there was any rift among the seven. ``It's our understanding that they left to break away from the group and to go out and do their own thing,'' he said. Inside the RV, officers found a ``personal note'' from Larry Harper, the convict who killed himself, to his family; the contents were not disclosed. Also found were $10,000 in cash, thousands of rounds of ammunition, two-way radios, a medical kit and receipts for bulletproof vests, recently purchased in Denver and Aurora, said Mark Mershon, FBI agent in the charge in Colorado. In addition, ``there were 35 weapons in there, loaded, cocked and ready for action, as we say,'' Mershon said. Some of the guns were taken from the Texas prison; others were traced to the sporting goods store, he said. After the discovery of the van, 11 schools in the Colorado Springs were locked down as a precaution and students were kept inside until the end of the school day. The seven fugitives broke out of a maximum-security prison in Kenedy, Texas, southeast of San Antonio, on Dec. 13. They were believed to have been in the Woodland Park area since around New Year's Day. Authorities were tipped off to their presence by residents who had seen the convicts featured on TV's ``America's Most Wanted.'' A $500,000 reward had been offered for information leading to the conviction of the officer's killer, but there was no immediate word on how or when that money might be distributed. The three convicts captured at a convenience store near the RV park were suspected ringleader George Rivas, 30, a kidnapper and burglar; and Michael Rodriguez, 38, and Joseph Garcia, 29, both murderers. Randy Halprin, 23, who had been serving time for beating an infant, surrendered a short time later at the motor home. Harper, 37, convicted of aggravated sexual assault, shot himself to death inside the motor home. Coachlight residents said Harper was a deeply religious person who attended Bible study with them. Michael Judd, 15, who lived with his family next door, said he thought the men were members of a music group. Authorities said Rodriguez had grown a full beard, Rivas had dyed his hair blond and wore sunglasses and a new goatee, and Garcia had dyed his hair orange and grown a goatee. Neighbors told authorities the men were seen leaving the park in small groups at all times of the day, apparently to run errands. Shane Denn, 30, who lives nearby, said he had seen the men several times while visiting friends, most recently on Saturday. ``There must have been five or six of them. They were carrying on like everything was normal,'' he said. ``I've been over there at least a dozen times since they checked in and never saw anything out of the ordinary.'' Authorities speculated the fugitives bought the motor home with some of the $70,000 stolen during the sporting goods store holdup. ___ On the Net: Texas Department of Criminal Justice: http://www.tdcj.state.tx.us Irving Police Department: http://www.irvingpd.com

Bad weather blocked oil cleanup efforts around a stricken tanker Tuesday, but fortuitous winds were pushing thousands of gallons of spilled oil away from the fragile environment of the Galapagos islands, officials said. Slicks from last week's diesel spill had spread over an area bigger than Los Angeles, and on Tuesday, pounding surf around the disabled tanker Jessica halted recovery operations: A giant wave washed over the ship's bow, injuring its captain and bruising several recovery workers. Despite the complications, though, nature was also providing a helping hand for the islands, an ecosystem populated by species found nowhere else in the world and an inspiration for Charles Darwin's theory of evolution. Ecuadorean Environment Minister Rodolfo Rendon said Tuesday that the spilled diesel had shifted direction ``toward the northwest, which is an open zone where there are no major islands.'' He said the spill, which officials have blamed on navigational error, was ``a problem, not a tragedy.'' The Galapagos chain _ consisting of 13 major islands, six small islands and scores of islets _ is 600 miles west of the Ecuadorean mainland and is the country's main tourist attraction. Despite the wind shift, the spill here has taken a toll on the chain's unique wildlife. Oil reached Santa Fe Island, 37 miles west of San Cristobal, the easternmost island in the Galapagos archipelago and home to large colonies of sea lions and marine iguanas. Rendon said one pelican had died and that the fuel had harmed some 40 other animals, including sea lions, seagulls, blue-footed boobies and albatrosses, which had been rescued and cleaned. Robert Bensted-Smith, director of the Charles Darwin Research Station, told The Associated Press that long-term damage was still being assessed. He said that beside the strong currents pushing the fuel out to sea, heavy sunshine had helped evaporate some of the oil. But, he said, there was evidence that an undetermined quantity sea urchins and seaweed had died on San Cristobal. One long-term threat of the spill is that the escaped fuel will sink to the ocean floor, destroying algae that is vital to the food chain. That could threaten marine iguanas, sharks, birds that feed off fish and other species, officials say. The Jessica, which ran aground Jan. 16 with about 243,000 gallons of fuel, was still listing sharply to its right in shallow waters about 550 yards from San Cristobal's shore. Some 170,000 gallons of diesel fuel have poured from the tanker. Ecuador, which controls the territory, declared a state of emergency late Monday to speed up funding for the cleanup. The leak began flowing through fissures in the ship's hull Friday. Before changing direction, it had been pushed by strong winds due west toward the center of the island chain. Efforts to recover some 10,000 gallons of remaining fuel and re-floating the 28-year-old tanker were suspended Tuesday due to bad weather. Ecuador Navy Capt. Francisco Andrade, commander of the naval base here, said a giant wave struck the ship late Monday, washing over several recovery workers, as well as the Jessica's captain, Tarquino Arevalo, who required stitches to close a gash on his head. ``The work can't continue with such strong breaking waves,'' said U.S. Coast Guard Capt. Edwin Stanton, head of a team of specialists who arrived Sunday from the United States to help in the recovery operation. The Galapagos islands shot to fame in the 19th century, when naturalist Charles Darwin developed his theory of evolution after studying the unique wildlife here. Formed roughly 4 to 5 million years ago by underwater volcanos, the islands are mostly arid and rocky, dotted more by cactuses than lush vegetation.

With oil spills now covering more than 775 square miles of normally pristine waters in the Galapagos Islands and continuing to spread, Ecuador has declared a state of emergency and is stepping up its efforts to prevent the slicks from contaminating habitats that are home to some of the world's rarest marine and bird species. To the relief of conservation and salvage teams that have been working in the area of the remote archipelago, a sudden shift in winds and sea currents appeared to be aiding those efforts Tuesday. As a result, most of the 144,000 gallons of spilled oil, which had been drifting westward toward islands with large animal populations, is being driven in a more northerly direction, away from inhabited areas. ``We seem to have avoided a tragedy, but we still have serious problems ahead of us,'' said Rodolfo Rendon, the environment minister of Ecuador, to which the Galapagos Islands belong. Because of the shift in wind and currents, he added, ``the levels of contamination are much lighter than had been expected'' just a few days ago. But the shift has also produced high waves, halting efforts to recover more fuel. The crisis began a week ago Tuesday, when an Ecuadorean tanker loaded with 243,000 gallons of diesel and bunker fuel went aground on a reef just off San Cristobal, the easternmost island of the archipelago. Rescue teams were able to remove some of the fuel, but on Friday night the vessel's cargo hold cracked, and oil began leaking into the Pacific Ocean. Compared with environmental disasters like the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill, which involved about 11 million gallons, the accident here is small. But the Galapagos Islands, situated about 600 miles off the Pacific coast of South America, are one of the most delicate environments in the world, full of species of marine iguanas, giant tortoises and penguins that are found nowhere else. It was precisely that exotic diversity of wildlife that led Darwin to the theory of natural selection and has made the Galapagos Islands a shrine for modern-day scientists. Visiting the islands in Sept. 1835, Darwin was struck by slight differences in finches and tortoises as he moved from one island to another, and he called the archipelago ``a little world within itself.'' Thus far, the damage to wildlife appears to have been minimal. The Charles Darwin Foundation, a private entity that operates the main scientific research station in the Galapagos and the www.galapagos.org Web site, reported Tuesday that only 16 juvenile sea lions, about 50 pelicans and 20 boobies had been affected by the slick. Scientists said that the longer the oil remained on the surface, the more it would block out the rays of the sun and oxygen vital to marine life, from plankton to fish. That could, they said, affect the entire food chain in the Galapagos Islands, with dire results for biodiversity in the archipelago. ``We have been relatively lucky so far, but it is still going to take us 30 months of work to be able to clean up this mess,'' Fernando Espinoza, secretary-general of the foundation, said in an interview here Tuesday. ``Right now we are diverting money from our other projects, but we estimate that the monitoring and recovery work is going to cost $1 million, and right now we don't have even one dollar of that.'' The devastating oil spill comes as Ecuador is in the midst of a furious national debate about the future of the islands, which are the country's main tourist attraction and one of the world's most important natural research laboratories. Late last year, local fishermen attacked conservation installations, blocked ports and harassed tourist groups in the islands to protest government limits on their lobster and sea cucumber harvest. Because much of the spilled fuel was destined for cruise boats that take foreign tourists from island to island to see rare wildlife, local fishermen have been quick to blame their adversaries in the Tourism and Environmental Ministries for the problem. In addition, the World Wide Fund for Nature is calling for limitations on commercial shipping in Galapagos waters, parts of which have already been designated a marine reserve. Environmental groups and the local press have also been critical of the Ecuadorean government's handling of various aspects of the crisis. Local press reports said that rescue vessels were slow to leave the mainland and that cleanup efforts were initially delayed because of disputes over who would pay the costs and how to dispose of the spilled fuel. ``The Ecuadorean state was not prepared for this and was slow in responding when it did happen,'' said Ricardo Moreno, executive director of the Fundacion Natura, the country's leading environmentalist group. ``As a result, we lost precious time after the ship ran aground in which it might have been possible to avoid the spill altogether.'' Ecuadorean officials have said the accident was the result of human error, with the captain of the tanker, the Jessica, confusing a buoy for a lighthouse. There have also been questions raised about the seaworthiness of the vessel, which was at least 30 years old, did not have oil spill insurance and yet was permitted by inspectors from the Ecuadorean merchant marine to set sail. Rendon said Tuesday that ``some lapses could exist'' in government inspection procedures, and that an investigation of every aspect of the accident was under way. But, he added, ``On the part of the Ecuadorean government, we have been fulfilling our responsibility.''

One Williams down, one to go for Martina Hingis. The top-seeded Hingis spoiled a potential sibling showdown at the Australian Open by winning a sloppy but dramatic marathon from Serena Williams 6-2, 3-6, 8-6 to complete the women's quarterfinals Wednesday. Williams' sister, Venus, earlier overcame a slow start and a late deficit to edge Amanda Coetzer in another extended third set, 2-6, 6-1, 8-6. In Thursday's semifinals, Hingis will renew her rivalry with the third-seeded Venus Williams, who needs two more victories for her third consecutive Grand Slam tournament title. Hingis leads the matchup 9-7, but Williams won both meetings last year en route to titles at Wimbledon and the U.S. Open. Defending champion Lindsay Davenport, seeded second, will play No. 12 Jennifer Capriati in the other semifinal. Serena Williams, who often blames health problems for her defeats, said a bout of food poisoning contributed to the latest loss. ``I wasn't at my best or feeling my best, so I'm pretty disappointed,'' she said in a statement. ``I did well considering I haven't eaten in two days, apart from some piece of toast here and there.'' Williams consulted with a trainer during several changeovers after the first set, and she grimaced or bent over in apparent discomfort after a few points. Hingis trailed 4-1 in the final set and was two points from defeat at 5-4, deuce. But she broke Williams' serve to reach 5-5, then broke again in the final game, winning the second match point with an overhead smash. ``It was a great comeback,'' Hingis said. ``I was just trying to hang in there. I wasn't feeling that great.'' Williams struggled with her serve and committed 54 errors, 29 in the final set. But Hingis needed 2 hours, 19 minutes to secure the victory. ``It was a great effort by both of us, and I was lucky,'' Hingis said. She's bidding for her sixth Grand Slam tournament title but her first in two years. Three times Hingis has defeated one Williams sister and then lost to the other in the same event, most recently at the 1999 U.S. Open, when Serena beat her in the final. Only twice has a player beaten both sisters in the same tournament: Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario at Sydney in 1998 and Monica Seles at Sydney in 1999. It was almost a Coetzer-Hingis semifinal. Venus Williams trailed Coetzer 5-3 in the final set and won despite a whopping 56 unforced errors. ``I pretty much fought for everything I got,'' Venus Williams said. ``Toward the end I cut down on my errors and moved forward. I had been in that situation many times before. I had the experience of being in the hole.'' Defending men's champ Andre Agassi, seeded sixth, will play No. 12 Patrick Rafter in the men's semifinals Thursday night. Rafter reached the final four in his country's biggest tournament for the first time by beating No. 14 Dominik Hrbaty 6-2, 6-7 (4), 7-5, 6-0 Tuesday night. No. 5 Yevgeny Kafelnikov was the top-seeded player remaining in the other half of the draw. Venus Williams is 11 inches taller than the 5-foot-2 Coetzer and hits her serves 25 mph faster, which made their pairing look like a mismatch. For a while it was. Coetzer, seeded 10th, was content to keep the ball in play and wait for errors by an erratic Williams, who lost the first eight points, lost 16 of the first 19 and fell behind 4-0. In the first set she committed 19 errors and hit just one winner. ``Let's go, Venus, wake up!'' a fan shouted. She did, holding serve with an ace to start the second set, then breaking for the first time when Coetzer double-faulted. Mistakes began to creep into the South African's game, while Williams tamed her wild strokes somewhat. ``I really had to pick myself up if I wanted to stay in the tournament,'' Williams said. ``I don't like to lose, and I just really didn't want to.'' But the rallies became especially sloppy down the stretch. Coetzer served for the victory at 5-3 but quickly committed four unforced errors and lost the game. Williams then had a chance to serve it out at 6-5 but won only one point, double-faulted and hit three groundstrokes wide to lose the game. Williams broke again, then concluded the ragged victory with an overhead winner. She smiled and sagged her shoulders in relief at her second consecutive three-set win. ``Today,'' she admitted, ``was not one of my better days.'' The start of the match was delayed half an hour by a shower that caught tournament officials by surprise. Play began after the retractable center court roof was closed for only the second time in the tournament. Asked about playing indoors, Williams said she regretted wearing a cap during the match. ``It affected my hairstyle,'' she said. ``If I had known they were going to close the roof, I would have worn a ponytail.''

A stricken tanker that had spilled some 170,000 gallons of diesel into the waters off the Galapagos Islands has dumped its remaining fuel into this fragile marine environment. An estimated 15,000 to 20,000 gallons of additional fuel was spilled late Tuesday, apparently after pounding surf caused new breaks in the hull of the tanker Jessica, officials said. How much of an environmental setback the additional spill represented was not immediately clear. Officials scattered dispersants and established a perimeter of floating containment buoys. ``We have taken all precautions to confront this situation,'' said Eliecer Cruz, director of the Galapagos National Park. The Jessica, which ran aground Jan. 16 with about 243,000 gallons of fuel, was listing sharply to its right in shallow waters about 550 yards from San Cristobal Island, the easternmost island in the archipelago. Some 35 workers were in small motor boats late Tuesday, trying to skim the rolling tidal waters to retrieve as much of the spilled fuel as possible, Cruz said. A team of pollution-control experts from the U.S. Coast Guard arrived Sunday and helped recover about 10,000 gallons of fuel from the tanker. But pounding surf prompted suspension of recovery operations after a giant wave washed over the Jessica's bow, injuring the tanker's captain and bruising several Ecuadorean recovery workers. The U.S. Coast Guard team was still on the island Wednesday and planned to remain, probably until next Tuesday, to offer assistance and technical advice, said spokesman Lt. Shawn Tripp from the U.S. Coast Guard air station in Clearwater, Fla. Slicks from last week's diesel spill had spread to fill an area bigger than Los Angeles. Earlier Tuesday, it had appeared that nature was providing a helping hand for the islands _ an ecosystem populated by species found nowhere else in the world and an inspiration for Charles Darwin's theory of evolution. Ecuadorean Environment Minister Rodolfo Rendon said that fortuitous winds and strong currents had shifted the direction of the spilled diesel to the northwest, where there are no major islands. He said the spill, which officials have blamed on navigational error, was ``a problem, not a tragedy.'' The Galapagos, 600 miles west of the Ecuadorean mainland, is that country's main tourist attraction. Despite the wind shift, the spill here has taken a toll on the chain's unique wildlife. Oil reached Santa Fe Island, 37 miles west of San Cristobal, the easternmost island in the Galapagos archipelago and home to large colonies of sea lions and marine iguanas. Rendon said one pelican had died and that the fuel had harmed some 40 other animals, including sea lions, seagulls, blue-footed boobies and albatrosses, which had been rescued and cleaned. Robert Bensted-Smith, director of the Charles Darwin Research Station, said that long-term damage was still being assessed. He said that beside the strong currents pushing the fuel out to sea, strong sunshine had helped evaporate some of the oil. But, he said, there was evidence that an undetermined quantity of sea urchins and seaweed had died on San Cristobal. One long-term threat is that the escaped fuel will sink to the ocean floor, destroying algae that is vital to the food chain. That could threaten marine iguanas, sharks, birds that feed off fish and other species, officials say. Ecuador declared a state of emergency late Monday to speed up funding for the cleanup.

a stricken tanker that caused a 170,000 gallon oil spill has dumped its remaining fuel into the ocean near the galapagos islands. the last 15,000 to 20,000 gallons of fuel spilled yesterday, after pounding waves caused new breaks in the hull of the tanker. bad weather is hindering efforts to clean up the spill. but winds are pushing the slick away from land, sparing some of the islands' unique wildlife. the long-term threat from the spill is still being evaluated. one known danger is in the destruction of algae on the ocean floor, which is vital to the islands' food chain.

The last two of seven fugitives from a maximum security prison in Texas were apprehended early Wednesday morning in Colorado Springs, ending a 42-day nationwide search. Tracked down at a Holiday Inn where they negotiated the terms of their surrender with law enforcement officials for more than five hours, the last two fugitives _ Patrick Murphy Jr. and Donald Newbury _ walked out of the motel peacefully and were taken in separate cars to the El Paso County jail. The inmates, who staged an elaborate escape from the Connally Unit in Kenedy, Texas, on Dec. 13, are suspects in the slaying of a police officer in Irving, Texas, 11 days after their escape. As part of the surrender agreement, the men were allowed to speak for five minutes each with a Colorado Springs television reporter. Both complained about the Texas prison system, citing it as the reason they escaped. Their capture concluded one of the nation's most intense manhunts in recent years. Four of the escapees were apprehended on Monday in Woodland Park, Colo., a small community about 20 miles northwest of Colorado Springs, where the seven had been living in a motor home at the Coachlight Motel and R.V. Park since Jan. 1. Three of the men _ Joseph Garcia, Michael Anthony Rodriguez and George Rivas _ were captured as they drove to a convenience store. The fourth, Randy Halprin, gave himself up later, walking out of the motor home. Several hours later, Larry Harper, another escapee, killed himself inside the motor home after officers had tried to talk him into surrendering. Police officials in Colorado Spring and in Irving said their first priority was arranging the extradition of the men to Texas to face charges in the killing of the police officer. The officer was killed during the robbery of a sporting goods store. Officer David Tull, of the Irving force, said police also were investigating whether anyone helped the convicts while they were on the run. In the interview with KKTV, Murphy said he was ``forced'' to escape because of the prison system, and in breaking out was trying to make a statement that ``there is a definite wrong within the penal system of the state of Texas.'' Newbury said, ``The judicial system in the state of Texas has really gone to the pits. We're receiving 99 years for a robbery for $68 and nobody's injured.'' He said, ``They're giving kids so much time that they will never get to see light again. Their life is gone. Now all they are is a roach in a cage. Things have to be changed. There has to be more rehabilitation in the system down there.'' Tull rejected those statements. ``I don't see that they are the victims,'' he said. ``We buried the victims.'' According to Texas authorities, Garcia had been serving a 50-year sentence for murder; Halprin, 30 years for injury to a child after he savagely beat up an infant; Harper, 50 years for aggravated assault and sexual assault; Murphy, a 50-year sentence for aggravated assault with a deadly weapon; Newbury, a life sentence for aggravated robbery with a deadly weapon; Rivas, five years for burglary and kidnapping, and Rodriguez, a life sentence for capital murder. The captured inmates also described how they strove to elude detection at the mobile home park for three weeks. They did so ``just by downplaying ourselves and changing our hair color and such,'' Murphy said. ``We attempted to be as friendly and neighborly as we could.'' Harper, he said, attended ``Christian meetings'' as a guise ``to pass us off as like a church work group traveling around.'' Investigators said Tuesday they were still piecing together how the men traveled undetected from Texas, why they chose Woodland Park for their hideout, and what they did during three weeks there. Marilyn Murray, who lives with her three teen-age sons next door to where the fugitives' 34-foot motor home was parked, said she and her sons saw the men frequently. ``They told people they were here to attend a religious convention,'' Murray said in an interview Tuesday. ``Whenever they would go outside to work on a vehicle, they would play religious music.'' The whereabouts of the seven were a mystery until last Sunday, after residents of the Coachlight watched the television program, ``America's Most Wanted,'' and notified local authorities that the Texas Seven, as they had come to be known, were living among them. Tull praised the help the police received from the public. ``The public is who called these tips in,'' he said. ``The system works, folks.'' No details have yet been worked out on how to grant $500,000 in reward money, he said. ``Rest assured that money is there for a purpose,'' he said. In the motor home, authorities said they found 35 loaded weapons, including handguns, assault weapons and sawed-off shotguns along with thousands of rounds of ammunition, thousands of dollars in cash and receipts from stores in Denver and one of its a suburbs, Aurora, for the purchase of bullet-proof vests. Tom Strickland, the U.S. attorney for Colorado, said at a news conference that the authorities in Texas and Colorado had agreed to drop all federal charges against the men in custody to expedite their extradition to Texas.

COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. (AP) _ KKTV-TV anchor Eric Singer became part of the news Wednesday. Singer interviewed Texas fugitives Patrick Murphy Jr. and Donald Newbury by phone for 10 minutes in a live broadcast as part of a deal negotiated by police for the men's surrender. ``This is the most important story I've ever been a part of,'' said Singer, 43. ``I never in my wildest dreams ever imagined that I would play a role like this.'' After the interviews, at about 3:45 a.m., Murphy, a 39-year-old rapist, and Newbury, a 38-year-old robber, walked out of the hotel room where they had been holed up during about five hours of negotiations with police. Officers took the pair to jail. The men were among seven inmates who broke out of a maximum-security prison in Kenedy, Texas, on Dec. 13. Four were arrested Monday in nearby Woodland Park. A fifth killed himself as authorities closed in. Singer, who anchors KKTV's evening newscasts, learned at about 10:30 p.m. Tuesday that Murphy and Newbury might be holed up at a Holiday Inn two blocks from where their van had been found. He remained at the station, breaking into programming three times with updates. At 11:30 p.m., negotiators told the station the fugitives wanted to make a statement either on KKTV _ a CBS affiliate _ or a national cable channel before giving up. Singer said the fugitives apparently had been watching his station. Negotiators asked Singer to do the interview; he said he did not know why they chose him. Negotiators decided that each fugitive would have five minutes to make a statement and answer questions from Singer. The anchor said negotiators did not suggest any questions, but an FBI agent sat off-camera and timed the interviews. ``I was just a small part of this. Let's make this clear. The negotiating team set the stage. ... My job was to do the best I could to not exacerbate the situation,'' Singer said. Aly Colon, a media researcher at the Poynter Institute in St. Petersburg, Fla., said broadcasting the interview at the request of either the negotiators or the fugitives raises questions about the news media's independence. ``If you allow outside groups to dictate the manner in which the news is disseminated, it undermines the position of the news media as an evaluator and independent broker of the information,'' he said. KKTV news director Brian Rackham said his station decided to air the interview because it might help end the standoff with no loss of life, and because it was an important story. ``I think their (the fugitives') perspective was interesting. We may not agree with it, but it certainly is part of the story,'' he told Fox News Channel. Texas prison system spokesman Larry Todd said the negotiators made the right decision to allow the interview. ``Let them have their 15 minutes of fame, because the people watching television know what slime balls they are,'' Todd said. ___ On the Net: KKTV-TV: http://www.kktv.com

The day's easiest shot was the last one. A weary Martina Hingis stood two steps from the net, looking up at the roof of Rod Laver Arena and waiting patiently for Serena Williams' weak lob to descend. Hingis cocked her racket and slapped an overhead into the corner, putting the ball and the match out of Williams' reach. The dramatic 6-2, 3-6, 8-6 victory Wednesday gave Hingis a place in the Australian Open semifinals and required 2 hours, 19 minutes of dogged persistence. ``I definitely lost some weight today,'' she said with a smile. Her dubious reward was a match Thursday against Serena's sister, Venus. But win or lose in the semis, Hingis can draw encouragement from her second win this month over the younger Williams. ``You can't count on just overpowering me anymore,'' said Hingis, who has won five Grand Slam titles but none since January 1999. ``I was able to stay in the game and just hit groundstrokes with her, which I had a little bit of trouble with in the past.'' The victory gave the top-seeded Hingis a chance to beat both Williams sisters in the same tournament, something she has never done. Venus, seeded third, advanced by outlasting No. 10 Amanda Coetzer 2-6, 6-1, 8-6. In a surprising twist, the men's final will include a Frenchman for the first time since 1928. No. 15-seeded Arnaud Clement and No. 16 Sebastien Grosjean, friends since childhood, won Wednesday and will stage an all-France semifinal Friday. ``We grew up together. We've played a lot together,'' Clement said. ``To be playing in the semifinals is unbelievable.'' Grosjean beat Carlos Moya 6-1, 6-4, 6-2. Clement then upset No. 5 Yevgeny Kafelnikov 6-4, 5-7, 7-6 (3), 7-6 (3). Clement celebrated by throwing his bandanna, his shirt and both shoes to the crowd, then taking off his socks and tossing them aside. Defending champion Andre Agassi, seeded sixth, was to play No. 12 Pat Rafter of Australia in the other semifinal Thursday night. A rainstorm Wednesday forced the closing of the retractable roof over center court, and thunder accompanied the booming groundstrokes of Williams and Hingis. At times they whacked the ball wildly _ especially the sixth-seeded Williams, who made 54 unforced errors. She blamed the defeat on food poisoning, saying she barely ate for two days leading up to the match. ``I wasn't at my best or feeling my best, so I'm pretty disappointed,'' she said. Hingis wasn't too sympathetic. Williams has a habit of complaining about her health when she loses, and she made it through three sets of doubles after losing in singles. ``You have to watch what you eat,'' Hingis said. ``You have to become a little bit professional about that. ... I couldn't really tell she had food poisoning. I think it was more that I wore her out.'' Such is the nature of the relationship between the two brash youngsters, which helps explain why both fought so fiercely to the finish. Hingis rallied from a 4-1 deficit in the final set, closing to 4-all with a backhand lob over Williams that kissed the sideline on break point. Williams was two points from victory serving at 5-4, deuce, but Hingis again pulled even. There were several rallies of at least a dozen strokes, sometimes with two or three shots landing on a line during a single point as the crowd gasped before erupting with another roar. When Hingis scrambled to hit a forehand winner and save a break point serving at 5-5, even Williams' mother applauded. The best exchange came the first time Hingis reached match point. She charged the net, but Williams lofted a lob over her head. Hingis frantically retreated to the corner, wheeled and smacked a crosscourt forehand that looked like a winner. But Williams' lunging backhanded stab deflected the ball back across the net for the point. The second match point ended with Hingis' putaway. She and Williams shook hands at the net and shared a smile _ a friendly finish to the sometimes acrimonious rivalry. ``It was a great match from both of us, at the end especially,'' Hingis said. ``The third set was very good tennis.'' Williams _ no surprise here _ was unfazed by the defeat. The loss reminded her of 1999, when she was eliminated in the third round at Melbourne and later won the U.S. Open. ``I told Venus, `The last time I lost a match like this at the Australian Open, I went on to dominate,''' Williams said. ``I guess we know what to expect from now on.''

The captain and crew of a tanker that spilled at least 185,000 gallons of diesel into this fragile marine environment have been arrested, officials said Wednesday. Capt. Tarquino Arevalo and his 13 crewmen were detained in Puerto Baquerizo on San Cristobal Island, Ecuadorean merchant marine Vice Adm. Gonzalo Vega said. ``I have requested penalties of prison for the vessel's captain and for the company (owners),'' said Ecuadorean Environment Minister Rodolfo Rendon. Formal charges have yet to be filed. Authorities said convictions on charges of negligence and crimes against the environment could carry prison sentences of up to two to four years. The tanker Jessica, which started leaking fuel three days after it ran aground Jan. 16 off San Cristobal Island, spilled the last of its cargo late Tuesday, apparently after pounding surf caused new ruptures in its hull. Capt. Ramiro Morejon, chief of control and marine monitoring for Galapagos National Park, said the ship ran aground because a signal buoy had been mistaken for a lighthouse. The tanker regularly transported diesel and bunker, a heavy fuel used by tour boats, into the Galapagos from the mainland. It carried some 234,000 gallons of fuel when it hit bottom 550 yards off San Cristobal, the easternmost island in the Galapagos archipelago. An international team of recovery workers had stemmed the leak, but not before some 170,000 gallons escaped into the water. About 50,000 gallons more were unloaded from the ship before spilling. Workers suspended operations and were waiting out rough tides when the ship's remaining cargo _ an estimated 15,000 to 20,000 gallons of fuel _ spilled out late Tuesday. How much of an environmental setback the additional spill represented was not immediately clear. Officials scattered dispersants and established a perimeter of floating containment buoys. ``We have taken all precautions to confront this situation,'' said Eliecer Cruz, director of the Galapagos National Park. A U.S. Coast Guard team helped recover about 10,000 gallons of fuel from the tanker. Earlier Tuesday, it had appeared that nature was providing a helping hand for the islands _ an ecosystem populated by species found nowhere else in the world and an inspiration for Charles Darwin's theory of evolution. Authorities said fortuitous winds and strong currents had shifted the direction of the spilled diesel to the northwest, where there are no major islands. The Galapagos, 600 miles west of the Ecuadorean mainland, is the country's main tourist attraction. Despite the wind shift, the spill has taken a toll on the chain's unique wildlife.

High tides and heavy winds on Wednesday forced the suspension of efforts to recover diesel and bunker fuel leaking from a grounded tanker that has already spilled more than 150,000 gallons into pristine waters teeming with some of the world's most unusual marine and bird species. The result was a new oil slick that has already killed off fish and marine organisms and plants in the area around the ship. More ominously, officials here said, the new spill threatens to drift toward neighboring islands that have large populations of sea lions, marine iguanas and blue-footed boobies. Despite the pounding surf, cleanup and animal-rescue efforts by Ecuador, which has governed the archipelago since the middle of the last century, were continuing. About 100 employees of the Galapagos National Park have been joined by scientists from the Charles Darwin Research Station, local fishermen, volunteers and a U.S. Coast Guard team. ``Given the circumstances, they have been doing a fantastic job,'' said Capt. Edwin Stanton, the commander of the Coast Guard unit, which arrived here on San Cristobal Island on Sunday at the request of Ecuadorean government. ``What they lack in equipment and infrastructure, they are making up for in innovation and sheer effort.'' The environmental peril in the Galapagos Islands, designated a world heritage site by the United Nations because of its unusual wildlife, began Jan. 16 when a tanker loaded with 243,000 gallons of fuel went aground on a reef just as it was preparing to dock. Rescue teams were able to remove some of the oil, but on Friday night the hull cracked and the fuel began leaking into the Pacific Ocean. Fernando Espinoza, secretary-general of the Charles Darwin Foundation, said the main spill, now dispersed over more than 775 square miles, has already reached Santa Cruz, which is about 50 miles northwest of here and is the most populated island. On Wednesday, residents there were busy trying to remove oil from the shores of Tortuga Bay, a popular beach, and the harbor at Puerto Ayora, the main settlement. Scientists and government officials said the original spill is so widely dispersed that in many areas it is merely a sheen. That has helped speed evaporation and reduced the chance of extensive permanent damage to the delicate environment, which inspired Darwin to develop the theory of natural selection when he visited here in 1835. Eliecer Cruz, director of the national park, said that because of unpredictable and shifting winds and currents, it was too early to determine where the new, much smaller slick from Wednesday's spill might be heading. But he expressed concern at signs that it might be headed south, toward islands with large populations of rare animals, including Espanola, the sole nesting place of the waved albatross. On Wednesday afternoon the stricken tanker, the Jessica, could still be seen listing to starboard at a 50-degree angle about 500 yards offshore. ``The vessel took a severe pounding Tuesday and today,'' Stanton said. ``We could hear the bulkheads popping.'' Ecuadorean navy officials said that they would attempt to right the vessel on Thursday in an effort to halt the leakage. But the navy has only three small tugboats here, and it is not clear whether the tugboats will have the strength required to right the vessel. Assessment of responsibility for the spill is just beginning, and on Wednesday Vice Adm. Gonzalo Vega of the merchant marine announced the arrest of the Jessica's captain, Tarquino Arevalo, and 13 crewmen, who were ordered confined to a military base on San Cristobal pending formal charges, The Associated Press reported. Local fishermen, who have been fighting with the government about quotas for lobster and sea-cucumber catches in recent months, have been using buckets to skim oil from the surface. ``We are the ones who are most affected by this tragedy, and we don't want to be blamed for any drop-off in the fish population,'' said Franklin Zavala, president of the local fishermen's cooperative. Conspicuously absent from the cleanup efforts, however, was the Galapagos Explorer, the tourist cruise ship that had been scheduled to receive much of the leaked fuel. ``There has been no offer from the owners to help, even though other tourism companies have offered their vessels as floating dormitories for our recovery teams or are raising money for relief efforts,'' Cruz said. Dedicated surfers are still flocking to San Cristobal, drawn by a large storm farther out in the Pacific. ``Today was the worst day since I arrived,'' said Armando Maciel, a Brazilian surfer who has spent three weeks here. ``The water gave off an awful, overpowering smell when it crashed onto the rocks. I had to give up and get out of the water.''

Former CIA Director John M. Deutch agreed last Friday to plead guilty to a misdemeanor for mishandling government secrets, but President Clinton pardoned him before the Justice Department could file the case against him, officials said Wednesday. Deutch was among 176 people granted some form of clemency by Clinton just hours before he left office on Saturday. Clinton's pardon for Deutch said it was ``those offenses described in the Jan. 19, 2001 information.'' But Justice officials said the department did not file a criminal information in court against Deutch on that day _ last Friday. An information is used to file charges almost exclusively in cases where defendants have reached a plea bargain with prosecutors and thus have waived their right to have a grand jury consider the charges and agreed to have them filed directly with the court in a criminal information. Federal officials said last Friday that Deutch was near a plea bargain with prosecutors in which he would plead guilty to a misdemeanor but not be sentenced to any time in prison for keeping secrets on his unsecured home computers, which were linked to the Internet. A federal law enforcement official, requesting anonymity, said Wednesday that Deutch signed the agreement Friday but too late to file it in court that day. The next time it could have been filed was Monday but in the meantime, Clinton issued the pardon Saturday. Justice officials have declined to release the information or any plea bargain documents and say there is no reason to file them in court now the Deutch has been pardoned for the offense. The timing illustrates the hasty nature of some of Clinton's last-minute pardons, but has little or no practical effect on Deutch because even if the charges had been filed and his plea taken earlier, he would still have avoided incarceration and gotten a presidential pardon. A pardon releases a person from the punishment of a crime. States have different criteria for restoring the individual rights of those granted presidential pardons. Presidents have the power to pardon citizens for offenses before those citizens are charged with any offenses, as President Ford did in pardoning his predecessor, President Nixon, for any crimes he may have committed in the Watergate scandal. Deutch's attorney, Terrence O'Donnell did not return calls seeking his comment. Deutch, CIA director from May 1995 to December 1996, stored and processed hundreds of files of highly classified material on unprotected home computers that he and family members also used to connect to the Internet, according to an internal CIA investigation. The Defense Department's inspector general found similar conduct during Deutch's prior service at the Pentagon. Now a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Deutch was stripped of his security clearances by CIA director George Tenet in 1999. As a former deputy defense secretary, Deutch also had Pentagon clearances, but he voluntarily gave them up last year.

Yemeni authorities on Wednesday investigated how an armed hijacker boarded a commercial flight carrying the U.S. ambassador and 90 other people, while the government sought his return from Djibouti. What began as a domestic flight Tuesday ended up in the Horn of Africa nation of Djibouti, where crew members overpowered the hijacker after the pilot reportedly distracted him so passengers could escape down emergency chutes. All the passengers fled safely. Yemenia Airlines officials said a crew member was slightly injured in the struggle with the hijacker, and there conflicting reports on whether the hijacker was injured. After a luncheon Wednesday honoring the flight crew, the pilot, Capt. Amer Anis, described the hijacking as ``terrible.'' His co-pilot, Rosa Abdul-Khaliq _ Yemenia's only woman pilot _ said her crew ``did perfect.'' Both declined to comment further on what happened aboard the Boeing 727. The Interior Ministry identified the hijacker as Mohammed Yehia Ali Sattar, a Yemeni. U.S. Ambassador Barbara Bodine, advisers and the Yemeni ambassador to Washington, Abdulwahab Al Hajjri, were taking the regularly scheduled flight to Taiz to meet with President Ali Abdullah Saleh. The meeting was to have focused on U.S.-Yemeni security cooperation and the Oct. 12 terrorist attack that killed 17 USS Cole sailors while the destroyer was refueling off Yemen. U.S. officials have said the hijacker apparently did not know the dignitaries were aboard. Bodine, who returned to San'a after the hijacking, has declined comment. Interior Ministry sources said Wednesday that the hijacking appeared to be an attempt to draw attention to perceived injustices against Iraq and its president, Saddam Hussein. The hijacker, armed with a small gun resembling a pen, demanded to be flown to Baghdad. The United Nations has kept Iraq under economic sanctions since its 1990 invasion of Kuwait, which led to the Persian Gulf War. Yemeni-Iraqi relations long have been friendly, and interest in lifting sanctions and reincorporating Iraq into the international community has been growing throughout the Arab world. Investigators were looking into whether the hijacker acted alone or was backed by others, one of the Interior Ministry sources said. Another said there was no indication anyone at the airport helped the hijacker board the plane, but that investigators were probing whether there were security lapses. Yemenia's deputy managing director, Amin al-Haimy, praised the crew's actions. In Djibouti, when the hijacker realized the passengers were gone, he became agitated, but the crew was able to control him, al-Haimy said. One of two flight engineers aboard, al-Haimy said, sprayed the hijacker with a powerful stream of foam from a fire extinguisher. Another crew member helped wrestle him down. The flight engineer was shot in the arm during the struggle, but al-Haimy said the injury was slight. The hijacker had claimed to have weapons other than the small gun, but none were found, al-Haimy said. Djibouti authorities have said the hijacker was hospitalized with a gunshot wound apparently inflicted by his own weapon. Al-Haimy, however, said the hijacker was not shot, though he may have been injured by blows. A Yemeni diplomatic source in the capital said Yemen has asked Djibouti to turn over the hijacker. The timing of any handover wasn't certain, however, because of legal procedures involved and because Djibouti investigators also are probing the case, an Interior Ministry source said. Both sources spoke on condition of anonymity.

The impact of a projected slowdown in the U.S. economy, new ways for companies to do business and the changing face of the Internet are all issues to be tackled at a meeting of politicians, businessmen and cultural leaders opening Thursday. The World Economic Forum _ 3,200 politicians, business people and cultural leaders _ will stretch over six days and 315 sessions at this Alpine resort. In a program dominated by technology issues, the forum, in its 31st year, will be looking at how to ensure parts of the world are not left behind and the future of e-commerce following the collapse of some major ``dot com'' companies. The summit will also play host to Balkan leaders hoping to sketch a new economic map, including the possible creation of a customs union. New faces such as Yugoslavia's Vojislav Kostunica and Mexico's Vicente Fox will have ample chance to meet counterparts in meetings on the sidelines. The summit, whose motto is ``committed to improving the state of the world,'' sees itself as a chance for the world's decision makers to get together in a relaxed atmosphere _ with a break for skiing. International trade will be high on the agenda, with the present and future heads of the World Trade Organization, Mike Moore and Supachai Panitchpakdi, facing up to some of the organization's most vocal critics at round-table events. For a bit of relaxation, participants can also attend literary teas, listen to music from Peter Gabriel or Youssou N'Dour and even learn the techniques of ``yoga for the hands.'' Not, however, if globalization opponents have their way. They intend to go through with protests despite a ban on demonstrations, which they said Wednesday they would appeal to the Swiss Supreme Court. To them, the summit is a symbol of all that's worst about globalization: worldwide markets and the increasing importance of international trade. For the organizers, the forum represents all that's best about exactly the same things. They point to the diversity of the delegates _ more than 30 heads of state or government and other politicians, including Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and former Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres, as well as business leaders such as Microsoft founder Bill Gates, and the heads of almost every U.N. agency. Though some U.S. governors are attending, there is no one from the administration of newly inaugurated President Bush. The forum features ``the major stakeholders of society gathered in one place at the same time,'' says Charles McLean, the forum's communications director. ``What a wonderful opportunity that offers.'' Protesters are coming well prepared. Even if the ban is upheld, they say they will have more than the 1,000 protesters who showed up last year. ``We want to prevent these self-titled 'global leaders' from meeting behind closed doors to decide the future of the planet to their favor,'' according to a statement by Anti-WTO Coordination, the group leading the protests. Last year's protests turned violent, with two police officers injured and protesters damaging a local McDonald's. Swiss police have called in reinforcements from across Switzerland and Liechtenstein and drafting in 600 soldiers. On Wednesday, they set up barriers on the main streets of Davos _ a usually quiet upmarket ski resort. The United States, concerned about possible violent protests, has advised U.S. citizens to avoid Davos during the event. Meanwhile, in an advice booklet, the protesters suggest demonstrators carry gas masks and items they may need if they are arrested. It advises against bringing contact lenses and the liquid solutions they require: ``You can be arrested for carrying chemical agents.'' ___ On the Net: Forum official site, http://www.weforum.org Protesters' site, http://www.bermuda.ch/reitschule/anti-wto/english/index.shtml

El Salvador's devastating earthquake _ not deforestation _ was the principal cause of a landslide that killed more than 300 people in a neighborhood near the capital, officials said Wednesday. The Jan. 13 earthquake caused a mountainside to collapse, burying the suburban neighborhood of Las Colinas. The collapse renewed allegations that recent construction had cleared too many trees and made the area vulnerable to landslides. Before the magnitude-7.6 quake, environmentalists had asked Congress _ and municipal officials had asked the Supreme Court _ to block the construction of hillside mansions above Las Colinas. Congress didn't respond, the Supreme Court last year denied the petition, and construction continued. Several estates, complete with swimming pools and gatehouses, were built above the middle-class neighborhood. They were also destroyed in the landslide. On Wednesday, officials released a report saying there was no evidence that deforestation was to blame. However, Public Works Minister Carlos Pollincen said more studies were needed. ``As of now, there is nothing that makes us think that anything other than the earthquake caused the landslide,'' he said. The study was carried out by geologist Edwin Harp and vulcanologist James Vallance, members of the U.S. Geological Survey. The two also found that other earthquakes or the upcoming rainy season could cause more landslides, and they recommended that residents wait to rebuild. Officials have prevented more than 20,000 people from returning to the area around Las Colinas, saying more landslides are possible. The earthquake killed a total of 726 people in El Salvador and six others in Guatemala.

As rangers worked Wednesday to net wildlife stained and dazed by an oil spill, authorities arrested the captain of the leaking tanker and pledged stronger protections for these islands renowned for their unique animals and birds. Capt. Tarquino Arevalo and 13 crewmen from the tanker Jessica were ordered confined to a military base on San Cristobal island pending formal charges, Merchant Marines Vice Adm. Gonzalo Vega said Wednesday. Arevalo and the tanker's owners could face two to four years in prison if convicted of negligence or crimes against the environment. Ecuadorean Environment Minister Rodolfo Rendon said he was pushing to have them all jailed pending the investigation. Officials have said the Jessica ran aground after a signal buoy was mistaken for a lighthouse. They blamed human error _ an allegation Arevalo admitted to in an interview with the British Broadcasting Corp. He said he confused two landmarks, leading to the accident. ``It's very, very hard,'' he said in the interview aired Wednesday and posted on the BBC Web site. ``I know what's happened but what can I do now?'' Arevalo said he has not slept since the accident and knows the islanders blame him. ``If they want to kill, kill me, but I need a little peace,'' he said. Efforts to reach Arevalo for more comment were unsuccessful Wednesday. The arrests come eight days after the Jessica ran aground off San Cristobal Island, one of the Galapagos chain. Over the days that followed, the ship leaked at least 185,000 gallons of diesel fuel into this fragile ecosystem, one populated by species found nowhere else in the world and an inspiration for Charles Darwin's theory of evolution. Only one pelican and two seagulls are known to have died. But dozens of other birds and marine animals _ sea lions, seagulls, blue-footed boobies and albatrosses _ also have been affected, officials at the Galapagos' sprawling wildlife park said. And while scientists here say the spill could have been much worse, the long-term environmental damage to the islands 600 miles off the mainland remains unclear. ``We are trying at all costs to prevent the fuel from reaching land,'' said biologist Harry Reyes, who helped set up a perimeter of buoys around the spill. One environmental workers said Wednesday that the spill was under control. ``We were very worried at first, but what has happened is not so grave,'' Carlos Valle, the Galapagos coordinator for the World Wildlife Fund, told The Associated Press. Treading carefully over fuel-slicked rocks on Wednesday, park ranger Navil Segovia approached one pelican, sluggish and stained black with diesel fuel. He netted the bird, then carefully embraced it around its chest, its wings folded in. The pelican was then loaded onto a vehicle and taken to a control center, where it will be cleaned before being released. ``It wasn't difficult to catch because it was dazed,'' Segovia said. About 200 volunteers, park rangers and environmental experts searched for affected wildlife along the shores of San Cristobal and Santa Fe Island, 37 miles to the west, home to large colonies of sea lions and marine iguanas. Four sea lion cubs were cleaned and released Wednesday, said park director Eliecer Cruz. Some conservationists fear the fuel will sink to the ocean floor, destroying algae vital to the food chain and threatening marine iguanas, sharks, birds that feed off fish and other species. Conservationists worldwide demanded that Ecuador take greater steps to protect the Galapagos. And Rendon said the country is doing so: He said new legislation is being written to require special permission and insurance for all vessels entering the Galapagos with more than 10 gallons of fuel aboard. Shipping authorities have confirmed that the Jessica was not insured for environmental contamination, he said. International shipping rules require such insurance for vessels carrying 2,000 tons of fuel, while the Jessica had only 300 tons aboard, Galapagos park officials said. ``We are writing up the regulations to establish what fuels can enter the Galapagos, and moreover, that the minimum amount possible is used,'' Rendon said. The 28-year-old tanker Jessica is owned by the Ecuadorean company Acotramar. It regularly transported diesel and bunker, a heavy fuel used by tour boats, from the mainland into the Galapagos, Ecuador's main tourist attraction. It was carrying a cargo of some 234,000 gallons of fuel when it hit bottom 550 yards off San Cristobal, the easternmost island in the archipelago. Thousands of gallons were safely removed from the tanker after it hit, but much more spilled into the water. Authorities had suspended oil recovery operations and were waiting out rough tides when the last of the ship's cargo _ an estimated 15,000 to 20,000 gallons of fuel _ spilled out late Tuesday, apparently after pounding surf tore new ruptures in the hull.

The Captain of the stricken tanker off the Galapagos Islands has had a nervous breakdown. He was due to face the press after hearing that he was being prosecuted by the Ecuadorian authorities after 250,000 gallons of oil were spilled into the sea near the Islands. Tim Hersche reports. Captain Tokinio Arivalo has already admitted that his navigational mistake steering the Jessica into harbor on the island of San Kristobal caused the spill, which has threatened the unique wild life of the Galapagos. He was due to face the world press at a news conference, but shortly before he was said to have suffered a nervous collapse and he is now being treated at a Naval Hospital on the island. Meanwhile, two tugboats are in the harbor attempting to attach cables to the stricken vessel so that she can be pulled upright and prepared for floating off the rocks. A United States coast guard spokesman has said it's an operation which could take several days. Tim Hersche, BBC News on the Galapagos Islands.

As he ambles down the street with a newspaper under his arm, the clean-shaven engineer, dressed in a neat down jacket and blue slacks, could be an advertisement for the new urban China. He has a Ph.D., speaks a bit of English, likes to surf the Net and has moved steadily up in his profession. He could be, that is, except for one thing: He remains a committed though mostly closeted _ practitioner of the banned spiritual movement, Falun Gong. And that represents a challenge to the Chinese government, whose vicious 18-month campaign has failed to eliminate the group, in large part because it has been unable to quash, or even reliably identify the millions of quietly committed followers who make the group so resilient. Brazen expressions of dissent are mounting; just on Tuesday, five Falun Gong members set themselves ablaze in the middle of Tiananmen Square, and one died, a terrifying denouement to months of almost daily smaller acts of civil disobedience by group members. By now, the police are adept at snatching banners and whisking meditators into vans, instantaneously erasing all traces of trouble. The silent majority in Falun Gong do not demonstrate. Yet they form an enormous reservoir of believers who may someday be driven to act. They provide emotional and, sometimes, financial support to each other and to those members who have been jailed or lost jobs. ``Those who go to the Square are the tip of the iceberg or _ as we say in Chinese _ just one hair on nine oxen,'' said the engineer, who spoke on condition on anonymity. ``They are willing to confront whatever the government will do to them. Most of us are not.'' All this makes Falun Gong a daunting foe for China's ever-present security forces. ``Falun Gong may prove to be the most challenging organized opposition'' the party has faced, said Xiaobo Lu, a professor of political science at Barnard College, in New York. ``In this `political struggle,' I see an image of a giant fighting a ghost _ you know it is there and haunting you, but you don't exactly know where to attack, or when it will attack you.'' Falun Gong is so threatening to China's leadership precisely because it includes a remarkable cross section of people _ peasants and professors, rich and poor _ devoted to an organization that is not the Chinese Communist Party. No matter that the group has no political goals and, in China at least, is only loosely organized. But the government's attacks may backfire, people here say. So far, the attacks have helped radicalize and politicize people whose only goal 18 months ago was to improve their health though Falun Gong's quirky blend of exercise, meditation and mystical Eastern-leaning philosophy. ``The Chinese Communist Party has a damned-if-you-do, damned-if-you-don't dilemma,'' said Lu. ``Had there not been a crackdown, Falun Gong could have become a huge organized force that someday might be at odds with the government. ``But as the government tries to suppress the group, it has become a real opposition and more ``political'' than ever,'' he said. The China anti-Cult Association estimates that after the crackdown 50,000 to 80,000 Falun Gong members are still practicing in China. But adherents put the number in the tens of millions. On Tiananmen, the bulk of the demonstrators appear to be poor peasants and middle aged factory workers _ people often attracted to Falun Gong by its purported health benefits. But many in the Falun Gong are educated and well connected professionals drawn to the groups' mystical cosmology; while unseen forces like ``qi'' are ridiculed in the west, many Chinese accept their existence. ``My belief is not blind faith but the result of careful and deep reflection,'' the engineer said. ``Many people believe that a higher being exists, not just in China.'' Falun Gong adamantly denies that it is ``organized'' in any official sense. But the piecemeal efforts of its millions of Chinese members have at the very least created a nationwide web of like-minded people that effectively undercuts the government ban. The engineer, who is adept with computers, takes postings off the blocked Falun Gong web site and passes them on to friends, even mailing them to people in his distant home town. On January 1st, Falun Gong leader, Li Hongzhi, who lives in exile in New York, announced on his web site that followers need no longer practice ``forbearance'' in the face of unreasonable attacks. That message by now has made its way to rural China, perhaps provoking a recent spate of bold demonstrations. Almost everyone seems to know a member of the group _ a landlord, an office-mate, the owner of a favorite dumpling stand. And while many regard Falun Gong as quirky or strange, they do not approve of the persecution of colleagues and friends. ``I'm not a follower, but I sympathize with them,'' said a magazine editor. ``They're just people following their beliefs.'' The government's heavy handed campaign _ complete with calls to denounce colleagues, cult-bashing comic books and reformed practitioners trotted out on TV _ seems better suited to the isolated China of 1960 than to the relatively open, sophisticated country of today. The Chinese now get news from the Internet, from Hong Kong television and from an increasingly diverse state press. They travel freely inside China and are in constant touch with friends in other parts of the country. Many are at least somewhat disillusioned with the Communist Party, and most are skeptical of propaganda. The engineer said he became disillusioned with Communism after the June 4, 1989, Army crackdown on pro-democracy protesters in Tiananmen Square, which left hundreds dead. He said the experience led him to abandon the ``materialist'' world view promoted by the Communist Party and to search for a new ideal. ``Ten or twenty years ago, it's hard to imagine the movement could have persisted in China after 18 months of a government campaign,'' he said. ``But people understand persecution. They can sympathize and identify with us, because of events like the Cultural Revolution and June 4th.'' Although the Chinese government has called on all citizens and work units to weed out Falun Gong members, the call has been answered with varying degrees of enthusiasm. The leaders of Qinghua University, China's equivalent of M.I.T., have been zealous in ferreting out on-campus followers, but at Beijing University, the country's number one university, officials have adopted more of a ``don't ask, don't tell'' policy, one student said. One teacher was removed from his job after he protested in Tiananmen Square, but continues to get housing and pay from his school. Also, more and more Chinese now work for themselves and live in private housing, making their personal lives hard to monitor. But when they are found out, members and their families could lose their jobs, or be detained. Of the 20 adherents the engineer knew best before the government's 1999 ban, about half have been detained at least once, and two are in labor camps, he said. He himself was detained for a few weeks last year, after police broke into a home where he and others were doing exercises. In the detention center, he said, food, generally cabbage and bread, was inadequate, and he was forced to sit still on a wooden plank for as much a 7 hours a day. Falun Gong members have described many incidents of torture in captivity, and claim that more than 100 members have died in jail. The engineer said he was hit only once _ the one time he tried to meditate. Since his release, he said, the police have frequently visited and harassed him, checking on him several times a day on important holidays, when Falun Gong demonstrations are more numerous. But even the police have shown an uncertain resolve. ``At first, they wanted me to promise that I wouldn't practice,'' he said. ``But in the end I just promised that I'd practice at home and they were OK with that. They said, `that way we won't see it and Jiang Zemin won't know'.'' Still, since ``truth'' is one of the cardinal principles of Falun Gong, he is somewhat ashamed of that arrangement. The largely poor demonstrators who show up at Tiananmen have obviously been unwilling to live with compromise. Peasants from small towns may be unable to hide their practice from zealous authorities. And the followers who have already lost their jobs or homes may have little left to hide.

When a big donor called in November seeking a letter acknowledging his largesse, Jonathan Halevy, the head of Shaare Zedek Medical Center in Jerusalem, did what he always does. He obliged. But Halevy was never told, he said on Thursday, that his brief testimonial would be one of 52 such letters used to help persuade President Clinton to pardon Marc Rich as one of his last acts in office. And now, he said, he feels misled. ``I'm obliged, if I got a donation from someone, to confirm that I got it in writing,'' Halevy said Thursday night from his home. ``But I think it would be very fair to tell me this was the purpose.'' Halevy said Avner Azulay, the head of the Rich Foundation in Tel Aviv, called about two months ago and asked him to acknowledge the foundation's gifts. The stated reason, Halevy said, was that the foundation was preparing a ``book in honor of Rich and the foundation.'' As the head of one of Israel's most important charities, Halevy said, he gets such requests often, thought nothing of it, and dispatched a letter, dated Nov. 30. Several other people whose letters were in the petition put before the president on Dec. 11 said they, too, knew nothing about the quiet but furious efforts made to obtain a pardon for Rich, a financier who has lived abroad for 17 years rather than face trial in the United States for tax fraud and other crimes. Criticism to the pardon has poured in from many corners, partly because Rich's former wife, Denise, is a close friend of Clinton and partly because the application was sent directly to the White House by Jack Quinn, a former White House counsel who works for Rich, bypassing the normal channels through the Justice Department. Denise Rich and Quinn made personal appeals to Clinton to grant the pardon before prosecutors were aware that a pardon of a noted fugitive was being considered. Quinn, who has been widely criticized for using his government connections to win a long-shot pardon, refused to say on Thursday how much he would be paid, insisting that it was within his normal rates. ``The fee figures of $5 million to $10 million are absolutely and unequivocally false,'' he said through a spokesman, referring to figures being repeated by other lawyers. On Thursday, The Associated Press reported, Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., the chairman of the House Government Reform Committee, requested documents about the pardon from a wide range of sources in what could be the first of many such salvos. Azulay, the foundation executive who collected many of the letters that were sent from prominent Israeli citizens about Rich's charitable activities, would not comment on Thursday. Reached at his home, he said: ``I can't hear you. Please call back.'' He then hung up. His phone registered repeated busy signals for the rest of the evening. All 52 letters were described by the petition as ``Letters Expressing Support for the Pardon of Marc Rich.'' Yet Robert F. Fink, one of Rich's lawyers, acknowledged, ``Not everyone was necessarily told it was going to be for a pardon.'' Indeed, only one of six letter writers reached on Thursday night said he knew the letter might by used in connection with Rich's legal problems. Teddy Kollek, a former mayor of Jerusalem who now works for the Jerusalem Foundation, wrote a letter as well. Kollek, too, said he knew nothing about a pardon. Not that he was miffed. ``I have no complaint against it,'' he said. ``He does a lot of charity in this country.'' ``I go by what he does here, and what he does here is totally positive.'' Noting that he was nearing 90, Kollek was a bit frustrated that he could not remember exactly who had asked him to provide the testimonial. ``I can't remember,'' he said. ``But I don't think I ever wrote to President Clinton about a reprieve or about his sentence. This is not my business.'' His lone complaint was that Rich was ``supposed to be a very rich man'' and that his gifts to the Jerusalem Foundation were ``comparatively small.'' ``He could probably do much more,'' Kollek said. Gila Almagor, an Israeli actress who is on the Tel Aviv City Council, said she not only knew nothing about a possible pardon, she also knew little about Rich's legal woes. ``I never met Rich, never.'' Nonetheless, Almagor wrote an appreciative letter in 1999 thanking Rich for being such an enthusiastic supporter of the local arts. The Rich Foundation had her letter on file and forwarded it as well. ``I didn't know about any petition, but I'm glad President Clinton pardoned him,'' she said. If her letter ``helped Rich, why not?'' she asked. ``In one part of the world someone is a saint, and in other part of the world he is what he is.''

Venus and Serena Williams completed a career Grand Slam in women's doubles Friday, beating Lindsay Davenport and Corina Morariu 6-2, 2-6, 6-4 in the Australian Open. The Williams sisters won the French Open and U.S. Open in 1999. Last year they won Wimbledon and gold medals in the Sydney Olympics. The title was a nice consolation prize for the sisters, both eliminated in singles by Martina Hingis. Serena was defeated in the quarterfinals and Venus endured the most lopsided loss of her career, 6-1, 6-1, in the semifinals Thursday. The Grand Slam title was the eighth for Venus and the seventh for Serena, including two in mixed doubles for each player. Their 22-match winning streak in women's doubles was snapped in a first-round loss at Sydney earlier this month to Hingis and Monica Seles. The Williamses avenged that defeat Thursday in the semifinals. The sisters jumped to a 3-0 lead in the final, breaking Davenport's serve in the second game. Davenport lost her serve twice more in the final set, including the last game. For their latest title, the sisters won $196,878. They were unseeded because they played together in only three tournaments last year. Davenport and Morariu received $98,440.

The Williams sisters won the French Open and U.S. Open in 1999. Last year they won Wimbledon and gold medals in the Sydney Olympics. ``We love to play with each other,'' Venus said. ``I can't imagine playing with anyone else. We do so well together.'' The title came after both sisters were eliminated in singles by Martina Hingis. Serena was defeated in the quarterfinals and Venus endured the most lopsided loss of her career, 6-1, 6-1, in the semifinals Thursday. ``This is no consolation, because we're really singles players,'' Serena said. ``This is just a different event.'' The Grand Slam title was the eighth for Venus and the seventh for Serena, including two in mixed doubles for each player. Their 22-match winning streak in women's doubles was snapped in a first-round loss at Sydney earlier this month to Hingis and Monica Seles. The Williamses avenged that defeat Thursday in the semifinals. The sisters jumped to a 3-0 lead in the final, breaking Davenport's serve in the second game. Davenport lost her serve twice more in the final set, including the last game. For their latest title, the sisters won $196,878. They were unseeded because they played together in only three tournaments last year. Davenport and Morariu received $98,440.

Joseph Kabila, the young and little-known son of Laurent Kabila, was sworn in as president of this war-divided Central African nation on Friday, 10 days after his father's assassination. Government and military officials, traditional leaders and other dignitaries looked on at Congo's former parliament building as Joseph Kabila pledged to unite and defend a country that has been ravaged by corrupt leadership and 2 1/2 years of civil war. ``I solemnly commit to respect the constitution and the laws of the republic, to guarantee the independence, unity and the cohesion of the Congolese people, as well as the integrity of the national territory,'' Kabila said in French, as he stood in a dark pinstriped suit near a 10-foot-high portrait of his father. The Supreme Court confirmed the younger Kabila as the fourth president since independence from Belgium in 1960 amid heavy security at the Palace of the Nation _ the same hall where Laurent Kabila's body was laid to rest Tuesday inside a marble mausoleum. Court President Lwonge Kabinda Ngoy said Kabila was born in 1971 to Laurent Kabila and a Congolese mother, deflecting the popular belief that the new president's mother is a Tutsi, the dominant ethnic group in Congo's hated neighbor, Rwanda. Earlier, it was reported he was born in 1972. Joseph Kabila was expected to address the nation Friday evening for the first time. Raised in Tanzania and Uganda, he remains a mystery to most people in Congo. ``We have never heard him speak. We want to hear his program,'' said Robert Disashi, a traditional leader in a dark blue suit and leopard tooth necklace, as he arrived for the ceremony. ``We aspire for nothing but peace.'' Laurent Kabila's inner circle was quick to fill the power vacuum after the former president was gunned down by one of his own bodyguards, but has since fretted over legal details of succession in the troubled country that has never enjoyed a peaceful transfer of power. Initially scheduled for Wednesday, the inauguration was delayed once to allow the slain Kabila's hand-picked parliament to approve his son's ascension, and once again to give the Supreme Court time to craft the oath of office. Laurent Kabila suspended the country's constitution when he toppled the late Mobutu Sese Seko in 1997, leaving no blueprint for a handover of power. The selection of the young Joseph Kabila was met with widespread fears that a figurehead had been chosen, leaving little hope for an end to the civil war and a revival of the shattered economy. But some foreign officials view the death of Laurent Kabila, who continued Mobutu's corrupt and self-serving policies, as a sudden opportunity for peace. Louis Michel, foreign minister of former colonial ruler Belgium, launched a tour of the region after Kabila's funeral, urging Congo's warring parties to seize the moment and enter a dialogue to end the war. After meeting Rwandan President Paul Kagame in Kigali on Thursday, Michel called the sudden power transfer ``a new element, which can justify a new space to discuss ... peace.'' Joseph Kabila told U.N. special representative Kamel Morjaneon on Thursday he is open to new peace talks and eventual democratic elections in Congo. But he added ``this will not be possible as long as foreign troops occupied part of his territory,'' U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said at the world body's headquarters in New York. Congo's civil war began in August 1998 when Laurent Kabila's main sponsors, Uganda and Rwanda, turned against him and began supporting an anti-government rebellion. He held onto power and kept the rebels at bay with the help of new allies Angola, Zimbabwe and Namibia, who have pledged to keep their forces in Congo to defend Kabila's son.

The most powerful earthquake to strike India in more than half a century rocked the subcontinent on Friday, killing more than 650 people as it toppled buildings and houses in India and Pakistan. The 7.9 magnitude temblor in western Gujarat state, close to the border with Pakistan, shook high-rise buildings hundreds of miles away in the capital, New Delhi, and was even felt in Nepal and Bangladesh. All the deaths in India were recorded in Gujarat state. In Ahmedabad, Gujarat's commercial capital and a city of 4.5 million, as many as 50 multistory buildings collapsed and at least 200 people were killed. Hundreds of people besieged the fire station asking for help to dig out their relatives, said fire chief Rajesh Bhat. ``This is an emergency. We are facing a riotous crowd,'' Bhat said. ``A fear psychosis is developing in the city. People have fled their homes and are taking refuge in open fields.'' Corpses were piled up on the verandah of the N.S. Hospital, while patients overflowing into the hallways wailed and screamed with broken limbs and bleeding wounds. Press Trust of India reported 70 people died while waiting to be treated. The overall death toll in India was 651 and expected to climb, Cabinet minister Pramod Mahajan said during a break in an emergency meeting held by Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee. Two children died in southern Pakistan when their house collapsed, bringing the toll to 653. The epicenter was near Bhuj, a desert town of 150,000 people in Gujarat. Ninety percent of the houses in Bhuj were damaged, Mahajan said. Police said 150 people in the town had been killed. Mahajan, the Cabinet minister, said power supply had been affected but there was no damage to the two 220-megawatt nuclear plants in the state. The quake struck as many cities were celebrating India's 51st Republic Day, which commemorates the adoption of the constitution. The quake caused high-rise buildings to sway from New Delhi in the north, to Bombay and Madras in the south and Calcutta in the west, many hundreds of miles from the epicenter. Reports of aftershocks came in from around the country. An apparent aftershock hit Bangladesh, where hundreds of panicked residents flooded into the streets of Satkhira, on the border with India. In Ahmedabad, a center of India's textile industry, about 70 children and some teachers were feared dead in the debris of their school building, while 19 engineering students were believed trapped in a collapsed college elsewhere in the city. Baijubahi, an Ahmedabad man who uses only one name, said his wife was killed in the earthquake and six members of his family were still trapped in their building. ``The police are trying to persuade me to go to the hospital for my wife's post-mortem,'' he said. ``I'm more concerned about the rest, who could have survived.'' Gujarat state's home minister, Haren Pandya, said 100 buildings had collapsed throughout the province. ``The whole state has been affected. Communications have been disrupted all over the state,'' Pandya said. In the town of Surat _ where police reported at least 31 dead _ three people were killed in a stampede at a diamond factory. When the quake hit, diamond workers in the three-story factory crowded into a narrow stairwell and tried to push their way to the only exit, said police official Vineet Gupta. In most of the country, there was no damage or injuries. But there was panic in the crowd in Pondicherry, on the southeastern coast, watching a Republic Day parade. People fled from the parade, but were quickly calmed by loudspeaker announcements. In New Delhi, bleachers set up for the Republic Day parade swayed just before Vajpayee and other dignitaries arrived for the three-hour military display. Millions of Hindus at the world's largest religious gathering in Allahabad, in Uttar Pradesh, more than 1,000 miles east of the epicenter, felt the ground sway under them. No injuries were reported. In India's financial capital, Bombay, people rushed onto the streets and held onto doorways as the high-rise skyscrapers swayed. On June 16, 1819, another quake in western India killed between 1,500 and 2,000 people.

Arizona state lawmaker Chris Cummiskey was surprised at the speed with which President Bush brought up issues like abortion and school vouchers after his inaugural message on healing the country. New Hampshire political organizer Kathy Sullivan said she's been hearing from people surprised by the ``in your face'' quality of Bush's first days in office. San Diego administrative assistant Kathleen Kenneally said Bush's first efforts to roll back abortion rights happened ``way too quickly.'' Around the country, Democrats say they were taken aback by how rapidly the president staked out his positions on several controversial _ and potentially divisive _ issues like abortion, school vouchers and a $1.6 trillion tax cut. The incredibly close election of 2000 highlighted sharp divisions in the country, which Bush pledged to heal both during his campaign and in his inaugural address. ``The things you don't lead with if you're trying to build a bipartisan coalition are Roe v. Wade and school vouchers, said Cummiskey. ``Some people are saying he didn't run like this, ran more middle of the road, slightly to the right,'' said Sullivan, state Democratic chair in New Hampshire. ``If they had read the stories and listened to him speak, they would have known what they were getting.'' Some of the surprise in Democratic circles may have more to do with Bush's campaign style than the content, something veteran Bush watcher Bruce Buchanan, a University of Texas political scientist, called being ``seduced by his charm.'' ``Bush got away with excessive abstraction,'' said Green Party presidential candidate Ralph Nader. ``Nobody ever said, 'What do you mean when you talk about compassionate conservatives? What does it mean when you say you want to favor taxpayers?''' Four in 10 Americans in several polls have consistently said Bush did not win the presidency legitimately _ and that group is made up largely of Democrats. In Washington, Bush has been engaged in a charm offensive to win over Democratic members of Congress, but state Democratic leaders and voters nationwide get their impressions largely from his actions and news reports. Bush's move Monday to bar U.S. funds to international family planning groups involved with abortion and his order to review the government's approval of the RU-486 abortion pill caught their attention more than any of his comments about uniting the country. Democrats eager to see a more conservative tilt in Washington welcomed Bush's steps. ``I feel President Bush is trying to recognize that there are a lot of people pleased and proud that he would do something to help control this scourge of abortion,'' said former Kentucky congressman Romano Mazzoli, a Democrat who doesn't always agree with his national party. ``I'm also pleased to see this kind of increased responsibility, increased accountability.'' President Clinton reversed course on the funding of international family planning groups soon after entering office. Former Presidents Reagan and Bush banned U.S. aid to international groups that use their own money to support abortion. Bush's rapid moves to stake out his positions pleased many conservatives, especially Republicans. ``I talk to mostly Republicans in my office,'' said Jack Wunsch, a lab technician from Wausau, Wis., and a political independent. ``They're very upbeat.'' Bush spokesman Ari Fleischer was asked at his press briefing Thursday whether Bush would pursue the exact policies he discussed in the campaign rather than proposing measures likely to pass Congress. ``He's going to continue in the course of meetings to listen to people, and when he hears good ideas there'll be some flexibility,'' Fleischer said. ``But for the most part, what you're going to see is what you heard.'' Veteran Democratic organizers like Charles Whitehead of Panama City, Fla., said they were surprised to see Bush move so quickly on abortion. ``It was a bit of a deviation from where I thought he would begin to build his bipartisanship,'' said the former Florida Democratic chairman. In Texas, Buchanan said Bush's bold start ``shows a lot of guts'' even if the ``full frontal assault'' seems at odds with his inaugural message. ``His vision of leadership is that you don't start with concessions, you start with bold assertions of what you want to do,'' Buchanan said. ``Then you let the interaction of the legislature and interest groups play out. In the end, you settle and claim victory.'' ___ EDITOR'S NOTE _ Will Lester covers polling and politics for The Associated Press.

Fear of fallout from the U.S. economic slowdown permeated the crisp mountain air Friday at the World Economic Forum, though many global business and government leaders remain confident they can ride out the storm. On the first full day of the six-day conference, newly elected Mexican president Vicente Fox captured the mood at this Alpine resort with a mix of bravado and concern. ``Mexico will be the next success story of our time!'' he said, though he conceded his country could be battered if exports to its northern neighbor dry up. ``But we are not going to stay sitting at our desk waiting to see what happens,'' Fox added. ``That's why we're here.'' On Thursday, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan warned that the U.S. economy's growth rate at present is ``probably very close to zero.'' The United States accounts for four-fifths of Mexico's total trade, largely due to NAFTA _ the North American Free Trade Agreement. Greenspan hinted that the Fed is ready to follow up its surprise Jan. 3 interest rate cut with another half-point reduction next week to help head off potential recession. Nobel laureate Robert A. Mundell, professor of economics at Columbia University, said Friday he believed that would be the right step, along with President Bush's proposed tax cuts. ``I'm not too worried or frantic'' about a major recession, Mundell said. European officials shrugged off predictions that the U.S. economic slowdown could cause a crisis in Europe. Some 85 percent of trade done by the 12 countries using the euro is with each other _ providing a good measure of insulation to troubles across the Atlantic, they noted. Job creation is ``impressive,'' and consumer demand strong, partly due to big tax cuts passed last year in Germany and France that are kicking in now. ``Europe is viewed as being the steady and growing element of the whole system,'' said French Finance Minister Laurent Fabius. Fox said he wants a trade agreement Mexico signed last year with the European Union to be as ``successful and fruitful,'' and is also working on a trade pact with South America's biggest countries. Not that U.S.-Mexican ties are becoming less important: U.S. President Bush's decision to make his first foreign trip since taking office to Mexico send an ``important message,'' Fox said, adding that he expects to get along with the former Texas governor. ``We both wear cowboy boots,'' Fox said. ``We both come from farming. We both believe in the future through hard work, discipline and teamwork.'' Boots could be useful in Davos on Saturday, and not just because of the 6 inches of freshly fallen snow. Police said they were considering spraying cow manure as a last resort to control any anti-globalization protesters who try to disrupt the summit. Authorities have banned demonstrations and set up identity checks on roads and rail lines leading to Europe's highest city. Swiss officials also took the highly unusual step of announcing a 10-hour shutdown Saturday of rail service to Davos and nearby Klosters, another ski town favored by Britain's Prince Charles and his sons. Protesters, who have managed to slip through blockades in past years, insist their Saturday march will go on to register their opposition to what they term ``globaloney.'' ___ On the Net: Forum official site: http://www.weforum.org Switzerland Independent Media Center: http://www.davos.indymedia.org HelloMr President: http://hellomrpresident.com Public Eye on Davos: http://www.davos2001.ch/

President Bush said Friday that federal money should not pay for research on fetal tissue or so-called stem cells derived from abortions. ``I do not support research from aborted fetuses,'' he said. He did not say whether he would move to block federal research funding _ an act that many scientists say could stop promising research into therapies for numerous diseases. Aides said afterward he was signaling his intent to do so. Bush had indicated his opposition to such research during the presidential campaign, but the remarks Friday were his first on the topic since taking over the White House a week ago. ``I will let you know when I decide all policy decisions, but the answer to your question is no,'' Bush said when asked whether he believes federal money should be spent on fetal-tissue and stem-cell research from abortions. On Monday, two days into his presidency, Bush had moved to restore restrictions on U.S. foreign aid to family-planning organizations involved in abortion. Anti-abortion conservatives were a cornerstone of his political campaign. Scientists say research with stem cells, master cells that are the building blocks for all other tissue in the body, could lead to revolutionary treatments for problems from Alzheimer's to paralyzing spinal cord injuries. Stem cells can come from aborted fetuses or from embryos left over from fertility clinics. A few also can be found from adult tissues, but scientists say fetal and embryonic stem cells are the most flexible and thus most usable. Bush did not specifically address embryonic stem cells. Some conservative groups oppose using embryonic stem cells for research because culling them kills the embryos. Scientists now know how to multiply embryonic stem cells in laboratories without killing additional embryos. Unless Bush intervenes, the National Institutes of Health plans to begin funding research with just those lab-grown embryonic stem cells as early as this spring. Some researchers are concerned that Bush might cut off existing funding for a larger type of research related to tissues from induced abortions. Some Parkinson's disease patients, for instance, improved after receiving fetal tissue transplants in their brains. Bush has said in the past he supports an alternative method using fetal tissues retrieved from miscarriages. But scientists say such tissue is seldom usable because of genetic abnormalities in the fetus that caused the miscarriage. ``I believe there's some wonderful opportunities for adult stem-cell research,'' Bush said. ``I believe we can find stem cells from fetuses that died a natural death, but I do not support research from aborted fetuses.'' He commented in a question-and-answer session during a meeting with Democratic and Republican governors. Shortly before Bush took office, his spokesman refused to address whether the new Republican administration would shut down government research on the stem cells of discarded human embryos. Press secretary Ari Fleischer, quoting his boss' statements during the campaign, said Friday that Bush ``would oppose federally funded research for experimentation on embryonic stem cells that require live human embryos to be discarded or destroyed.'' But Fleischer, questioned by reporters, would not say whether Bush intends to block the NIH, which is now accepting grant applications for research on lab-grown embryonic stem cells initially harvested by private researchers. Bush stopped short Friday of saying whether or how he might block the NIH funding. Incoming Health and Human Services Secretary Tommy Thompson has likewise sidestepped the issue. But as an anti-abortion governor of Wisconsin, Thompson praised as medical pioneers the University of Wisconsin scientists who first grew embryonic stem cells in their laboratory. The White House is reviewing all rules and executive orders implemented by the Clinton administration, including those on abortion-related research.

West Virginia's Democratic governor, who as a member of Congress looked into the activities of fugitive financier Marc Rich, criticized President Clinton's term-ending pardon of Rich as ``an awful message'' to send to the public. ``This is terrible, and I totally disagree with the president's actions,'' Bob Wise said in an interview Friday. Wise conducted congressional hearings in 1991-92 into the award to a Rich-connected company of $45 million in contracts with the U.S. Mint while Rich was a fugitive living in Switzerland. He was wanted on federal tax fraud charges filed in New York. Clinton's grant of clemency to Rich last Saturday ``says if you hang out long enough, you might be able to get a presidential pardon,'' Wise said from Charleston, W.Va. ``This isn't a person that ought to be pardoned, and it sends an awful message,'' the governor concluded. As a House subcommittee chairman nine years ago, Wise told a congressional hearing that ``Rich, himself, is still on the lam, still known as one of the greatest tax evaders in U.S. history, and yes, still living the good life.'' While still a congressman, Wise was elected West Virginia governor in November and took office Jan. 15. A former labor lawyer, he was first elected to Congress in 1982 as a liberal Democrat and moved toward the political center during his lengthy congressional tenure. Clinton responded to the criticism from his home in Chappaqua, N.Y., on Friday, telling reporters that the American people would support the pardon ``if they take a look at the record.'' Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., chairman of the House Government Reform Committee, is looking into whether Clinton ``had an improper motive'' for pardoning Rich and business partner Pincus Green in the last few hours of the Clinton presidency. Burton said Friday night on CNN's ``Wolf Blitzer Reports'' that he plans to investigate the matter fully, obtaining ``subpoenas if necessary.'' Rich's lawyer, Mark Quinn, interviewed on the same program, said there wouldn't be any need. ``There doesn't need to be any threatening of subpoenas,'' Quinn said. ``We will cooperate fully and promptly with any inquiry. We are confident that the facts are on our side. This indictment was really and truly bogus.'' According to Federal Election Commission records, Rich's ex-wife, songwriter Denise Rich, gave $201,000 in political donations to the Democratic Party last year as lawyers for the fugitive financier pressed the U.S. government to drop the case. Rich's attorneys turned to Clinton when the Justice Department refused to negotiate. Clinton said the value of his gifts are comparable to the value of those received by former President George Bush, if the values are considered on an annual basis. ``Just look at the whole record, look at the facts,'' Clinton said. ___ Associated Press writer Randy Coleman in Charleston, W.Va., contributed to this report.

Jennifer Capriati's comeback is complete. Unfazed by the pressure of playing in her first Grand Slam final, Capriati upset top-seeded Martina Hingis 6-4, 6-3 on Saturday to win the Australian Open. It was the most captivating moment in a tumultuous career for Capriati, the former child prodigy who left the women's tour in the mid-1990s because of drug and personal problems. Capriati entered the tournament seeded 12th and might be the most improbable women's Grand Slam champion since the Open era began in 1968. She beat defending champion Lindsay Davenport and four-time champ Monica Seles en route to the final, then outplayed Hingis from the start. On a gorgeous, cloudless day, Capriati was as perfect as the weather at the start, and she raced to a 3-0 lead in just 12 minutes. She slugged boldly from the baseline but was accurate, too, playing 25 points before she hit a shot long. Capriati's newfound fitness was often evident. She repeatedly ran down Hingis' drop shots, including on the final point of the first set, when she raced forward and bunted a backhand winner into the corner. Capriati was a big underdog but the sympathetic favorite, and the center-court crowd was clearly on her side, with supportive fans shouting her name between points. Her father and coach, Stefano, watched from under a red, white and blue USA hat, grinning and shaking his fist when his daughter hit a winner. By the second set, Hingis' frustration was increasingly evident. In the second game, after barely ticking Capriati' serve, Hingis hurled her racket to the court in anger. Hingis double-faulted on break point to fall behind 3-2, and Capriati's serve _ her downfall in the past _ held up the rest of the way. When Capriati hit a backhand return winner on the first match point, she hopped up and down, grinned and cried with joy. She clasped her hands behind her head, thrust her fists in the air and trotted over to her father. He rubbed her right arm _ the one that had just delivered a Grand Slam title. The loss was especially bitter for Hingis, who was bidding for her sixth Grand Slam title but her first since winning the 1999 Australian Open. She fell to 33-2 at Melbourne Park and lost to Capriati for the first time in their six meetings. Capriati ranks with the most unlikely of champions. The only unseeded titleist in the Open era was Chris O'Neil, who won the Australian Open in 1978, when many top players skipped the tournament. The lowest seeded champion previously was Iva Majoli, who won the 1997 French Open when seeded ninth. Capriati will climb to seventh in next week's rankings, the first time she has been in the top 10 since Jan. 16, 1994, when she was ninth. For the first time since 1995, the tournament is awarding equal prize money to men and women. Capriati received $473,385, and Hingis got $236,693.

A cargo ship intended to dump Russia's Mir space station into the Pacific Ocean successfully docked with the orbiter Saturday, beginning the last chapter in the battered spaceship's 15-year history. The Progress M1-5 cargo ship, loaded with more than two tons of fuel, will fire its thrusters to send the 140-ton station hurtling through the Earth's atmosphere over South Pacific. Russian space officials set March 6 as a tentative date for discarding the station, but warned that it may change. The flawless automatic docking at 8:33 a.m. Moscow time was greeted with relief and applause at Mission Control. ``The docking went without a hitch,'' said Valery Lyndin, a spokesman for Mission Control in Korolyov, 12 miles north of Moscow. The U.S. space agency NASA would provide navigational help in bringing the space station to Earth, said Yuri Semyonov, chief of the Energia company that built and controlled Mir. ``NASA has naturally proposed help because it's a very unusual operation that concerns everyone,'' Semyonov said. ``We need to have all the information we can get to have a clear idea of what is going on in orbit.'' The Russian Foreign Ministry sought to calm fears that Mir might crash on land, issuing a statement Friday that said that debris would be aimed at an ocean area halfway between Australia and Chile. Officials said that chunks of Mir, some weighing up to 1,500 pounds, would survive the fiery re-entry and splash into the ocean half an hour after Mir enters the atmosphere. In 1978, a Soviet satellite crashed in northern Canada, scattering radioactive fragments over the wilderness but causing no injuries. A year later, the unoccupied U.S. Skylab space station fell to Earth, spreading debris over western Australia. No one was hurt. Mir's orbit has gradually dropped from 215 miles above the Earth in the end of December to about 185 miles. It is expected to come down to 150 miles before the Progress fires its thrusters several times to push the Mir to the Earth. At the time of its launch on Feb. 20, 1986, Mir was on the cutting edge of space research. It has far outlived its original three- to five-year lifespan, hosting dozens of cosmonauts and foreign astronauts and providing unique know-how on long-term space flight. As it aged, the station was plagued by accidents _ from a fire and a near-fatal collision with a cargo ship in 1997 to computer breakdowns and other equipment failures. After much hesitation, the Russian government decided in December that Mir must be dumped because it is no longer safe and is too expensive to fix. The decision has angered many cosmonauts, space officials and politicians, who deplored the loss of the last remaining symbol of Soviet space glory. NASA has urged Russia to discard Mir and concentrate its scarce resources on the new international space station, a U.S.-led project that was delayed two years because of Russia's failure to provide a key segment.

Swiss authorities tightened road blocks, shut down a rail line and considered spraying cow manure on protesters to thwart demonstrations at an economic forum high in the Alps on Saturday. While police said the cow manure would be a last resort, they said they are serious about preventing unrest like at last year's meeting, when protesters broke a window at a McDonald's, vandalized several cars and burned a U.S. flag. Rail service to Davos and nearby Klosters, another ski town favored by Britain's Prince Charles, was being shut down for 10 hours to keep any last-minute stragglers away. Checks were set up on roads and rail lines days ago, with police turning suspected troublemakers away. While demonstrators outside protested what they termed ``globaloney,'' business and political leaders inside were to focus on steadying the global economy, with advice from the finance ministers of Germany, France and former U.S. Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers. A deputy director of the International Monetary Fund, Stanley Fischer, told conference participants that because of the recent slowdown in the U.S. economy the IMF was revising its prediction of last September that the global economy would grow 4.2 percent. The new prediction will be considerably lower, ``possibly in the range of 3.5 percent,'' said Fischer. But, he added, ``we are a long way from a global recession.'' Japanese Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori was to cover his country's woes separately, while Oprah Winfrey, Quincy Jones and AOL Time Warner president Richard Parsons were seeking to draw attention to a foundation to aid children. Colombian President Andres Pastrana canceled an appearance, though organizers were unsure of the reason. On the first full day of the six-day conference, Mexican President Vicente Fox captured the mood at this Alpine resort with a mix of bravado and concern. ``Mexico will be the next success story of our time!'' he said, while conceding that his country could be battered if exports to its northern neighbor dry up. ``But we are not going to stay sitting at our desk waiting to see what happens,'' he said. ``That's why we're here.'' The United States accounts for four-fifths of Mexico's total trade, largely due to the North American Free Trade Agreement. Fox said he wants a trade agreement Mexico signed last year with the European Union to be as ``successful and fruitful,'' and is also working on a trade pact with South America's biggest countries. Not that U.S.-Mexican ties are becoming less important. President Bush's decision to make his first foreign trip since taking office to Mexico sends an ``important message,'' Fox said, adding that he expects to get along with the former Texas governor. ``We both wear cowboy boots,'' Fox said. ``We both believe in the future through hard work, discipline and teamwork.'' European officials shrugged off predictions that the U.S. economic slowdown could cause a crisis in Europe. Some 85 percent of trade done by the 12 countries using the euro is with each other _ providing a good measure of insulation to troubles across the Atlantic, they noted. Job creation is ``impressive,'' and consumer demand is strong, partly due to big tax cuts passed last year in Germany and France. ``Europe is viewed as being the steady and growing element of the whole system,'' said French Finance Minister Laurent Fabius.

Survivors of a powerful earthquake that flattened cities in western India waited for food and tents as rescue workers searched frantically for signs of life under mountains of concrete rubble. Officials said 2,403 bodies had been recovered and the death toll was likely to exceed 7,400. Aid officials need up to 30,000 tents for those left homeless by the 7.9 magnitude quake, said Home Minister Haren Pandya of Gujarat state, which was devastated by Friday's quake. More than 100 multistory buildings and thousands of smaller houses collapsed like stacks of cards. The survivors desperately needed food and medical attention, Pandya said on television. The brunt of the temblor was borne by Bhuj, a town of 150,000 people 15 miles from the epicenter. The quake, the worst to hit India in more than 50 years, rocked Gujarat as people prepared to watch a live broadcast of Republic Day celebrations in India's capital, New Delhi. A high-ranking official at the state emergency control room said 1,450 of the 2,403 confirmed dead were in Bhuj. Another 10,000 people are believed to be buried in Bhuj under the mountains of jagged concrete rubble. At least 5,000 of those are most likely dead, he said on condition of anonymity. The quake also struck neighboring Pakistan, where 10 people were killed. Devastation was severe in Ahmedabad, Gujarat's biggest city and its commercial capital, where many high-rise buildings collapsed. In one building, a four-story elevator shaft remained intact while the apartments around it came down in a heap. Some 14,000 people, mostly suffering broken bones and cuts, jammed hospitals. Survivors sifted through the surface of the rubble Saturday, looking to salvage belongings or to hear sounds from still-buried loved ones. Rescue workers equipped with little more than crowbars or pickaxes dug through the debris. ``I am too distraught to talk, maybe later,'' said one man perched on a huge pile of stones as rescue workers searched for his 14-year-old daughter. ``Our first priority is to remove the survivors from the debris,'' Pandya said on New Delhi Television. ``The second is to inspect cracked buildings to see if they are safe for people to move back in.'' Some people crept up the twisted stairwells of destroyed buildings to pack valuables into suitcases and baskets, lowering them by rope to the ground. But people were too afraid to re-enter the buildings. They slept in the street around campfires with temperatures hovering around 55 degrees Fahrenheit. ``We slept a little in the open. We were too afraid to sleep inside,'' said businessman Ramesh Patel. Hetal Shah, 23, and her brothers were scrambling over a pile of stones and metal that used to be their fourth floor apartment at the top of a building. They were looking for $4,350 worth of jewelry and clothing that had been gathered for her wedding next month. Shah said she and her brothers had to push their ill father down the collapsing stairs of the house when the quake struck. ``Dad fell down on his chest and the house collapsed behind us,'' she said, her hair covered with dust and her eyes red. The main hospital in Bhuj, run by the air force, was crammed with the injured. Nearly 1,000 residents, most wrapped in blankets against the night chill, were camping outside the hospital waiting their turn, the Star television network reported. The government said it was flying 10,000 tents, 10,000 tons of grain, 20 doctors and surgeons, communications and seismology experts to Gujarat. ``The earthquake is a calamity of national magnitude,'' Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee said. ``We have decided to meet the emergency on a war footing. This is the time for people to rally around.'' The earthquake shook high-rise towers 600 miles away in the capital, New Delhi, and could be felt as far as 1,200 miles away in Calcutta and coastal Bangladesh _ a distance about equivalent to that between Washington and Dallas. Residents in the mountains of Nepal also felt the tremor. Vajpayee has made no appeal for international aid. President Bush, the United Nations, and Pakistan's army ruler Gen. Pervez Musharraf sent India condolences. Bush said the United States was willing to provide assistance if needed, and the United Nations said it would send a five-member earthquake assessment team to India on Sunday. The quake did no damage to the two 220-megawatt nuclear plants in Gujarat, authorities said. But gas pipelines, most power supply stations, phone lines and water service were knocked out across the arid state, which is prone to drought. It was the most powerful quake to strike India since Aug. 15, 1950, when an 8.5 magnitude temblor killed 1,538 people in northeastern Assam state. The U.S. Geological Survey, taking an average of seismograph measurements from around the world, said Friday's quake registered 7.9. There were at least 83 aftershocks, several measuring up to 5.6 in magnitude, in the 10 hours after the quake, said the seismological department at the Bhaba Atomic Center. An apparent aftershock also hit Bangladesh, where hundreds of panicked residents flooded into the streets of Satkhira, on the border with India.

To the players who wished her well in her comeback but possibly took her lightly, Jennifer Capriati had a reply: Shock them early and keep pounding winners. Capriati did it to defending champion Lindsay Davenport in the semifinal, jumping to a 3-0 lead on her way to the title showdown. Then she did it more emphatically against three-time winner Martina Hingis, racing to 4-0 in 12 minutes and winning the Australian Open title 6-4, 6-3 on Saturday. On her first match point, after 63 minutes of play, she slammed a backhand serve return. ``It was a winner down the line,'' she said, ``but it was just the slowest winner. It just kept going. ``As soon as I saw that it was clean, I had done it, the reality just hit me. 'Oh my God.' I just jumped for joy. I couldn't believe it just really happened.'' It was the 24-year-old Capriati's first Grand Slam tournament championship, and came five years after she began a comeback in earnest from the setbacks of drug and personal problems. In her early playing years, she never went beyond the semifinals at a Grand Slam event, although she won the Olympic gold medal as a 16-year-old in 1992, beating Steffi Graf in the final. ``That seems like another life,'' she said. ``This is a new life, a different life.'' Capriati was past considering her progress a comeback as she moved up the rankings in recent years. Although she went from Wimbledon 1993 to Wimbledon 1998 without winning any match in a Grand Slam, she reached her first Grand Slam semifinal in nine years at last year's Australian Open, losing to eventual winner Davenport. Still, as the No. 12 seed, she was a longshot this time. The only unseeded champ in the Open era was Chris O'Neil, who won the Australian Open in 1978, when many top players skipped the tournament. Iva Majoli, who won the 1997 French Open, previously was the lowest-seeded champion at ninth. ``Maybe they're taking me lightly,'' Capriati said of her last two matches here. Hingis, ranked No. 1 on the tour, had won all five of their previous matches. Davenport, No. 2, was 5-1 against her before their semifinal. The key was to ``start real well and jump on top of my opponents,'' Capriati said. She broke Hingis in the first game, winning the last three points with a running forehand down the line, a backhand down the line, and a quick recovery that led to an eventual miss by Hingis. The 20-year-old Hingis, who has lost only two of her last 35 matches at the Australian Open, threw and kicked her racket after a service winner by Capriati in the second set's second game. Even after beating both sisters for the first time in a single tournament _ Serena in the quarterfinals and Venus in the semifinals _ Hingis knew she still had a tough task at hand. ``I knew I had to face a great player out there, otherwise she wouldn't have beaten Monica (Seles) and Lindsay here,'' Hingis said. After beating Venus 6-1, 6-1 Thursday, she and Seles lost to the eventual champion Williams sisters in the doubles semifinals. ``I was dead after that,'' Hingis said. ``Just mentally, I didn't have it any more to go out there again and fight for every point.'' Hingis has not added to her collection of five Grand Slam titles since winning the 1999 Australian. ``I think there are worse disasters in life than what happened to me today,'' Hingis said. ``I can still smile. I'm healthy. I have more opportunities to come.'' Hingis fought back from 1-5 to 4-5 before Capriati served out the first set, sprinting all out on set point to return a drop shot and stopping just short of illegally touching the net. Capriati gained her key break in the second, for 3-2, on four quick points. She hit three forehand winners, and then watched Hingis double-fault. During Hingis' first-set resurgence, Capriati said she tried not to think about letting the set slip away. ``She started to play a little bit different. She tried to start hitting the ball deeper, maybe a little bit higher, with more spin,'' Capriati said. ``But she couldn't hit them all deep.'' During her victory speech, Capriati reflected on how she rebounded from her past troubles ``Who would've thought I would have ever made it here after so much has happened?'' Capriati told the supportive center-court crowd. ``Dreams do come true if you keep believing in yourself. Anything can happen.'' Asked later how she might respond to a Hollywood offer for her life story, she said, ``If I were to do something like that, I would never sell it for anything. I don't know. For now, no. Who knows down the road in the future, but of course only on my terms.'' After the handshake with Hingis at the net, Capriati thrust her hands in the air and trotted over to her father and coach, Stefano. Reaching down from the stands, he blew a kiss and rubbed her right arm. Then she went back to her changeover chair and phoned her brother back home in Florida. ``I'm proud of her all the time, but especially now,'' said her beaming father. Capriati will climb to seventh in next week's rankings, the first time she has been in the top 10 since Jan. 16, 1994, when she was ninth. For the first time since 1995, the tournament is awarding equal prize money to men and women. Capriati received $473,385, and Hingis got $236,693.

On Jan. 22, 1993, his third day as president, Bill Clinton laid down his marker on abortion. He revoked a rule adopted in the Reagan administration that prohibited doctors and nurses in federal family planning programs from counseling women about abortion. Last Monday, on his third day in office, President George W. Bush responded in kind. He signed an order overturning the Clinton administration's policy of giving federal aid to overseas family planning groups that offer abortion counseling. The big issues before the new administration like tax cuts, Medicare, missile defense and education could take months, perhaps even years, to resolve. But presidents can change some policies, like those on abortion counseling, just by signing executive orders, and they can change others by instructing the departments and agencies under them to issue new rules and regulations. With that in mind, land developers, manufacturers, abortion opponents and conservatives opposed to affirmative action and gay rights are leaning on the Bush administration to move quickly to overturn policies put in place under Clinton. ``Many conservatives,'' said Grover Norquist, a leading conservative strategist, ``believe we need to steam-clean the White House to get rid of everything Clinton did. If there's something that's good, we can put it back, but we ought to throw all his laundry out on the lawn.'' That may be easier said than done. Executive orders require just the stroke of a pen. Bush could, for example, sign an order overturning the Clinton directive prohibiting discrimination against homosexuals in federal employment and security clearances. But once a department or agency approves a regulation, it has the force of law, and can be changed only through tedious bureaucratic procedures. That is why the Clinton administration worked overtime to lock in place a range of rules the Republicans find objectionable. Jay Cochran III, who analyzes government regulations as a fellow at the Mercatus Center, a research institute at George Mason University, found that all recent administrations had rushed regulations onto the books in their final hours in power. He calls it the ``Cinderella constraint.'' But he found that none had done it as aggressively as the Clinton administration. Here are some of the most important rules, called midnight regulations, adopted in the final days of the Clinton presidency: _ The Labor Department approved new rules on workplace safety that would require millions of offices and factories to be redesigned and could cost American businesses, corporate groups say, more than $100 billion. _ The National Forest Service issued rules that would protect 60 million acres from roads and logging. _ The Environmental Protection Agency issued more stringent standards on arsenic in drinking water, pollution by big trucks and buses and runoff from animal feeding operations. _ The Agriculture Department imposed stricter meat inspection tests for plants that make hot dogs and other processed meats and cheeses. _ The Energy Department approved a rule to increase the efficiency of residential central air-conditioners and heat pumps. _ The Health and Human Services Department issued hundreds of pages of guidelines for managed care programs under Medicare. On the last morning of his presidency, Clinton granted pardons or clemency to more than 150 people and signed orders designating two historic forts on Governors Island in New York Harbor as national monuments. The pardon and clemency grants cannot be reversed, and the monument designations can be overturned only by an act of Congress. But the midnight regulations are somewhat less solidly set in stone. Shortly after Bush was sworn in, his chief of staff, Andrew H. Card Jr., instructed all departments and agencies not to implement any of the recently published regulations until the new administration reviewed them. The Reagan and Clinton administrations took similar steps during their first days. But the only way the agencies can overturn the new rules permanently is to start from scratch and prepare new regulations, a long process. Even then, the Supreme Court has ruled, regulations cannot be reversed in a way that is ``arbitrary'' or ``capricious.'' Under a 1996 law, Congress can also step in and pass a resolution of disapproval. The law has never been tested, because Clinton would have been sure to veto any attempt to countermand one of his own administration's rules. But Congress is likely to try this spring to block the new workplace safety regulations, and if such a resolution is approved, Bush will doubtless sign it. There are other, less formal ways a new administration can change policy. The Justice Department could settle the suit against Microsoft the way the Reagan administration dropped antitrust action against IBM begun under Lyndon B. Johnson. Or the administration could simply not enforce rules it disagrees with. The Clinton administration, for example, basically disregarded an executive order signed by Reagan that required agencies to ``review their actions carefully to prevent unnecessary takings'' of private property. Perhaps most important, the president can throw his weight around. In the last six years of his presidency, according to the Natural Resources Defense Council, Clinton used a veto threat to block more than 70 riders attached to budget bills that would have relaxed rules in areas like forest and wildlife protection, mining on public lands, air and water pollution, food safety and wetlands preservation. Many of these measures, it is safe to say, stand a good chance of now becoming law.

I love that Bill Clinton wants to emulate Jimmy Carter and work in the field of conflict resolution. Talk about the fox in the henhouse. Not since the troublemaking goddess Eris threw the apple of discord into an Olympian banquet has anyone been able to create as much conflict as fast as our Bill. Eris had only one apple. Bill has orchards. Whenever things get peaceful, whenever Clinton seems to have gotten his act together, he goes apple-picking again. Despite the self-inflicted chaos and soap-operatic strife of the last eight years, the country was feeling pretty good about the Clintons as their last day here dawned. The vapid election and vituperative unelection had fostered some Clinton nostalgia. He was a hard worker who did some good things. His heart was in the right place, even if his libido wasn't. He was a diverting rogue, astonishing tactician and miraculous escape artist. You had to give him that. Many also forgave Hillary's sins with commodities trading, Travelgate, health care and stonewalling. Her dutiful Senate campaign persuaded them that she should have a chance to perform _ and be judged _ on her own. She had been a senator for all of two and a half seconds when the buzz about a potential presidency commenced. Then we saw the Saturday Morning Mess Occur. Now it will be hard to separate Bonnie from Clyde. It was a graceless, grabby, gabby exit _ crooks in striped outfits sprinting through the breached wall, Clintonites vandalizing the People's House and prying W's from computer keyboards, and the Clintons' merry laughter echoing. That creeping Clinton nostalgia curdled into creepiness. Bill and Hill took enough loot to fill a small hotel and liberated enough criminals to populate a new Australia. Only Bill Clinton could provoke a round of Dan Burton abuse-of-power hearings after he'd left office. Only Hillary Clinton, in her first days as a senator, could engender a debate about whether the Senate should tighten up the gift ban. Hillary is telling people how relieved she is to put the last eight years behind her. Maybe she regarded this final spree _ including her gazillion-dollar book deal and her bulging hope chest of parting gifts from Democratic contributors _ as the final chapter of her old life, rather than the tawdry, disappointing first chapter of her new life. The Clintons always want one more pass, one more Mulligan. Even after they hawked seats on Air Force One, nights in the Lincoln Bedroom, state dinners, pricey coffee and their friendship, they still enjoyed the benefit of the doubt. Small wonder, then, that they expected Americans to stomach a White House fire sale of presidential pardons and senatorial influence. On his last all-nighter in the White House, Bill was clearly feeling way too empathetic toward Marc Rich and others who were hounded by prosecutors for years. In a delicious symmetry, the Clintons were bookended by Bushes; both families have a distinctive sense of entitlement. The Bushes think they're good people and therefore entitled. The Clintons think they do good works and are therefore entitled. When Bill and Hillary omnivorously trade political favors for personal ones, they don't realize this defines them as much as a policy act. In David Maraniss' biography of Bill Clinton, he writes of Hillary wanting to build a pool at the Arkansas mansion. Dick Morris explained to her that she could not do that in a poor state. She angrily replied: ``Why can't we lead the lives of normal people?'' (She must now think that normal people own $2,340 Spode soup tureens.) As someone who worked closely with her puts it: ``Hillary, though a Methodist, thinks of herself like an Episcopal bishop who deserves to live at the level of her wealthy parishioners, in return for devoting her life to God and good works.'' Maybe the Clintons have been justifying the unjustifiable for so long they can no longer tell the difference. Sitting on Denise Rich's chairs and Steve Mittman's ottoman, in the lambent light of Walter Kaye's chandelier, they certainly have a lot to ponder. They shouldn't be too pleased with their reflection in Steven Spielberg's china.

thanks for joining us. here's our top story this half hour -- thousands of earthquake survivors are getting ready to spend a second night outside in the aftermath of the powerful tremor that devastated western india yesterday. the official death toll now stands at 11,000. but the indian defense minister says the quake could end up claiming as many as 15,000 lives. 32,000 people are reported injured. the city of ahmedabad, home to 7.7 million people, was especially hard-hit. rescue workers report 50 highrise buildings collapsed. satinder bindra has more. more than a day after a killer earthquake struck western india, hope of finding any survivors is fading fast. in ahmedabad, a densely populated western indian city rescue workers work around the clock using everything at their disposal -- heavy cranes, even their bare hands. for hundreds whose families lie buried underneath the rubble, the wait is excruciating. the news when it comes, unbearable. i have lost everything. yesterday i had some hope, now i have nothing. bhavesh patel has just learned his cousin, whose wedding he'd come to attend, perished in the rubble. two other family members attending the wedding were also killed, and bhavesh's agony is far from over. one of his aunts is still under the rubble. all across ahmedabad, at least 50 high rises have been flattened. fearing aftershocks, thousands of residents slept out in the streets, braving the cold. the indian prime minister has declared the area a disaster zone and is promising relief on a "war footing." thousands of troops are now assisting relief workers. the indian government is also rushing in food, doctors and thousands of tents. what people here want is heavy lifting equipment. as of yesterday, many people have been outraged relief officials could find only one back hoe and a crane to shift through the rubble of what was once a high school. 70 students were once trapped here. first their parents waited and prayed. now, as even the army seems doubtful, the will and fortitude of many parents is breaking down. i have only one wish that my child comes back alive out of the debris. i don't want to say anything else. i just want my child back alive. scenes of such sorrow are playing out elsewhere, too, as the smoke of funeral pyres floats over the city. it's god who saves, and it's god who decides when we die. back in the rubble, bhavesh patel doubts his aunt is alive and is overcome by feelings of helplessness. who can i blame? what can i do? thousands of other families across western india share that sentiment. and as people cremate their loved ones, many say the nightmares of the worst quake to hit india in 50 years will haunt them forever. satinder bindra, cnn, ahmedabad, western india.

the countdown to the destruction of russia's mir space station is under way. a russian space transport craft has docked with the 15-year-old orbiter. the unmanned vessel, dubbed "the hearse," will use its load of two tons of fuel to guide mir out of orbit at the end of next month. most of the craft will disintegrate in the earth's atmosphere. any remaining fragments should fall into the pacific ocean. the russian government says it cannot afford to maintain mir and meet obligations to the new international space station.

Although it was a national holiday, 37 teen-agers trooped into the Swami Narayan School for a physics class. Their teacher had threatened punishment if they skipped the extra drill before exams. Less than an hour later, the four-story school collapsed on the young students, burying them as a 7.9-magnitude earthquake jolted the western Indian state of Gujarat and flattened much of this city of 4.5 million. Six children were rescued from the building within hours, but the bodies of 16 were pulled out later. They had been killed by falling concrete slabs or smothered under heaps of dust and masonry when the school came crashing down. A day later, the other 15 teen-agers were still missing. Their parents kept a grim vigil as workers searched frantically and hope faded. ``Until Friday afternoon we could hear the cries of the children. Now we hear nothing,'' police inspector Ramesh Barot said. ``But we are continuing our efforts.'' As the rescuers labored on, mothers of the missing huddled under a makeshift tent while fathers waited alongside the police cordon surrounding the school. The cooked food neighbors brought for the mothers remained untouched. Their whispers and weeping were drowned out by the sound of power drills boring through the concrete. ``I want my son back. Why can't they do something?'' wailed Nainabehn Patel, her eyes red and swollen. Patel's son, Bhowmik, 16, was somewhere under the rubble. She said she had not had a sip of water since she learned he was among those trapped in the school building. ``How can I eat?'' she asked. ``I will wait till they bring me some news.'' Patel's sister, Kokilabehn Mehta, consoled her as she wept. ``We are just waiting, though now we know there is no hope,'' she said. Schools were closed Friday for Republic Day, a national holiday that commemorates the adoption of India's constitution 51 years ago. But Mehta said the teen-agers here had been called in for the extra class to prepare for a physics laboratory test on Saturday. ``And the teacher had said if they don't come for the practice, they'd be punished,'' she said. Three bodies were removed from the debris Saturday. As the body of Prateek Bhatt, a 16-year-old schoolboy, was carried out by firefighters, there was a surge of movement among the hopeful mothers. ``They've found Prateek, our Savitabehn's son,'' one of the women shouted. But the announcement was soon followed by the wails of Savitabehn, as she realized her son was dead. Mahmoud Rafiq, an ambulance driver, said he had been carrying the injured and bodies to the hospital since Friday morning. ``Earlier there were a lot more injured, some with fractures or head or spine injuries,'' he said. ``Today it's only dead bodies.'' Reports that opposition Congress party leader Sonia Gandhi was to visit the site Saturday afternoon sent police officials into a huddle as they chalked out security arrangements and the route she would take through the congested lanes leading to the school. But around the tent where the mothers waited, the news of Gandhi's visit was greeted with silence. ``We don't care who comes, as long as the operations continue,'' said Umesh Panchal, whose 16-year-old son, Nimesh, was among those still in the debris. ``At least give me my son's body back,'' he said.

As police turned water cannons on anti-globalization protesters in a heavy snowfall nearby, Japanese Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori assured world business and government leaders that his country's economic rebound was nearly complete. ``A structure is being put in place that will assure full recovery'' from a decade of economic problems, Mori said. ``Japan is now entering the final stages of this.'' But the International Monetary Fund said it sees Japan as particularly vulnerable to the slowdown in the U.S. economy that is causing it to lower sharply its rosy predictions for the world. A key IMF official told the World Economic Forum, however, that the global economy will stay well out of recession. Despite a local ban on protests, about 150 demonstrators wearing white plastic masks were surrounded by police about half a mile from the Congress Center, shouting slogans and singing. ``Money, power, profit destroys our world,'' said one sign in English. Another banner in German denounced neoliberal economic policy and the ownership of property. When protesters ignored police orders to disperse and sought to march toward the Congress Center, police opened up with water cannons, soaking several dozen. Demonstrators tried to run around barriers erected across the middle of the main street through the town, but began dispersing after about an hour. About 600 other protesters prevented from reaching Davos clashed with police in Landquart, about 25 miles away. Police there said they fired tear gas and rubber pellets after some of the demonstrators attacked security personnel with sticks. Unconfirmed reports said one person was injured in the head. Other protests were staged on an autobahn through the town, in Klosters, a nearby resort favored by the British royal family for skiing vacations, and in Chiasso, a town on the border with Italy. Elsewhere in the country, a group of some 200 protesters spray-painted slogans on the walls of the Geneva-based World Trade Organization but did not manage to break into the lakeside building. Most Swiss newspapers and many local people criticized the security operation as excessive and heavy handed. There was also dismay among tourist officials that the U.S. State Department issued a warning to Americans that visiting Davos could be dangerous during the forum. None of the noise from the demonstration reached the forum, where business and political leaders focused on steadying the global economy, with advice from the finance ministers of Germany and France and former U.S. Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers. IMF Deputy Director Stanley Fischer, told the gathering that ``a lot depends on the United States.'' Because of the recent slowdown in the U.S. economy, the IMF was revising its prediction of last September that the global economy would grow 4.2 percent, Fischer said. The new prediction will be considerably lower, ``possibly in the range of 3.5 percent,'' Fischer said. But, he added, ``we are a long way from a global recession.'' He praised the decision by the U.S. Federal Reserve to cut interest rates and said the prospects of further cuts will help speed the United States through its decline. The Bush administration's plans for a tax cut could help as well if Congress passes it quickly, otherwise the impact will be more over the long term, he added. The U.S. slowdown will have a particularly strong negative effect on Japan and the sales of its electronic products to the United States, Fischer added. At the same time, Germany's Hans Eichel and his French counterpart Laurent Fabius, appealed to oil-producing countries not to cut output too far and risk another sharp rise in world oil prices. ``I understand the OPEC position which aims at a prevention of too sharp a fall in prices,'' Fabius said. ``A reasonable price would be a major contribution to world growth.''

i'm aaron brown. tonight help from around the world is arriving in india, where at least 2500 bodies have been recovered from the rubble of yesterday's earthquake, and the death toll is expected to rise much, much higher. the numbers don't nearly tell the story of the damage, the grief, and the fear in the aftermath of the huge 7.9 quake and the aftershocks that continue today. the epicenter was in the western state of gujarat, the town of bhuj hardest hit. richard gizbert tonight is in india. rescue teams have now reached bhuj, the town closest to the quake's epicenter. much of bhuj has been leveled, but no one knows how many of the 150,000 people who lived here have been buried. field hospitals have sprung up to treat the survivors. funeral pyres have been set alight to honor the dead. ahmed abahd is well south of the epicenter, but this is a city of 5 million. too many of whom lived and worked in shoddily constructed buildings that simply collapsed in the quake. this was a middle school called sacred flower. it was closed yesterday, except for one group of students called in by a dedicated teacher. 40 of the children are confirmed dead so far, and parents are waiting desperately for news of the rest. "there is no sound from under the debris now," he says. "yesterday we could he them. now nothing." rescue teams are working with whatever they can. sometimes it's heavy equipment, sometimes it's just hand tools. and there is growing frustration in this impoverished country with the relief efforts so far. "it's been 24 hours," she says. "my sister's son is trapped. no one is listening to us." another family in shock. they were preparing for a wedding celebration when the quake struck. now, they're planning funerals. the groom lived on what was the fourth floor of this building. he and his mother were among those killed. rescue efforts like this one will continue here throughout the night. many of those who survived this disaster, whose homes actually withstood the earthquake, will not be going home. grieving for their dead and fearful of aftershocks, they're sleeping outside after the worst earthquake to hit india in 50 years. richard gizbert, abc news, amhed abhad, india.

finally from us tonight, growing up. that's really what jennifer cap riads story is about. as the australian open women's tennis championship, her first masters. it took her two quick sets and ten difficult years to get there. the jennifer capriati who took the court last night was all grown up. there she was again, as she had been a decade before, pounding the ball, pounding an opponent, defeating handily the number one player in the world, martina hingis. i'm no longer going to doubt myself in anything now. if i could come home with a gnd slam, you know, then i know for sure that anything is possible. this was destiny delayed. at 14 she was, she was told, the future of american tennis. the next tracy austin. the next chris evert. the next american sweetheart. child living in an adults' world, perfection required. adolescence intervened. under the weight of expectation and unwanted fame, in full teenage rebellion, she dropped out of tennis in 1993. and so this is how many remember jen -- a mug shot after a marijuana bust, which had followed an arrest for shoplifting. she was out of control, miserable, and it showed. the road back has been tough. there were tears at a press conference two years ago when she was looking forward and porters were looking back. i just wish i didn't have to talk about this stuff. but last night in melbourne, she was finally fit and strong and grown up and confident enough to act like the child that was almost lost. a hug for her father and coach. but this moment was not for him or anyone else. this time, perhaps for the first time, jen won for jen. who would have thought i would have ever made it here after so much has happened? but, you know, dreams do come true, and you just keep believing in yourself, and anything can happen. the score, 6-4, 6-3, capriati of course.

Swiss police have broken up anti-globalization protests near the Summit site of the Forum in Davos. About 300 protestors were able to slip around tight security in the resort town Saturday but further roadblocks and teargas prevented the demonstrators from reaching the venue. At the Forum an official from the International Monetary Fund lowered predictions for world economic growth this year because of the sharp slowdown in the US economy.

Welcome to another hour of news and information on the Voice of America. I am David Chadwick with VOA News Now. Authorities in India's State of Gujarat say they have recovered more than 2500 bodies of people who died in Friday's earthquake, which had a magnitude of 7.9. It killed as many as 13,000 people, another 14,000 are injured. VOA's Jim Teeple reports from the State's most populous city. Workmen do their best to saw through the twisted metal girders and concrete at the Swami Narayanan school in a crowded Ahmedabad neighborhood. The school, which early Friday stood four stories tall, is now just a series of flattened concrete slabs. More than 30 children died inside the school when it collapsed around them early Friday. Only a handful of children survived. One of them, Jayshree Chandrika Thadani lies in the nearby LG Hospital with a broken leg surrounded by her relieved relatives. Jayshree says she cannot stop thinking about her lost friends. She says that she has escaped but her fellow-students all who have been dead, say supposingly dead, who have yet not been rescued. So she's very sad about them. Jayshree says as soon as the quake started, students and teachers rushed into a hallway to get out of the building but the hallway was too small and nearly all were trapped and killed. She says a teacher pulled her away from the building as it collapsed but her leg was smashed by a falling piece of masonry. The students had gone to the school to take a physics exam on Republic Day, a national holiday when nearly all schools and businesses are closed. Search and rescue teams here in Ahmedabad say by late Saturday it was unlikely they would recover anyone alive from the wreckage of about 50 buildings that collapsed in Friday's quake. Examining the wreckage of one apartment house known as the Mansi Building, structural engineer and geologist Jiten Parikh says he believes faulty construction was partially to blame for the collapse of many buildings. Almost 90% of the cases have been due to that because the structures, the limit allowed has been excess, like they take bribes and they allow their excess they don't see what the ground conditions are, they just build the buildings. That is the main reason why the things are happening like this. Life has largely returned to normal for most of Ahmedabad's residents. Most of the city was unscathed by Friday's quake and the Central Services such as water and power were restored to most areas within a matter of hours. State officials say despite the strength of the quake there was little damage to Gujarat's Industrial base. But for many in Ahmedabad life will never return to normal. Many of the grieving parents of the children who died at the Swami Narayanan School, who also blame faulty construction for the deaths of their children, continue to hold a vigil outside the school hoping at least one child will be found alive. Many others remain frightened, too frightened to return to their homes out of a fear of aftershocks. Rohit Trivedi and his family lived across the street from the Mansi Building, the building Jiten Parikh inspected. He says he will never forget what he saw after he fled his own apartment. So within a fraction of one minute we all vacated the premise and we saw the witness the whole Mansi Building collapse like you know pack of cards just collapsing. In front of our eyes, it was my wife was unconscious. Now Rohit Trivedi and his family will not reenter their building until they feel it is safe to do so. They are not alone, many other residents also will not return and have made a temporary camp in a large tent on the grounds of a temple across the street from their homes. Life on the street they say, is preferable at least temporarily, to living with fear. Jim Teeple, VOA News, Ahmedabad. Offers of aid and messages of sympathy are pouring into India from around the world after the deadly earthquake. Pakistani General Pervez Musharraf set aside regional differences to send a message of sympathy to India. He said Pakistan is saddened by the tragic loss of life and property. United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan sent condolences to both countries as a five member UN earthquake assistance team prepares to head to India Sunday. President Bush says he is saddened by the devastation and offered US assistance to the region. Britain says it will send four and a half million dollars in disaster relief aid.

In sports, defending champion Andre Agassi takes on Frenchman Arno Clement Sunday in the finals of the Australian Open tennis tournament in Melbourne. Agassi scored wins over two time US Open winner Patrick Rafter of Australia and Davis Cup teammate Todd Martin on his way to the finals. Clement had a tough five set match against countryman Sebastian Grosjean in the finals. The two players have met four times before, the last time in Lyon France last year with Clement winning when Agassi retired after the first set. Agassi also lost to Clement in the second round of last year's US Open. The lifetime head to head match up is tied at two matches each. And here with more sports is VOA's Dave Byrd. The Baltimore Ravens enter Super Ball 35 much like the New York Giants, a group of players more talented as a team than as individuals. VOA's Jim Stevenson has this look at the Ravens as they make final preparations for Sunday's National Football League championship. The Baltimore Ravens boast the best defense in the League allowing opponents to score just 165 points shattering by 22 points the former record held by the 1986 Super Ball champions Chicago Bears. The Ravens led the NFL in six different defensive categories by the end of the regular season and held three playoff opponents to a total of 16 points. Tackles Tony Seraguso, Sam Adams and line backer Ray Louis anchor the smothering defense. Seraguso says Baltimore is preparing for any new plays the Giants might decide to try in the Super Ball. We're expecting anything because you have a lot of time to install you know new defenses, new offenses, you know gadgets on special teams and whoever handles that the best defensively is going to probably win the game. On offense a revived Trent Dilfer and rookie running back Jamal Louis have led the scoring attack along with receiver Shannon Sharp who won two Super Balls with the Denver Broncos. Dilfer's career sagged with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers before he came to Baltimore, but he says that experience made him better. When you go through difficult times you have two choices, you can get better or you can get better. And I know I can go to my grave knowing that I've gotten better as a football player and as a person because of it. Dilfer and the rest of the Ravens are hoping to add a Super Ball title to their career achievements. In Tampa Florida, Jim Stevenson, VOA sports. The US pro-football Hall of fame named its class of 2001 Saturday with the leader of the infamous No Name defense and the star of the Pittsburgh Stealers among the inductees. Former Miami Dolphins line backer Nick Bonecardi, former Pittsburgh wide receiver Lynn Swan, retired Buffalo Bills coach Marv Levee and Houston Oilers lineman Mike Munchak were named to the Hall of Fame. Bonecardi was a member of the Miami Dolphin's so called No Name defense, which helped lead the team to an undefeated season in 1972. Lynn Swan played on the Pittsburgh Stealers teams that won four Super Ball titles in the 1970s. Two former members of the Los Angeles Rams, tackle Jacky Slater and defensive end Jack Youngblood were named to the Hall. Also named in the class of 2001 was former Minnesota Vikings and Los Angeles Rams tackle Ron Yere. The class will officially be inducted in July in Canton, Ohio. Elsewhere in sports, South Africa's national football team defeated Burkina Faso 1 to nothing in a World Cup Group E qualifying match in South Africa. The result leaves the host nation in second place in its group. Also on Saturday Nigeria defeated Sudan 3 to nothing in a Group B match. And that's sports, I am Dave Byrd. Also in sports earlier today in college basketball Notre Dam defeated Georgetown, Virginia routed Klempson and in a big game tonight the University of Maryland is hosting Duke University.

Next on VOA, Issue in the News. Correspondents offer their views on developments in the news. The panel this week includes David Lynch of USA Today and Tom de Frank, Washington Bureau Chief of the New York Daily news. The Moderator is Martin Shram of the Scripts Howard News Service. Here is Mr. Shram. President George W Bush devoted his first week in office to a major push on his favorite issue, education and he received a major boost on the favorite issue of Conservatives, tax cuts. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan cleared his support for reducing taxes to head off a recession. Meanwhile former President Bill Clinton continued to make news in abstentia. His flurry of last minute Presidential pardons came under attack from Republicans, from Democrats and in the news media. Californians struggled with shortages of electric power and soaring utility prices. It was a crisis caused by a badly botched deregulation effort. And in Davos Switzerland economists from around the world gathered at their annual Economic Forum as the forces of globalization remained as strong as ever. Well we've got a world of news to talk about and most of it happening in Washington with a new President tackling issues, domestic and international. Tom, talk a bit if you will about George Bush's first week, first of all general observations and then we'll get into the specifics. Well I think he had a pretty good first week Marty, he is trying to set a new tone in Washington after the action packed Clinton years to put it mildly and I think he's basically succeeded. He's done a couple of symbolic things early, he's done an instant makeover of the Oval office, the Royal Blue Clinton rug has been removed and replaced with a very elegant ivory rug that was in the Oval office under President Ronald Reagan. I think that was a symbolic message on several levels. But he's, as you're right, he spent the week almost exclusively focused on education. He's gone to minority schools in the district of Colombia, he's met with Congressional leaders to talk education, he's met with... Congressional leaders of both parties. Of bi-partisan leaders. He spent a lot of time actually, I think one of the hallmarks of the early days of the Bush administration will be he will end up spending more time with Democrats than he will with Republicans, trying to reach out to the other side. And I think he has not done, well, he has spent almost all of his time on education and I think he's done very well, he's off to a good start but of course this is very early in the honeymoon, only one week and lots of hurdles and pitfalls remain, but so far the honeymoon seems to be in a fine shape. David, it occurs to me that you must be itching to talk about the change in the color of the Presidential rugs in the Oval office and what everyone in Switzerland is talking about, about that big issue. But instead let's talk about a few general observations overall. In Europe what do people have to say about America's new President and his first days? Well I think people are still puzzling over what the new President, what the new administration, are going to mean. They've gotten used to eight years of Bill Clinton and of course Europeans were far less discomfited by some of his personal indiscretions when there were those puritanical Americans. So they've gotten used to Bill Clinton, they sort of liked him, they liked the US being the global economic engine and so the concern here is or the move really is one of uncertainty. You know will the global economy be able to keep going as the US falters, will Europe be able to step in and pick up the slack and what does this new President have as his agenda? People in Europe are concerned about the administration's plans for a Missile Defense Program, they see that as destabilizing and potentially triggering a new arms race. They're concerned about, one thing that gets a lot of attention, I am based in London and you almost can't go a day without seeing in the papers some snotty reference to the fact that , depending on who's writing the story, that the new President has only been outside the US three times or six times or maybe it's a dozen times, nobody is quite sure what the number is, but certainly his lack of great familiarity with the world prompts a lot of anxious moments. We'll get to that, it occurs to me and I really do want to get to education and tax cuts, but Tom, that if anything is reassuring in that regard it ought to be the fact that Donald Rumsfeld is Defense Secretary and he's a wise old hand, Colin Powell, a respected internationalist as well at State, how do you see that shaping up to ease the concerns that David was encountering from people in Europe? Well and I think we should also add to that list Marty, Vice President Dick Cheney who is also a former Secretary of Defense. How could I leave Dick Cheney out? And who as Secretary of Defense spent a lot of time traveling around the world notably to Europe and Asia. So that's a pretty heavyweight group of advisors for Bush on Foreign Policy. It's true, he does not have a lot of Foreign Policy experience and he's going to focus on domestic policy in the early going. However, he does have a couple of Foreign Policy evincing the works. In about ten days the Prime Minister of Canada, a man who if I recall correctly, Bush couldn't name a year ago, will be coming for a visit and on February 16th Bush will be traveling to Mexico to the ranch of Mexican President Vicente Fox. So he's, and Mexico's a place that George W Bush President Bush knows something about. So I think he's got a good brain trust, he would not pretend to be an expert on Foreign Policy but I think he's a quick learner and I think he doesn't have to do whole lot of heavy lifting in Foreign Policy till later in the year when there's a G-7 Economic Summit. You know we know new Presidents have their problems in general. Ronald Reagan of course once greeted his Secretary of Housing and Urban Development as "Hello Mr. Mayor", so these things do happen. David, were you surprised to see the generally favorable responses of Democrats who met with George Bush on the subject of education, Ted Kennedy for example comes to mind? Not really, but I am not sure how much it means. I mean I think from a distance these initial fairly positive responses are always cordial responses. I think in probably a reflection of the fact that they have a President Elect- not President Elect, a new President, whatever other shortcomings he may have, does seem by all accounts to be an awfully nice guy and somebody who most people find it easy to get along with and to the fact with, and talk and have a cup of coffee and get along with. And he is I think trying to deploy his personality as a political weapon and you know more power to him. Now whether in the long run the sort of initial, again cordial meetings, whether that's going to have any great - I mean it can't hurt, certainly it's going to reduce the level of acrimony between the White House and the Hill, but at the end of the day some of these people still have very different policy preferences than the new administration and the extent to which they're going to be prepared to compromise just because the President's a nice guy, I think remains to be seen. Tom is this honeymoon or is this policy? Well it's honeymoon is what it is. I still think Marty that I am not entirely sure that the Democrats are really prepared to be all that helpful to President Bush. There is still a lot of bitterness leftover from the election. But more than that I think much more than that we have Congressional elections coming now in God help us, twenty one months or so. And I think the Democrats smell a real chance of taking back the United States Senate, which is now equally divided, 50 Democrats, 50 Republicans and so I don't think that the Democrats are going to do much of anything that will help Bush for 2002. I think they're going to be polite, I think they're going to be friendly, I do agree with David that the level of acrimony and finger pointing and name calling will be lessened, but I think the Democrats, just as the Republicans and the President have their own political agendas and I don't think they're particularly bi-partisan at the moment. Let me get through a specific on education, school vouchers. This is the concept by which if students in the very poorest schools, which tend to be those largely in the inner cities, if the schools are failing and not achieving as they're expected to achieve, that the students in those schools would get vouchers in order to get to private schools instead, which in this country usually tend to mean religiously sponsored private schools. What was interesting I thought was that the Democratic leader Daschle, Senator Tom Daschle was not overly negative to the concept that there should be some safety valve for the students that need help in those situations. Maybe the Democrats don't want to fight on an issue that will seem unpopular, what do you think Thomas? Well here's what I think. I think Bush is, no I think the Democrats have to oppose vouchers Marty because they, the Democrats owe the teacher's unions too much. And the teacher's unions in this country are adamantly opposed to vouchers. But Bush is not stupid about these sorts of things, he's willing to compromise. What's being talked about now is you don't have vouchers for at least three years and Bush is also floating a compromise where you begin vouchers with a pilot program, say a half a dozen, take a half a dozen of the poorest and most dilapidated school districts in America and try the concept there first. And so I think President Bush is smart enough to understand that he's got to take some of the tension out of vouchers. So I think ultimately they probably will be able to work a deal on vouchers to take some of the sting out of it for Democrats. Well that's my sense is that as long as people from inner cities feel that they are going to get some relief and as the program isn't too odious, Democrats may find they are in an impossible situation, they can't fight the program as much as they'd like to and that maybe Bush's biggest victory in that area. We'll have more in just a minute. Just a minute David, first let me remind our listeners that they're listening to Issues in the News, coming to you on the Voice of America in Washington. I am your Moderator Martin Shram of the Scripts Howard News Service, joining me are Tom de Frank, the Washington Bureau Chief of the New York Daily News and from Davos, Switzerland David Lynch of USA Today who is speaking right now. Go ahead Dave. Marty I was just going to ask you whether there weren't some voucher proposals on the ballot during the election, my recollection's hazy on this but I am not sure they did as well as initially expected, what's the track record on when they go before the voters? Not very good and dismal as memory serves me I think Governor Jebb Bush of Florida, the President's brother, had a major legislative proposal on vouchers which went down in flames about eighteen months ago. And so they are very controversial especially in areas like Florida where there are a lot of minorities and a lot of Democrats. Another reason why every politician wants to go slow and compromise on that issue, because they don't know where the people are going to wind up and they want to get there first. Let's turn to something that is becoming easy for everybody to support once Alan Greenspan takes the lead and I am talking about tax cuts. Tom, were you surprised that what Alan Greenspan had to say and was George Bush pleased? Well I was a little surprised Marty, I can remember in December during the transitions a couple of aides to the then President Elect were saying to me, " Mark my words, Alan Greenspan is going to support our tax package, not everything we want to do in cutting taxes but at some point soon he'll say something". It's really interesting I don't think they knew what they were talking about, they're whistling in the dark, they got lucky Thomas. I am not sure, but all I can say is that when George Bush came to Washington on his first trip after being certified the winner of this election, his first function was a private breakfast with Alan Greenspan who, let's not forget, is very close to Dick Cheney the Vice President, very close to Paul O'Neill the Secretary of the Treasury, very close to former President Bush, the President's father and I think there was, I think - I think Greenspan tipped him off because about a week later Bush said, "Well, I wouldn't be surprised if Chairman Greenspan is more receptive to tax cuts than you think". Now they might have gotten lucky in the sense Marty that there were some new, as we all know there were some new economic figures which suggested that a recession really might be around the corner and I think that shook Greenspan up and he's already cut interest rates and he may do so again very shortly. But obviously George Bush, President Bush was very pleased about this, he issued a statement late last week saying he was extremely happy with what the Chairman Greenspan had done. Hey Marty the interesting thing to me, looking at Greenspan's comments though, was something he said that does sort of undercut the rationale that has been using to argue for the tax cuts You read my mind, go ahead David. Exactly. Well the President has been saying you know with the slowing economy we need tax cuts to sort of give in a jolt step on the gas pedal and get the economy going again. And of course Democrats, many economists if not most, and also Mr. Greenspan yesterday were saying you know that the timing of these things is so difficult to get right that by the time you get a tax cut proposal, proposed through the Congress, enacted and then it takes effect and begins to actually affect the economy, nine times out of ten the recession we're trying to cure is already over with. And now Greenspan did say it'd be a good insurance policy to have that tax cut if what we think is going to be a short mile downturn begins to turn into something longer, more sustained than having some fiscal stimulus might be just what the doctor ordered. But you know it works both ways. There are some early indications from the retail sales numbers in the first few weeks of January that indicate that consumers are opening their wallets again and so if the economy starts to rev up and get going whether from these interest rates cuts or just from people starting to spend again, as the debate over tax cuts goes forward it might look like well gee you know the really economy doesn't need the extra gas. Right that's speaking of unexpected support. It seems to me we could almost the case that George Bush received some unexpected help from Bill Clinton who made himself a figure of controversy even out of office. Tom, talk about the last minute pardons and the most controversial of them. Well you can always count on the Clintons, just when you think they are going to go quietly, you know they never will go quietly. On the, literally at 11 o'clock in the evening on President Clinton's last full day in office, the White House kind of out the back door issued pardons, or I'll take it back, these were issued on the morning of the transfer from Clinton to Bush. Exactly. On the morning of January 20th the White House issued a massive pardon list of almost 200 individuals who either have been pardoned by the President or had sentences commuted. The most notorious of them, of the pardons was for a New York City businessman named Mark Rich who was indicted in 1983 on what was then the biggest tax fraud and embezzlement case in the history of the United States. Rather than face trial on about 48 counts, he fled the country to Switzerland where he still lives and is a fugitive from justice until the President pardoned him. It later turned out - former President Clinton pardoned him, it later turned out of course that he and his wife, That Rich and his wife. That Rich and his wife were major contra - had been major contributors to the Democratic Party. Rich's ex-wife I should say Denise Rich had intervened with the President directly and that Rich had hired the former White House Council, a guy named Jack Quinn, who had taken this appeal directly to President Clinton and bypassed the Justice Department, which is a normal procedure and there is a firestorm to put it mildly here on this, even former Justice Department officials who worked for President Clinton are saying publicly that it was a disgraceful thing that he has done. And I think this is the sort of thing that just suggests that his legacy is going to be much more complicated, I think this is blown up in his face. David, Mark Rich maybe a foreign name to Americans. He's kind of a local boy there in Switzerland, are you hanging around with him a lot? Well, I've had my eyes peeled. Yeah this has been his exile I gather since he's been on the . his . yes. Yes his and I am sure it's just purely coincidence that he and his wife have been big bucks donators to the Clintons. You know this is a but as egregious a case of political influence, peddling and shameful misuse of Executive authority that you could conceive of and you know I rarely like to quote the competition but the Washington Post had an editorial the other day that I think summed it up pretty nicely, taking account of this pardon and also the fact that the Clintons loaded up the back of a Vauxhall with as many as free gifts from their friends in Hollywood and elsewhere as they could possibly stuff into the car before they left town. You know the Washington Post said the Clintons simply have no capacity for embarrassment. Well that's probably right. Tom I am going to deprive you of the chance to talk about those gifts, which I'm sure you could go on about for a bit and talk instead about the problem that Californians are facing, we have just a couple of minutes to talk about that. Please talk about the power crisis, the price of power crisis in California and deregulation done in the worst way. Well it is a classic example of a deregulation scheme gone amuck, to put it mildly Marty. California of course is the golden State, the land for fruit and honey and everybody is supposed to be fine, living the good life in California. But suddenly there is sticker shock all up and down California because of massive increases in electric bills and what happened, they put together a deregulation scheme where basically wholesalers could raise the price of electricity to the giant utilities, the electric utilities in Californian like Pacific Gas and Electric and Southern California Edison. After prices came off for the wholesalers but not the retailers, the utility companies found themselves with a staggering amount of debt, which recently had exploded to 12 billion dollars and now they're of course trying to recover that slowly but the biggest problem is there were energy shortages all up and down the State and for the last several weeks there've been instances of what are called rolling blackouts where for an hour in San Diego the lights would go down and then an hour later in Fresno or Northern California and there really has been an energy crisis. And the Federal government, it's gotten so bad that the Federal government has intervened and now excess power in places like Washington State and Oregon, at least temporarily is flowing to California to help ease the crisis, but President Bush has said he'll only let that happen for another couple of weeks. That's right and then President Bush says no more, in the end it will be his crisis as well if it becomes a crisis unresolved in California. David, let's talk about the gathering in Switzerland there. Is this a case of economists trying to see how many languages they can say on one hand and on the other hand or is this going to be something that we'll long remember? Well, I think the answer to both questions is no. It's not just economists, there's something like 2500 CEOs, economists and world political leaders, sadly not including anybody from the United States although I think that's due to the - there had a very short transition that the new administration had. But you know the one thing that strikes me particularly compared to last year's meeting, a year ago there was a mood of almost triumphalism on the part of US officials. I remember Treasury Secretary Larry Summers was here and I believe he's here again this year and who is sort of straining to avoid triumphalism but you know what the heck, at the time the Dow was cranking along, the Dotcom industry was doing tremendously, the US was the envy of the world and now a year later we've had a Presidential election that can charitably be called a farce, we've got power outages in what used to be the economic miracle, Silicon Valley, and so that mood is gone and people are a lot more worried now about what's coming out of the US, both in terms of the economy and also in terms of this new administration, which many people you know still aren't quite sure what to make off. Are the forces of globalization undiminished or continuing on, you have about 20 seconds to tell me. Well the big fear is the anti-globalization protest here, which has resulted in an unprecedented security barbed wire, submersed machine gun toting guards, people are feeling, well, I think a little bit embattled as they sip the champagne. It begins to sound like they're counting votes in Florida under those same conditions. David, thank you very much, Tom, thank you and to our listeners, we're out of time, thank you for listening.

Turkish police detained two human rights activists Saturday _ an American and a Briton _ as they tried to make a statement to reporters on conditions in Turkey's new prisons. Prisoners solidarity group Ozgur Tayad identified the activists as Juliette June Wales of the United States and Stephen Kaczynski of Britain. They are part of a five-member international delegation investigating prison conditions, but it was not clear which organization they represented. Their Turkish translator, Sibel Sahin, was also detained. A British consular official confirmed that Kaczynski had been detained and was carrying a British passport. Wales has both British and U.S. citizenship but came to Turkey with an American passport, the British official said. A U.S. consular official, speaking on condition of anonymity, confirmed that a U.S. citizen had been detained, but had not been charged. The official did not identify the citizen by name. Police refused to comment on the detentions. It is illegal in Turkey to make statements in public places without permission from authorities. Last month, the government transferred more than 1,000 inmates linked to outlawed political groups from large dormitory-style prison wars to one- or three-person cells. Fearing the smaller cells would make them vulnerable to torture and abuse at the hands of guards, the inmates staged hunger strikes. Authorities stormed prisons throughout Turkey last month in raids that left 30 prisoners and two soldiers dead. Some prisoners have continued their hunger strikes. Others say they have been beaten and tortured in the cells. Amnesty International and the New York-based Human Rights Watch have called for an independent investigation into the torture allegations, which the Turkish Justice Ministry denies.

Police fired water cannons, tear gas and rubber pellets Saturday at activists protesting a meeting of world economic leaders in this Alpine resort, and angry protesters turned back from Davos rioted in Zurich, burning cars and smashing windows. Police surrounded several hundred protesters in Davos, where local authorities had banned demonstrations during the annual World Economic Forum. After issuing warnings over loudspeakers, police opened up with a water cannon on demonstrators who tried to get around a fence erected across the main street. In Landquart, where police stopped hundreds on their way to Davos, protesters blocked roads and police said they fired tear gas and rubber pellets after demonstrators attacked security personnel with sticks. One person was reportedly injured. As evening fell, some 400 demonstrators sent back to Zurich on a special train from Landquart rioted, breaking windows, burning cars and overturning trash containers and burning cars, authorities said. Police fired water cannons and rubber pellets. The demonstrators said police had met their train ``with tear gas guns drawn.'' Police in Zurich said the damage from the worst violence in recent years in the Swiss financial capital was ``massive,'' but they had no immediate estimate of its cost. The protesters claim increasing liberalization of world trade and investment leads to improved living standards for the rich and higher profits for business at the expense of the poor and the environment. Demonstrators said that despite the protest ban _ and heavy snowfall _ they were determined to deliver their message against spreading globalization to the corporate bosses and other financial leaders meeting in Davos. ``We have to fight for the right to freedom of expression,'' said Kees Hudig, who came from Amsterdam. He called the police response an overreaction. The forum opened Thursday, and authorities had tightened the seal around Davos, Europe's highest city in elevation, but numerous demonstrators said they managed to slip in anyway. ``It is a right I have to move freely in my country any time I want,'' said a woman from Zurich who gave only her first name, Carmen. ``Until today I didn't realize I lived in a police state.'' Hundreds of demonstrators were stopped at Landquart, about 25 miles from Davos, where they blocked a major rail line between Zurich and many of eastern Switzerland's ski resorts. With helicopters buzzing overhead and barbed wire fences erected at strategic points, the country's winter tourist heartland resembled a battle zone rather than an Alpine paradise. Davos itself was almost cut off from the outside world. Most stores closed for the afternoon and McDonald's, which had its windows smashed last year, disappeared behind protective boards. Elsewhere in Switzerland, a group of some 200 protesters spray-painted slogans on the walls of the Geneva-based World Trade Organization but did not manage to break into the lakeside building. Scuffles were also reported in Klosters, a nearby ski resort, and police used water cannons in Chiasso, on the Italian border, to disperse protesters trying to enter Switzerland. Most Swiss newspapers and many residents criticized the security operation as excessive. Tourist officials were dismayed by a U.S. State Department warning to Americans that visiting Davos could be dangerous during the forum.

Soldiers pulled out three people trapped under rubble for 36 hours, the first found alive under collapsed buildings from India's devastating earthquake. Another powerful tremor Sunday shook the area, where 13,000 are feared dead from the disaster. An army engineers corp, among the 5,000 Indian soldiers deployed in the state of Gujarat, rescued two men and a girl on Saturday afternoon after digging through the fallen masonry of their homes in Bhuj, the town closest to the epicenter of Friday's 7.9-magnitude quake, said Capt. Amartej Singh. The condition of the three people was not immediately known. It was not known if they were related. Singh said his unit also recovered 10 bodies. But bolstered by their success in saving three lives, the soldiers started digging on Sunday through another mountain of rubble where a resident said he could hear his brother's voice. Rambhai Mulshankar, a 40-year-old goldsmith, led the soldiers to his fallen house. ``I can even now hear my brother's cries for help,'' Mulshankar said.

Former president Alan Garcia returned from exile to the cheers of supporters Saturday, launching his drive to recapture the presidency of the homeland he fled nearly a decade ago amid charges of corruption. Garcia _ who came to power a young populist but ended his term in 1990 amid annual inflation topping 7,600 percent, surging rebel violence and rampant corruption _ landed at Lima's international airport shortly before sunset and immediately hit the campaign trail ahead of April 8 elections. Reviled by many Peruvians as a silver-tongued crook who should never have returned, Garcia was met at the airport upon arrival from Colombia by some 3,000 placard-waving supporters, most members of his left-leaning Aprista party. ``After nine long years, I am here to confirm for all of you my commitment, my profound belief in Peru and its youth,'' Garcia told a cheering crowd of tens of thousands at a rally hours later in a downtown Lima Plaza. Hunched over a podium draped with red and white fabric, the colors of Peru's flag, he told the multitude: ``In this dramatic hour in which there is uncertainty, disillusion, anger and pain, I come to Peru with a proposal of hope, of work, of decentralization and democracy.'' Garcia, 51, tall and still dark-haired, comes back to a country rocked by corruption scandals left behind by his nemesis, former President Alberto Fujimori, who had long sought to imprison him. Fujimori is now in exile in Japan after being forced from office in November by the scandals surrounding his former spy chief, Vladimiro Montesinos. Peru's Supreme Court recently paved the way for Garcia's return with a ruling that the statute of limitations had run out on outstanding charges that he took bribes and kickbacks totaling several million dollars. He always denied the allegations and attributed them to political persecution by Fujimori's government. A special state's attorney assigned to his case is appealing the court decision. Garcia hopes to re-ingratiate himself with Peruvians increasingly cynical over the release of videos secretly recorded by Montesinos implicating judges, politicians, military leaders and businessmen in a web of corruption at the core of Fujimori's administration. But for many here, Garcia personifies an era marked by mismanagement, food shortages, corruption and rebel car bomb attacks and assassinations. ``The people have amnesia,'' said Aquiles Reyes, 70, who stood at the outskirts of Garcia's welcoming rally. ``His government was crazy. They were thieves. They stole everything from the country. I'll kill myself if Alan becomes president.'' Garcia swept into office in 1985 as Latin America's youngest president at the age of 36, hailed as ``the president of hope'' and dubbed ``Latin America's Kennedy.'' Initially, his policies provided an artificial economic boom, spurred by massive spending that depleted Peru's reserves. He froze foreign debt payments at 10 percent of export earnings, turning Peru into a pariah among multinational lenders. Peru's economy collapsed, and Maoist Shining Path guerrillas surged in strength. By his last year in office in 1990, inflation topped 7,600 percent. After Garcia, most Peruvians initially tolerated, even lauded, Fujimori's iron-fisted rule, grateful to him for taming the rebel insurgencies and cleaning up an economic disaster. Garcia enters the race in a statistical dead heat with two other candidates for a distant second place behind U.S.-trained economist Alejandro Toledo, who is considered the early favorite to win. But many believe Toledo will not get 50 percent of the vote and will have to face the runner-up in a second round.

Soldiers pulled out three people trapped under rubble for 36 hours, the first found alive under collapsed buildings from India's devastating earthquake. Another powerful tremor Sunday shook the area, where 13,000 are feared dead from the disaster. An army engineers corp, among the 5,000 Indian soldiers deployed in the state of Gujarat, rescued two men and a girl on Saturday afternoon after digging through the fallen masonry of their homes in Bhuj, the town closest to the epicenter of Friday's 7.9-magnitude quake, said Capt. Amartej Singh. The condition of the three people was not immediately known. It was not known if they were related. Singh said his unit also recovered 10 bodies. But bolstered by their success in saving three lives, the soldiers started digging on Sunday through another mountain of rubble where a resident said he could hear his brother's voice. Rambhai Mulshankar, a 40-year-old goldsmith, led the soldiers to his fallen house. ``I can even now hear my brother's cries for help,'' Mulshankar said. BHUJ, India: Mulshankar said. About 2,500 bodies have been recovered so far. One official has said the death toll will reach 13,000 from the 7.9 magnitude temblor that hit Gujarat Friday. The rescue of the three people was the first report of anyone being pulled out alive from the rubble. On Sunday, an aftershock of about 5.9 magnitude hit the area, said V.K. Shukla, a seismologist at the government meteorology center in India's capital, New Delhi. The exact magnitude has not been calculated, but it is in the range of 5.9 and 6, with an epicenter about 12 miles from the epicenter of Friday's quake, he said. People rushed out of their homes as they were woken up by the tremor around 6.45 a.m. in Ahmedabad, the commercial capital of Gujarat state, where more than 400 people died in Friday's quake. Homeless people sleeping in the open in biting cold also were woken up. While thousands of rescuers clawed at the rubble, stunned survivors waited for authorities to distribute water, food or medicine. Others refused to eat, keeping a tearful vigil as emergency workers' drills bit into concrete in search of their buried loved ones. In Bhuj district at the quake's epicenter, thousands of terrified people had fled in cars, jeeps and on foot, carrying their belongings. Many had been walking since soon after the temblor struck. Buses and trucks were forced to stop before a cracked bridge on a dry river that connects the district with the rest of the state. ``We have been walking since morning. We are fleeing for our lives,'' said Harjivan Vyas, 37, a factory worker in Bhuj town. ``There is no drinking water, no food. All houses are destroyed.'' Friday's quake struck on Republic Day, a national holiday. It shook the earth for more than 1,200 miles, but it hit hardest in Gujarat state, pulverizing cities and towns and bringing multistory buildings down like houses of cards. Gujarat Home Minister Haren Pandya said 2,500 bodies had been recovered already and more than 14,000 people were injured. The state's transport minister said the death toll would soar. ``It will be more than 10,000 in the Kutch district alone,'' Bimal Shah told The Associated Press, referring to the region near the Pakistan border where the quake was centered. ``For the rest of the state it would be 2,000 or 3,000.'' Shah's comment was based on aerial surveys. His death toll estimate _ a much higher number than officials suggested earlier in the day _ was an indication that emergency crews had given up hope of finding many survivors under the debris. Among those buried were 350 children who had been taking part in a parade for Republic Day, which commemorates the adoption of India's constitution 51 years ago. They were marching through a Kutch street when several houses toppled onto them.

Soldiers digging through the ruins of crushed buildings Sunday pursued the faint voices of survivors of India's devastating earthquake, bolstered by the rescue of three people from the rubble. Home Minister Haren Pandya of the western state of Gujarat said 6,072 people were confirmed killed in Friday's quake, and the total was likely to be thousands more. ``There are many bodies buried inside, and there are many places with which we have no communications,'' he said. Police on Sunday were also hunting for some 200 criminals who escaped from a collapsed jail, Pandya said. Another magnitude-6 tremor shook the area Sunday morning. It was the largest aftershock yet, but no new damage was reported. The quake was centered 12 miles from the epicenter of Friday's 7.9 temblor. Since Friday, more than 275 aftershocks have been reported, 20 of them above magnitude 5. In a newly developed portion of Bhuj, lime and chlorine disinfectants mixed with the smell of dead bodies. People moved possessions from their homes and set up makeshift camps in two open areas using bed sheets as tents. ``This is death and destruction,'' said a bearded old Muslim man, sitting morosely on a string cot in Bhuj, the worst affected town. He refused to talk about his family and wouldn't give his name. ``I am just an unfortunate Indian. That is enough.'' In many buildings, the first floor had been shattered by the rocking earth while intact upper stories teetered precariously. At least three separate rescue operations were launched in Bhuj in places where residents reported hearing sounds of people. One of the sites was the Vaibhav Lakshmi apartment complex, a five-story building that that completely collapsed in a 15-foot-high pile of debris. ``We don't know who may be in there, but we heard sounds,'' said junior warrant officer R.P. Sachan. ``So many dead bodies have been brought out of this building.'' Sachan and his crew were using new cutting equipment and pneumatic jacks brought in by air force planes. In one place, rescuers made eye contact with a woman, Naina Badrasen Aur, and her 18-month-old daughter, Namrata, but had been unable to reach them. On Saturday, soldiers among the 5,000 Indian troops deployed in Gujarat rescued two men and a girl after digging through the fallen masonry of their homes in Bhuj. Indian Agriculture Minister Bhaskar Barua said the International Committee of the Red Cross had offered thousands of blankets, the Swiss government had sent sniffer dogs and assistance was also being accepted from the United States, Russia, Germany and Turkey. Norway and China had offered monetary aid, and Taiwan was prepared to send rescue workers. Japan offered to send 35 rescuers but they were being held up by bureaucratic delays in India, Shusaki Hirashima, a Foreign Ministry official, said in Tokyo. Japan pledged nearly $1 million in cash and supplies. On Sunday, relief planes were landing every 10 minutes at Bhuj airport, where the terminal had been flattened but the runway survived. State carrier Air India announced Sunday it would waive cargo charges for relief material from anywhere in the world destined for the quake site. Jet Airways, a private Indian carrier, also was transporting relief supplies free of charge. More than half the houses in Bhuj, a city of 150,000 people, were reduced to rubble and the rest were damaged. In the congested old part of the city, dogs, pigs and cows foraged for food in streets made narrower by mounds of rubble. In one house, a clothes line hung limply with washed clothes caked with dust. Electricity poles were strewn everywhere. Thousands of terrified people fled in cars, jeeps and on foot, carrying their belongings. Many began walking just after the temblor struck. ``We are fleeing for our lives,'' said Harjivan Vyas, 37, a factory worker in Bhuj town. ``There is no drinking water, no food. All houses are destroyed.'' Among the dead were 50 teachers and 400 children parading through the narrow old city streets of Ajnar during Republic Day holiday celebrations. They were killed almost instantly when the earthquake knocked buildings down onto them from either side, said Bangaru Laxman, president of the Bharatiya Janata Party of Prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee. Ajnar is 30 miles southeast of Bhuj. The quake was the most powerful to strike India since Aug. 15, 1950, when an 8.5-magnitude temblor killed 1,538 people in northeastern Assam state.

thanks for joining us. here's a look at our top story. there are some reports of rescues, but the death toll from the indian earthquake is expected to rise dramatically. more than 11,000 are confirmed dead since the quake friday. one indian official suggests the number could reach 20,000 to 30,000 in one western city alone. thousands of indian troops are aiding in efforts to uncover people trapped under the rubble. the government is also sending cranes, generators, and other equipment. hospitals in the commercial capital of ahmedabad are treating a steady stream of injured. in addition to providing medical assistance, officials say getting food and water to survivors is a top priority. the city of bhuj has been hardest hit by the quake. satinder bindra reports on rescue and medical relief efforts there. in the midst of all this death, destruction and despair, finally some hope. rescue workers have just pulled out 25 survivors. rama ben survived three days without food and water, buried under tons of rubble. they tried to take me out two days ago but failed. today, they took me out, but nobody thought of giving me water while i was buried. doctors say rama ben has a fractured left leg. she will soon be taken into emergency surgery. in the town of bhuj, relief workers and army soldiers have so far pulled out 1,000 injured survivors. many are children. all the survivors in bhuj are rushed to a makeshift, open-air army hospital because the quake demolished the town's main hospital. in the first few hours of the tragedy, dr. gautam lahiri was the only surgeon on the scene. he says he performed 50 operations in 12 hours and was frequently mobbed. they were basically trying to touch me, pull me in their direction -- telling me, to do my case first, take my child, why are you not taking my child first? to deal with 33,000 injured people in the quake zone, the indian government is now rushing in medical teams. over the past few days, army surgeons say they've performed 1,000 serious operations out in the open. at least 200 people have had their limbs amputated. hundreds of others have skull injuries, crushed bones and concussions. doctors say all these people are also emotionally traumatized. many so terrified of aftershocks, they prefer to sleep in the open rather then return to their demolished homes. survivor rama ben is still too shocked to decide what to do. all my children have died. my husband has died. i had three children. rama ben's only other daughter, urvashi jethwa, lives in leicester, england. she wants her to know she survived india's worst quake in 50 years. satinder bindra, cnn, bhuj, western india.

now turning to the tragedy overseas. in india, it was another long day of grim work. rescuers have been searching for earthquake survivors for three days. they found over 6,000 bodies and expect to find many thousands more. but as abc's richard gizbert reports, rescuers are not giving up yet. two days after the earthquake and 21 hours after they heard her calls for help, indian rescue workers finally pulled a 40-year-old women out of the rubble today. our army boys have made it successful and have been able to save a life. but it was just one life saved, among the thousands already lost here. this city's main hospital was flattened in the quake and a soccer stadium has turned into a field hospital. but the demand for aid of all kinds far outstrips the supply. we have specialists -- india clearly needs outside help and they got it today when a british search and rescue team arrived in bhuj. the british say if there are people still alive in the debris it's not too late to save them. it really depends on the way they're trapped, the kind of pocket that they're in and whether it's survivable on a little bit of water and food, which can help keep them going. the british team was immediately given a list of damaged buildings that the local police chief says contain the greatest numbers of missing people. you believe people are alive in these places? we expect people to be alive there. this is one of those buildings -- apartments that just three days ago were home to 32 families. the only survivors lived on the top floor, which remains largely intact. this wall clock was still keeping time there. the tragedy for 25-year-old onkar athale is that his parents lived on a lower floor. he took me to see what is left of their apartment. there it is, a checkered shirt over there. my father used to wear that one. and this mattress, also, i recognize. and when you saw this, what happened to your hopes? i lost my hopes. and what onkar and the others at this site cannot yet see, they can already smell. it's the stench of death. it's unmistakable, and in this city, it's unavoidable. richard gizbert, abc news, bhuj, india.

now to india and the devastating earthquake that officials now believe may have killed as many as 20,000. on day three, the search for survivors continues, but hopes are fading fast in the quake zone where nbc's ron allen is tonight. the grueling, desperate efforts to find survivors paid off today. a 40-year-old woman, only her arm visible under the rubble since the quake, walked away from the deadly pile of concrete and steel. her rescuers believe many more victims are trapped beneath the crushed building, but time is fast running out to find anyone else alive. there were two other rescues today. an elderly woman and man carried away to safety, the extent of their injuries unknown. but three days after the massive 7.9 quake hit, they're alive. now, help is arriving from around the world. rescue teams hoping they're not too late. what we have to do is, to be as quickly as possible to the different scenes where we have hope to find people still alive and where we can rescue them. however, throughout the vast area of devastation, home to 40 million people, there is little good news. thousands of families now gather around cremation fires, mourning. this morning, the quake zone shook again, a magnitude 6 tremor sent people scurrying into the streets. it was the strongest of some 275 aftershocks. i'm really very much afraid, i'm very afraid. people roam the streets, afraid to go back inside damaged homes. many now live under tents in the open air. even hospitals are treating patients outside. in the hardest-hit town, bhug, more than half the houses in a community of 150,000 have been damaged or destroyed. and there are still areas the rescue effort have not reached. outlaying towns and villages with no communication. the magnitude of the disaster here is still unfolding. ron allen, nbc news, india.

Switzerland counted the cost Sunday of mayhem unleashed by anti-globalization protesters outraged at being the target of the country's biggest security operation since World War II. As political controversy mounted over whether police themselves were to blame for Saturday night's violence, newspaper commentaries likened Switzerland to a dictatorship. Demonstrators gathered Sunday afternoon in Zurich _ the scene of pitched battles late Saturday between riot police firing tear gas and water cannons and demonstrators prevented from reaching the World Economic Forum meeting in the Alpine resort of Davos, about 90 miles away. Police arrested 121 people _ mostly Swiss and German _ from a mob of 1,000 militants ``intent on violence,'' Esther Maurer, president of the Zurich police department, told a news conference. She said the level of violence had rarely been witnessed in the Swiss financial capital. Two policemen were injured by stones and one soldiers was trampled to the ground and his weapons stolen. Maurer said the fact that all police were clad in full riot gear prevented a higher casualty toll. Authorities said the damage ran into the hundreds of thousands of dollars. Hundreds of passengers were trapped in Zurich's main railway station _ many of them feeling the effects of tear gas aimed at demonstrators. Prevented from occupying the station and reaching the nearby Bahnhofstrasse _ one of the world's most exclusive shopping streets _ protesters then went on a rampage in downtown Zurich. They set fire to cars, smashed windows and spray-painted buildings. However, Swiss newspapers Sunday were virtually unanimous in putting the blame on authorities. ``Police methods just like a dictatorship,'' headlined the tabloid SonntagsBlick. An editorial said that the ``police coup'' had inflicted more damage on the World Economic Forum and its professed goals of dialogue than demonstrators ever could have. ``The Davos opponents won. Despite the police,'' commented the French-language Dimanche.ch. ``The spirit of Davos suffocated in tear gas,'' said the respected SonntagsZeitung, in reference to the Alpine meeting's atmosphere credited with forging groundbreaking political accords and multibillion economic deals over the years. Peter Bosshard, of the Declaration of Bern, a Swiss group taking part in a parallel conference in Davos of non-governmental critics of globalization, said that the police behavior was ``totally out of proportion.'' He said the ban on demonstrations fueled the violence. The Socialist party _ of which Swiss President Moritz Leuenberger is a member _ condemned the ban as a violation of free speech. The Swiss Trade Union Federation accused authorities of ``violating basic principles of democracy.'' However, center and right-wing parties defended the massive security operation as necessary to protect the world's elite and to ensure that Switzerland hosts the prestigious Davos conference in years to come. ``The freedom of the demonstrators stops when they endanger the freedom of other people,'' said Peter Aliesch, a local government leader in the state of Graubuenden that ordered the ban on demonstrations. John Sweeney, president of the AFL-CIO, umbrella organization for U.S. labor unions, urged forum leaders to listen to nonviolent critics such as workers, environmentalists and religious leaders rather than ``the few who are violent.'' South African President Thabo Mbeki gave similar advice but he urged the forum participants to face up to the shortcomings of globalization. The world needs ``a new internationalism'' that bridges the divide between rich and poor, Mbeki said. ``The problems of the poor are also the problems of the rich.''

Exhausted searchers using everything from sophisticated rock-cutting tools to their bare hands clawed through rubble Sunday, hoping to find survivors lingering among the thousands believed buried by western India's massive earthquake. More than 6,000 bodies had been found since Friday's quake, and the death toll was expected to go much higher. Some authorities estimated it would reach 10,000; others said 16,000 or more. A leading rescue official said there could be up to 30,000 dead in one town alone. As India's prime minister appealed for help, frantic rescuers and sniffer dogs uncovered a few signs of life Sunday amid the destruction in Gujarat, the western Indian state that took the brunt of the blow. In Anjar, 30 miles southeast of the hardest-hit town, Bhuj, a 3-year-old girl was unearthed from the rubble alive. ``She was chanting some Arabic verses,'' said a soldier who participated in the toddler's rescue. ``She was totally unscathed,'' he said, declining to give his name. Across town, sniffer dogs located another sign of life in a heap of rubble. After three hours of digging, soldiers found a man, only his face visible under twisted and crumpled masonry. Unable to reach him, rescuers released water from a plastic pouch, drop by drop, into his mouth. Chipping slowly at the blocks so as not to unsettle the unstable mound, the soldiers removed the pieces of debris one by one. Three hours later, the man was free, and a cheer went up in the crowd. Too weak to speak, too exhausted to smile, the man, identified only as Maganbhai, was carried away. In Bhuj, a desert town just miles from the quake's epicenter, workers dug for 30 hours and shouted with joy when they found a baby and her mother alive in the rubble. The digging to free the pair took hours more. When it was finished, the baby girl, 18-month-old Namrata, was still alive, her pulse weak. Rescuers rushed her to the hospital in an ambulance. But the mother, Badrasen Aur, had died in the concrete heap. Next door, a woman named Das had spent two days trapped in bed with the corpses of her husband and young daughter. Her head was bloated and purple from lack of circulation. Rescuers talked to her and gave her water and a biscuit to eat as they struggled to widen the hole they had made in the wall of her sunken bedroom. Authorities will know by Monday if any more people are alive under the rubble, Gujarat State Home Minister Haren Pandya said. The emphasis will then switch to clearing the rubble and removing the dead bodies. Friday's magnitude-7.9 quake _ India's strongest in more than 50 years _ struck on Republic Day, a national holiday here. It shook the earth for more than 1,200 miles and was felt in Nepal, Bangladesh and Pakistan, where 10 people were crushed in their houses. More than half the houses in Bhuj, a city of 150,000 people, were reduced to rubble and the rest were damaged. In the congested old part of the city, dogs, pigs and cows foraged for food in streets made narrower by mounds of rubble. In a newly developed portion of Bhuj, lime and chlorine disinfectants mixed with the smell of dead bodies. People moved possessions from their homes and set up makeshift camps in two open areas using bedsheets as tents. ``This is death and destruction,'' said a bearded old Muslim man sitting on a string cot. He refused to talk about his family and wouldn't give his name. ``I am just an unfortunate Indian. That is enough.'' By Sunday, foreign aid was pouring in: Cranes, generators, cutting tools, sniffer dogs, seismic monitors and poles with long cameras attached had begun to arrive along with experienced teams of rescuers from places such as Switzerland, the United Kingdom and Turkey. Indian Agriculture Minister Bhaskar Barua said about 750 doctors and other health workers, more than 5,000 rescue workers, dozens of bulldozers, 36,000 blankets and 10,800 tents had been sent. But Pandya, the Gujarat home minister, said authorities urgently needed even more rescue equipment and medical supplies. ``The quantum of our need is so much more than what we have,'' he said. Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, who was to tour quake sites Monday, appealed for Indians to contribute, ``no matter how small the amount,'' to help earthquake victims. He said federal emergency funds would not be enough. ``We cannot leave our brothers and sisters to the mercy of fate or the cruelty or vagaries of nature,'' United News of India quoted Vajpayee as saying. The Gujarat state government said 6,181 people were confirmed killed in Friday's magnitude-7.9 quake. More than 14,500 have been injured, the national government said. Estimates of how much higher the death toll would go varied widely. ``There are many bodies buried inside and there are many places with which we have no communications. But our projection is that the toll would be 10,000,'' Pandya said. Gujarat Chief Minister Keshubhai Patel, the state's top official, would say only the toll would reach ``five figures. Five figures can be anything _ 10,000, 20,000.'' Patel said some 125,000 people were ``not accounted for.'' Many could be buried under the rubble, but crowds have taken to the roads since the quake, afraid to stay in Gujarat, and that exodus has added to the confusion as officials try to assess the tragedy. K.N. Mahure, a fire brigade commander in charge of rescue efforts in Bhuj, put the possible toll even higher. ``There may be 20,000 to 30,000 dead in Bhuj alone,'' Mahure said, adding he was basing his estimate on the number reported missing and the number found dead so far. The quake was the most powerful to strike India since Aug. 15, 1950, when an 8.5-magnitude temblor killed 1,538 people in northeastern Assam state. On Sunday morning, a tremor of magnitude 6 shook the Gujarat area. It was the largest of more than 275 aftershocks recorded here since the initial quake.

When the earthquake struck, this city was filled with the voices and giggles of 400 children marching through narrow streets with their teachers in a parade to mark India's Republic Day. Now, two days later, Anjar is overwrought with death, and the silencing of those voices is a potent symbol of the tragedy that struck here: The children and their 50 teachers were swallowed as they marched by the cataclysmic quake that flattened this city and many others. All but eight of the children died when the ground caved in and buildings on both sides of the street crashed over them, said Keshubhai Patel, the chief executive of India's western Gujarat state, where Anjar is located. ``Some 10 to 12 children had been pulled out, out of the 400. Out of these, only eight were alive. The rest perished,'' he said, correcting an earlier report from a leader of his political party who said there were no survivors. Soldiers _ who have traditionally played the role of India's main rescue and relief agency in times of natural disasters _ used sniffer dogs to pull out bodies. Meanwhile, a couple of dogs located a sign of life in a heap of rubble in another part of the town. After three hours of digging, soldiers found a man, only his face visible under twisted and crumpled masonry. Unable to reach him, rescuers released water from a plastic pouch, drop by drop, into his mouth. Chipping slowly at the blocks so as not to unsettle the unstable mound, the soldiers removed the pieces of debris one by one. About two hours later, his torso was free, and another hour of labor had freed him. A cheer went up in the crowd: ``Jai siyaram!'' they shouted _ ``Glory be to Ram!'', a reference to the Hindu warrior god Ram. A makeshift stretcher was fashioned from a bed sheet for the man, identified only as Maganbhai. Four people held the sheet's corners as Maganbhai _ too weak to speak, too exhausted to smile _ was carried away. He had survived in the rubble for two days and two nights without food or water. Also in Anjar, soldiers who had been digging for hours perked up when they heard a small voice chanting. When the slabs of concrete were finally removed, the rescuers found a little girl praying in Arabic, the language of Islam's holy book. The girl, who looked 3 years old, was pulled without a scratch from the rubble of her home Sunday, more than 52 hours after she was buried in the earthquake. Her name was not known and no relatives immediately came forward to claim her, said an army officer who led the rescue. ``She was totally unscathed. I don't know what she was saying but it was in Arabic. Probably something of her religion,'' he told The Associated Press. Like other rescue workers, he refused to give his name, saying it was not important.

African and European leaders are continuing to react positively to a Congolese President Joseph Kabila's call for unity in his troubled nation. European Union special envoy Aldo Ayello held talks Sunday in Kinshasu with President Kabila, who was sworn in Friday to succeed his assassinated father Loron Kabila as leader of the Democratic Republic of Congo. Mr.Ayello said there's a new opportunity for peace in Congo. He promised the European Union will exert all necessary pressure to see that the 1999 Lusaka Peace Accord is carried out. South African President Thabo Mbeki also plans to meet with President Kabila very soon. He said Sunday he hopes another Congolese peace summit can be organized quickly. Former Botswana President , the facilitator of the Lusaka Agreement also said Sunday that a peace deal is the only honorable solution to ending the fighting in Congo.

Rescue workers in India's Gujarat State continue finding some people alive more than 60 hours after Friday's devastating earthquake, which is estimated to have killed more than 20,000 people. Reuters reports that among those rescued Sunday were a seven-year-old boy and his mother who were pulled from the debris in the city of Bhuj. Reports say the 500-year old walled city was almost completely destroyed. The death toll from the earthquake, India's worst in a half century, is certain to rise. Authorities say as many as 125,000 people are missing in and around Bhuj and elsewhere in the region. India is seeking a 1.5 billion dollar disaster loan from the World Bank and the Asia Development Bank.

A few hours after winning the Australian Open, Andre Agassi returned to his hotel soaking wet. Not because of the match _ he hardly broke a sweat in beating Arnaud Clement 6-4, 6-2, 6-2 Sunday. Agassi celebrated with a private swim, apparently duplicating Jim Courier's dive into the nearby Yarra River after winning the title in 1992 and 1993. ``We took a dip,'' said Agassi's coach, Brad Gilbert, who was soaked to the skin, too. Agassi and Gilbert showed up late for a post-tournament photo shot and told Jane Fraser, a representative of the International Tennis Federation, the delay was because of an impromptu splashdown. They wouldn't say where they went, but Fraser said from the looks of them at the hotel earlier _ Gilbert in bare feet, Agassi in a sopping tennis shirt and shorts _ they had hit the river. With seven Grand Slam titles, Agassi is looking for new ways to mark them. The most naturally gifted baseline basher of his generation gives the impression he's improving with age. ``My best tennis can still be ahead of me,'' Agassi said. Agassi was an international celebrity at 18, a Grand Slam finalist at 20 and a Wimbledon champion at 22, so he's not exactly a late bloomer. But on Sunday he joined a rather exclusive club of Grand Slam champions in the 30-and-over division. Boris Becker, Stefan Edberg, Ivan Lendl, John McEnroe and Mats Wilander never won a major title after turning 30. Neither did Courier or Bjorn Borg, who both retired before reaching the milestone birthday. But Agassi, who will be 31 in April, shows no signs of a letup. He has won four Grand Slam titles since turning 29. ``You know, a man needs to work,'' Agassi said with a smile. ``If I do this well, I might as well work here. It's important to me just to pay a price _ to assess how your day was at the end of it. I can't think of a better way to do it than playing the game of tennis.'' Projections are always dangerous with Agassi because his career has been so erratic. He won the 2000 Australian Open, then didn't win another tournament or reach another Grand Slam final the rest of the year. Injuries and illnesses in his family were factors in the slump. But he believes he can build on his third title at Melbourne Park. ``This is a great steppingstone,'' Agassi said. ``I think I'll be a little smarter this year. After this tournament last year, I felt very tired and physically struggling. This year I don't. ``I think if I really play my cards right, this can be the start of an incredible year.'' Agassi has won each of the Grand Slams, and he could win any or all of them again. The next major tournament will be the French Open beginning in May. The younger generation _ Gustavo Kuerten, Marat Safin, Magnus Norman, Lleyton Hewitt _ must be reckoned with, and much can happen in the next 3 1/2 months, but Agassi could very well arrive at Roland Garros as the favorite. His experience, baseline power and exceptional fitness are a formidable combination that allows him to wear opponents down. He did it to Patrick Rafter in the semifinal and then to the 23-year-old Clement in the final. ``He ripped me apart from the baseline,'' Clement said. ``From the backcourt, nobody in the world could have beaten him today. In that part of the game, he's the best.'' By dominating from the start, controlling the points and forcing Clement to do most of the running, Agassi made it look easy. ``I don't self-inflict and throw curves at myself as much anymore,'' Agassi said. ``I don't make it tougher on myself. But to say it was easy would be misleading.'' He has long been praised as one of the most skilled ball-strikers in history, and now his trophy collection is beginning to reflect his talent. Agassi's seven major titles put him 10th on the men's list, tied with McEnroe, Wilander, John Newcombe and five others. He moves ahead of Becker and Edberg, who won six major titles each. He and Wilander are the only men to win three Australian Open titles in the Open era. ``It's history,'' Agassi said. ``The more experience you get, the more you allow yourself to enjoy it.'' And now he's a thirtysomething champion, which is a rarity but not unprecedented. After turning 30, Ken Rosewall won four Grand Slam titles and Jimmy Connors won two. Agassi? ``It's been a year since I've won,'' he said. ``I'll do my best not to make it another year until I win again.''

The father faced a budget deficit, the son a budget surplus. The father faced a brooding and uncertain Soviet Union, now a memory for the son. The father fought to save an embattled nominee. The son let a troubled appointment quietly fade away. The presidencies of George Herbert Walker Bush, and his son, George Walker Bush, are separated by a dozen years. And their first days in office are marked by as many contrasts as parallels. They already have one secure niche in history. George W. Bush is the first son to follow his father to the White House since John Quincy Adams did so in 1825. Twelve years ago, George W. Bush, speaking for his younger brothers and sisters, added the words, ``God protect our mother and father,'' to the litany he read at the prayer service marking his father's inauguration as the 41st president. On Sunday, Jan. 21, the Bush family again gathered under the gray-stone arches of Washington National Cathedral to mark the inaugural of the 43rd president. This time all the prayers were for the son. Both father and son got down to business as their terms started with almost the same words. ``I can't wait to get to work ... serious work,'' the elder Bush said in 1989. ``I'm really looking forward to getting to work,'' his son echoed last week. For all his eagerness, some charged the older Bush with getting off to a slow start, of ``hitting the ground walking'' on his top agenda issues. His son, ready to deflect such accusations, dedicated his first week to education reform. ``We are here to make progress, we are not here to mark time,'' the new president said. Although the younger Bush had marked education as the theme of his first week, his focus was joggled by the outcry over his first substantive act, an executive order banning U.S. aid to overseas charities that use their own money to provide abortions. ``Clearly the notion of 'uniter not divider' got seriously interrupted,'' said Rep. George Miller, D-Calif., citing a Bush campaign theme. A dozen years ago, looking at the South Lawn from the Oval Office, the elder Bush held firm to his campaign promise of ``read my lips, no new taxes.'' He did so even though the stubborn and growing budget deficit showed no signs of abating. Inheriting a growing budget surplus, his son has a more pleasant task. But he must tussle with Congress, not about raising taxes, but whether the surpluses should be used to cut them or pay off the federal debt. In January 1989, the elder Bush's most daunting challenge was the still frowning face of the Soviet Union. Bush was cheered by what he called a ``generous'' letter that first week from Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev. The Soviet threat, however, evaporated during his presidency, leaving his son with a memory, not a challenge. The elder Bush spent considerable time and political capital 12 years ago defending his contested choice of former Republican Sen. John Tower of Texas to be secretary of defense. Tower had come under attack for his allegedly heavy drinking and womanizing and was defeated in a Senate roll call. By contrast, his son acted quickly to replace Linda Chavez as the labor secretary nominee after revelations that she had given money and shelter to an illegal immigrant. Throughout his first week the elder Bush introduced the nation to what would become a personal watchword _ ``prudence.'' At his first news conference, he said he wanted to take the offensive in foreign policy rather than just react to moves by the Soviet Union. ``But prudence is the order of the day,'' the elder Bush said. He then used the word so many times it soon became part of the act for television comics doing George Bush impressions. He may have summed up for his son as well as himself when he dictated in this typically staccato summary of his first full day in office: ``I'm not quite used to being called 'Mr. President.' Beautiful winter day, January 21 _ clear, sunny, cold. The People's House, The Family's House _ it is great.'' ___ EDITOR'S NOTE _ Lawrence L. Knutson has covered the White House, Congress and Washington's history for more than 30 years.

Fresh from being vilified by anti-capitalists during a live debate via satellite, financier George Soros said he agrees with some of their complaints, even if he doesn't like their confrontational style. ``My masochism has its limits,'' he said at a news conference Monday at the World Economic Forum. Sunday's ``videobridge'' between people at the forum and opponents of globalization at the World Social Forum in Porto Alegre, Brazil, was a ``very interesting event ... that showed it's not very easy to engage in a dialogue,'' he said. ``Even though one doesn't agree with the methods used by the protesters, I think there is something to protest about,'' he added. Soros, a well-known currency speculator who concedes that he has profited from unregulated financial markets, listed several ways the global financial system could be improved. His proposals include creating incentives for investors to direct capital to developing markets; making more use of grants from the World Bank instead of loans to deal with crises such as AIDS; and better reconciling World Trade Organization rules with international pacts on labor rights and the environment. ``I would like a general dialogue on constructive reforms to improve the system,'' he said. ``These people are bent on destroying it,'' he added, referring to protesters who engage in violence or diatribes. ``That would be disastrous.''

it may be days or even weeks before we can know the full extent of the loss of life in the earthquake in western india. at the moment, officials will only say the number will run into the tens of thousands. given the magnitude of the human and structural loss, as you might expect, the rescue operations are difficult and slow. conditions are also difficult for journalists trying to get their stories and pictures out, as you'll see in this report from nbc's ron allen in india. all day, a frantic effort to save a mother and her two sons, medics racing to the scene when rescuers hear one of the young boys groaning. basically, it's slim, but we always pray for a miracle. and that's exactly what we're all doing here. but hope is fading here in bhuj, a town of 150,000, the size of fort lauderdale, now utterly devastated. one in five, some 30,000, injured. perhaps thousands more killed. their neighborhood, old bhuj, stood for some 400 years until the quake. now, just about every building in sight destroyed. the residents count some 50 to 60 dead right here. from the air, it looks like a bomb went off -- whole neighborhoods flattened, the hospital destroyed, doctors setting up a makeshift field clinic. now, four days after the quake, fear of a cholera or typhus outbreak, so the funeral pyres are manned round the clock, with volunteers, as thousands of bodies are cremated. the government says there may be 500,000 homeless. gas and water pipelines destroyed. many without water. in the nearby town of bhachau, a town of 25,000, only 5,000 of their residents can be found. piles of rubble mark the route where 400 students were on parade, celebrating the national holiday when the quake struck. a tidal wave of cement roared over the children. only 35 made it out alive. "suddenly, we don't know what happened. suddenly, the earth came apart. there was mayhem. we ran here, and a lot of my friends died." a mother stands vigil, holding a picture of her only son. "i am hoping that god will keep my son alive," she says, "but i just don know." today, india's prime minister admitted his country is not equipped to handle the disaster. the rescue effort slow off the mark with not enough equipment. dozens of foreign rescue teams, like this british unit in bhuj, are now on the scene, and late tonight, they finally lift 5-year-old parth from the rubble. his mother and brother did not survive. doctors tell the boy's father his will to live saved him. tonight, to the relief of his father and this devastated nation, a reminder there's still a chance. ron allen, nbc news, bhuj. american nancy retherford has been at ground zero ever since the quake hit. she's a worker with the red cross, and her job is to get rescue workers and equipment to as many places as possible. what it's like tonight, "in her own words." the devastation is just incredibly vast. when you see it on tv, the clips of it only show you from one edge of your screen to the other, but when you are actually here, everywhere you look as far as you can look there is devastation. closer to the epicenter some of the cities and villages have 90% to 95% total destruction, which doesn't leave much left to move on with, many of those people are actually moving out of the city to get away from the danger that any more of those building might fall. in the larger cities, most of the damage was caused by the high-rise apartment buildings that housed six or seven stories of families. they collapsed, and they killed and trapped hundreds of people. some of the structures that didn't crumble might have been laying sideways or crooked, and you can actually look up into some of these high-rises and see someone's bed or clothes or, you know, dresser hanging sideways. it's hardest for me to watch the people who, four days after this happened, are still holding out hope that their loved ones will be found alive. i think it's very difficult to see such a tremendous loss of life. nancy retherford of the red cross, "in her own words" tonight. and if you'd like to know how you can help, you can find a list of groups accepting contributions for earthquake victims at msnbc.com.

A federal judge ruled Monday that U.S. prosecutors could use statements given overseas by defendants in the 1998 bombings of U.S. Embassies in East Africa, even though the defendants were not given lawyers at the time and in some cases claimed they were threatened with violence during questioning. The judge, Leonard B. Sand of U.S. District Court in Manhattan, said that although ``classic Miranda doctrine'' calls for a defendant to be advised of the right to counsel and given a lawyer if he cannot afford one, that may not always be feasible where U.S. agents interrogate suspects on foreign soil. The ruling not only represented a victory for the government's efforts to prosecute the case, but could also have a major impact in the interrogations of terrorism suspects in the future. U.S. investigators, for example, are trying to track down about a dozen fugitives in terrorism cases who are believed to be hiding overseas, including Osama bin Laden, the Saudi exile who is charged in the East Africa attacks and is also suspected in the attack in Yemen on the USS Cole. In arguing to have their clients' statements tossed out as evidence, lawyers for Mohamed Rashed Daoud Al-'Owhali and Mohamed Saddiq Odeh, two of the defendants, said that in addition to not being offered lawyers or advised of their rights, their clients were threatened by U.S. agents during their questioning. They were told that if they did not talk, they would be left in the hands of the Kenyans, whom their clients feared would use violence on them, the lawyers said. But FBI agents have denied mistreating the suspects. In his ruling, Sand said that U.S. officials did not violate the due process rights of the defendants, and that he found the testimony of government agents ``entirely credible.'' Sand said that the decision by Al-'Owhali, a Saudi, to talk to his U.S. interrogators without a lawyer ``was a consequence of the strong desire he expressed to be tried in America so that he could confront directly his avowed enemy.'' Prosecutors say that in his statement to investigators, Al-'Owhali confessed to helping to carry out the embassy bombing in Nairobi, Kenya, on Aug. 7, 1998, which along with a nearly simultaneous blast in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, killed 224 people and wounded thousands. The ruling by Sand was in part a reversal of an earlier decision in which he ruled, in secret, that Al-'Owhali's statements should be suppressed. He later withdrew that opinion after the government asked for a chance to present new evidence and legal arguments, including on the Miranda issue. In his ruling Monday, Sand made clear that he was satisfied, based on the new evidence, that the authorities had complied with Miranda rules and constitutional requirements of due process. Sand said that in Al-'Owhali's two-week-long interrogation in Nairobi, for example, U.S. prosecutors and FBI agents were not wrong to tell him that he could not have a lawyer because that was accurate _ Kenyan law does not provide for one in such cases. ``Miranda,'' the judge said, ``which we find to be applicable as far as feasible to this interrogation, does not sanction or require the making of false statements to a suspect.'' Because the trial is so near _ the judge said he wanted to begin next Monday _ Sand said he was issuing the opinion orally, and would follow with a full opinion. So his announcement Monday came from the bench, without the citation of legal precedents or the disclosure of the vast amount of secret testimony and legal documents pertaining to the interrogations that have been filed with him. But legal experts who were interviewed after reading the transcript of the judge's ruling said it seemed significant. ``It's very important,'' said H. Richard Uviller, professor of law at Columbia University, ``because it underscores what the Supreme Court has said on other occasions _ that the precise form of the Miranda warnings is not written in stone.'' Yale Kamisar, a University of Michigan law professor and a leading expert on confessions, said the judge appeared to say that when ``American agents do the best they can possibly do'' in overseas interrogations, which may include slightly modifying Miranda, depending on the country and the situation, ``that's sort of a rough compliance, a satisfactory compliance with Miranda under the circumstances.''

Meanwhile President Bush is criticizing, but says he will not try to overturn the decision by former President Clinton to grant a pardon to fugitive American financier Mark Rich. The controversial pardon of Mr. Rich who has Democratic Party connections, was among the more than one hundred granted by Mr. Clinton in the final hours before he left office. VOA's David Gallust reports from the White House. Mr. Rich is a billionaire financier who has lived in European exile for nearly twenty years rather than face trial in the United States for criminal tax evasion. His inclusion on the list of last minute pardons by the former President triggered a storm of criticism from conservative commentators and Republican Congressional leaders who say they will investigate the affair. Officials of the Bush White House had in recent days told reporters that they were looking into legal technicalities that might be used to overturn the decision on Mr. Rich. However, in a talk with reporters here President Bush said there would be no such attempt. Mr. Bush said he is personally opposed to what Mr. Clinton did but that he considers the presidential right to pardon to be inviolate and that he is looking to preserve his own executive powers and those of his successors. I am troubled by the decision the President made. I would not have made the decision. I would not have made that decision. But nevertheless he was the President, he had the right to do so, to make that decision and he did. And I am going to protect that privilege not only for me but for future Presidents as well. Mr. Rich's former wife had in recent years donated more than a million dollars to Democrats including former First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton and her successful campaign for a US Senate seat. Republican Senator John McCain says that while Mr. Clinton may have had innocent motives for the pardon, the appearance of a possible connection with the political donations is outrageous and should give impetus to his drive for campaign finance reform. Other of Mr. Clinton's pardons announced less than two hours before he stepped down have drawn criticism, one was the pardon given to his brother Roger Clinton for a drug offence in the 1980's. Another was the one extended to Susan McDoogle, a figure in the White Water Real Estates scandal in which the Clintons were investigated for possible wrongdoing but never charged. Mr. Bush has said he intends to continue the practice of pardoning or commuting the prison sentences of persons deserving such treatment, but he says he has given no consideration to individual cases at this early point in his term. David Gallust, VOA News, the White House.

Only days after his father was assassinated, the new President at the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Joseph Kabila will make his first trip abroad by coming to the United States this week for talks with the Bush administration. VOA correspondent Nick Simeon reports. Sworn in as President last Friday, Joseph Kabila will have been in power less than a week when he arrives in Washington to attend an annual prayer breakfast. It's a private visit but he could end up seeing President Bush. US officials say they will use the opportunity to press him to distinguish himself from his assassinated father and work to end Congo's civil war. After three years the conflict is at a stalemate with the country split in half. Rebels backed by Uganda and Rwanda control much of the North and East leaving the Kinshasa government propped up by soldiers from Angola, Zimbabwe and Namibia. The murder earlier this month of President Loron Kabila is being seen as a turning point with Europe, the United States and South Africa all interested in trying to use the change in Congo's leadership to press for an end to a war that some estimates say has claimed nearly two million lives. Nick Simeon, VOA News in Washington.

Environmental activists urged the automotive industry Monday to reduce vehicle carbon dioxide emissions by 5 percent during the next decade. The heads of Greenpeace International and World Wildlife Fund International pressed the issue in a meeting with about 30 industry representatives on the fringes of the World Economic Forum in the Swiss ski resort of Davos. Although Greenpeace executive director Thilo Bode said ``there are no concrete results,'' he told a news conference he was encouraged that members of the industry at least acknowledged exhaust emissions were a problem. ``Action on climate change is needed, it is urgent, and the automotive industry has a special responsibility _ not only because it is perceived by the public as a big part of the problem but also because its carbon dioxide emissions are increasing at an alarming rate,'' he said. The head of the United Nations Environment Program, Klaus Toepfer, participated in the talks. Scientists have linked carbon dioxide pollution with the phenomenon of global warming. Greenpeace and the Worldwide Fund for Nature asked the car and tire makers to work together to make the emission cuts by 2010. That members of the auto industry agreed to the meeting was evidence that critics of the Davos forum have had some impact. Activists accuse business and government leaders at the six-day conference of neglecting social and environmental problems arising from global economic activity. Protesters dressed as industry ``fatcats'' marched briefly on the conference center earlier in the day, and Swiss security forces used water cannons to disperse a group of demonstrators in Davos over the weekend. Claude Martin, director general of WWF International, said he hoped to lobby auto executives individually over the next year, before holding a similar meeting at next year's forum. ``There are some forward-looking companies here,'' especially those from Europe, Martin said. He noted ``a rift'' between the European car makers and their U.S. counterparts, with the Americans seeming less concerned by emissions. Japanese industrialists were ``sitting on the ledge'' and wary of committing themselves one way or another, he said. Martin and Bode refused to identify any of the companies they met with.

The discovery of a living 8-month-old baby _ covered in his dead mother's blood but cradled in her lap _ on Monday captured the heartbreak and the singular miracles of India's killer earthquake. The rescue was rare cause for hope following the earthquake, which killed at least 6,200 people and as many as 20,000 _ or more. Damage was estimated at up to $5.5 billion. India's prime minister acknowledged Monday that his country was ill-prepared for disasters. In the case of the miracle baby, doctors said the warmth of his mother's body helped him survive three days in the ruins of a collapsed building in Bhuj's Kansara Market. ``We saw the baby in the mother's lap, we saw some movement from the baby,'' said R.K. Thakur, a Border Security Forces assistant commandant. ``I took the baby in my hand and I found it was alive.'' The boy, Murtza Ali, was rushed to a medical center, surviving relatives were found, and the child was conscious and smiling, Thakur said, adding: ``It was miraculous.'' There are few even partly happy endings in western India these days. Survivors complained Monday that confusion and a lack of equipment was hampering rescue efforts. Rescuers lacked cranes and bulldozers, and many units did not even have generators, making night work impossible without lights. Soldiers hunting for survivors began work at first light and stopped when the sun went down. The hope of finding many more survivors ``is dwindling hour by hour, but as long as there is hope, we won't give up,'' said Joachim Ahrens, who represents a Swiss rescue team in Bhuj. In the first estimate of damage, the Federation of Indian Chamber of Commerce and Industry Secretary General Amit Mitra said quake losses may be as high as $5.5 billion besides a daily production loss of $111 million. However, officials in Gujarat state, epicenter of Friday's magnitude 7.9 quake, put the figure at $2.17 billion. A grim-faced Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, who toured Gujarat on Monday, said he was forming a national disaster agency to ensure immediate response to emergencies. ``The country is not ready to face such disasters,'' Vajpayee told reporters in Ahmedabad, Gujarat's economic hub. He also announced federal grants totaling $108 million for the state. The prime minister noted that when a cyclone killed 10,000 people in the eastern state of Orissa two years ago, his government had trouble responding. He said it was facing similar problems now. ``I'm here to express my solidarity with the Indian people,'' Vajpayee said. ``They are not alone in this.'' In New Delhi on Monday, Agriculture Minister Bhaskar Barua appealed to private aid groups for field hospitals, clothing, volunteers to put up tents and prepare and distribute food, and cranes and other equipment. As recently as Sunday, Barua said it was the policy of his government not to ask for foreign aid. But he said India was thankful for the foreign help it had been offered. International aid so far includes $5 million in emergency supplies from the United States and $12 million in aid from Britain. At the Lohna Samshran crematorium on Monday, every effort was made to follow Hindu tradition for sending the quake's victims into the next life with respect. ``All methodologies are followed,'' said Rasik Thakkar, who manages the Lohna Shamshran. ``Those without relations, we'll take their bodies, process them according to Sanskriti teachings, and take them to Allahbad Sangram,'' a temple on the Ganges River, considered holy by Hindus. Normally each body is placed on its own funeral pyre, but that has not been the case since Friday. More than 6,200 dead have been registered across western India, but officials in Bhuj believe between 15,000 and 20,000 people may have died here alone. As many as 16 bodies were being placed on a single pyre and they were not being segregated by caste. By Monday, Thakkar and his workers had cremated 387 bodies and more were being brought in by truck and stretcher. Despite the enormity of the task, most Hindu traditions were followed. Tears running down their faces, relatives shared their grief along with the funeral pyres. ``We were very proud of our brother and his job,'' Damor Balawat Nuvajubhai said, after placing 24-year-old Damor Rajendrakumar Nuvajubhai, his body wrapped in a bed sheet, on a pyre. Rajendrakumar died while working as a nurse at the civilian hospital in Bhuj _ one of 36 nurses killed when the building collapsed. His brother Balawat took a large can of clarified butter, known in Hindi as ghee, and poured some onto the logs. He and his three other brothers then sat on a stack of wood, quietly weeping for an hour until three other bodies were placed on the 3-foot-high high stack of wood. Crematorium workers, wearing baseball caps and scarves over their mouths, placed more logs on top of the bodies and helped relatives of the victims start the fire and stoke it into a roaring blaze. The only sound came from the crackle of the fire and the engines of heavy trucks jamming the streets with relief supplies. The heat of the fire was so intense, no one could stand within 15 feet of the pyre. Normally the Lohna Shamshran uses two crematoria, but after the quake began building pyres all around the building, on 12 sites. Bhuj is located in a semi-desert with few trees, so officials have called for donations of wood. Outside the Lohna Shamshran, trucks unloaded tons of lumber donated from all over India. Elsewhere in India, fresh tremors panicked residents Monday, but there were no reports damage beyond minor cracks in buildings. A magnitude 4.3 quake was centered just outside Bangalore, 850 miles southeast of Bhuj.

In a rare humanitarian act between longtime rivals, a Pakistani air force plane was to carry relief material Tuesday to victims of India's devastating earthquake. Pakistani officials said a C-130 transport plane would leave Rawalpindi with about 13 tons of relief goods consisting of 200 tents and 2,500 blankets. Two more relief planes will be sent in the next couple of days, the officials said on condition of anonymity. The first plane was to land in Ahmedabad, the commercial capital of India' Gujarat state, which was the region hardest hit by the earthquake. India was struck by a 7.9-magnitude quake Friday that killed thousands. The logistics of the aid were worked out between Vijay Nambiar, the Indian High Commissioner to Pakistan, and Jehangir Ashraf Qazi, his counterpart in New Delhi. Pakistan offered help to India soon after the earthquake, but said Monday that India had turned down the offer. India denied this, saying New Delhi was willing to accept aid from any country. The two countries have fought three wars since the creation of Pakistan in 1947 after the partition of British colonial India.

With gruesome footage of people in flames and a badly burned 12-year-old girl crying for her mother, China gave its first detailed account Tuesday of an attempted group suicide by Falun Gong followers and said the self-immolation showed the sect is ``evil.'' Having initially suppressed domestic news reports of the Jan. 23 suicide attempt on Tiananmen Square, the government's decision to allow state television to air footage from security cameras appeared designed to validate its crackdown on Falun Gong and its claims the sect is a dangerous cult. State TV showed one man, his body and clothes charred and blackened, sitting crossed-legged in a distinctive Falun Gong meditation pose, reciting a sect slogan after police had doused the flames. Other people, identified by state media as four women, were shown engulfed in flames on the square as police rushed in with fire extinguishers. Of the five who set fire to themselves, 36-year-old Liu Chunling died, and her daughter, 12-year old Liu Siying, was among four others seriously injured, state TV and the government's Xinhua News Agency said. ``Mom, uncle, help! Help me!'' Xinhua said the girl cried as she caught fire. China Central Television showed her lying on Tiananmen's flagstones, her face, eyes and lips charred black in a cobweb pattern. ``Mom. Mom,'' she whimpered. In brief English-language Xinhua reports not published in the domestic Chinese media, the government said last week that five sect members poured gasoline on themselves and set themselves alight. But on Tuesday it said seven were involved in the suicide attempt. Police succeeded in stopping two people from igniting themselves, including a woman who drank gasoline from a Sprite bottle and yelled ``let me go to heaven'' after officers took away her lighter, Xinhua said. ``The tragedy once again demonstrated the evil nature of Falun Gong and sounded an alarm to those obsessed with the cult,'' it said. Falun Gong has disavowed any connection to the suicide attempt and urged Beijing in a statement Tuesday to allow outside investigation. The Beijing government, it said, has not proven the seven were sect members, adding that ``the teachings of Falun Gong strictly prohibit any form of killing, including suicide.'' The attempted suicide appeared to be sect followers' most radical act in what has largely been a campaign of civil disobedience against the communist government's 18-month ban on the group. It came three weeks after Li Hongzhi, Falun Gong's U.S.-based founder, revered as `Master' by his followers, suggested that more vigorous protest was justified. On Tuesday, the government tried to fix blame on Li. State media reiterated claims that Falun Gong has caused more than 1,600 deaths and cited a Jan. 1 statement on group Web sites in which Li said the crackdown can ``no longer be tolerated.'' ``The tragic participants in this self-immolation were cheated, poisoned and controlled by Li Hongzhi, serving as the cannon fodder and sacrificial objects for Li to reach his most evil goal,'' Xinhua said. State media underscored the government's claims it wants to help followers sever ties with Falun Gong and defended the crackdown as a just protection of human rights. The reports stressed the injured were treated at China's best-known hospital for burns. Xinhua said Liu Siying suffered burns over 40 percent of her body, an injured windpipe, fourth-degree burns to her face, and that all her fingers may have to be amputated. It said Liu's mother, who died of her burns, introduced her to Falun Gong last March. ``Didn't you know using a lighter to set fire to yourself would hurt?'' state TV showed a nurse asking the girl, whose gauze-covered body lay on a gurney. Liu replied she didn't know. She was shown telling a reporter: ``Auntie, I thought the road to the heavenly kingdom was golden.'' Falun Gong's slow-motion exercises and philosophy drawn from Buddhism, Taoism and Li's ideas attracted millions of Chinese before it was outlawed in July 1999. Practitioners claim Falun Gong promotes health and morality and gives experts supernatural powers. Unmentioned in the state media reports was the crackdown's relentless pursuit of practitioners. A Hong Kong-based rights group has counted more than 100 deaths of followers, mostly from police abuse. Thousands more have reportedly been imprisoned. State media said the seven ``obsessive'' Falun Gong followers came from central Kaifeng city and sought to commit suicide in hopes of ``ascending to heaven.'' They put gasoline in plastic Sprite bottles because ``gasoline looks similar to Sprite,'' carried backup lighters and agreed to ignite themselves simultaneously _ at 2.30 p.m. _ at different locations on Tiananmen's vast plaza, Xinhua said. Interviewed by state TV on his hospital bed, Wang Jindong, a 51-year-old identified as the suicide attempt's ringleader, appeared unrepentant despite his injuries. ``There will still be a final test,'' Wang said. ``Who says so?'' the reporter asked. ``The master,'' Wang said.

Gao Xingjian, the exiled Chinese writer who won the Nobel Prize in Literature last year, likes to steer clear of politics. But as Gao makes a three-day visit to Hong Kong this week, he is finding controversy impossible to avoid on the doorstep of the country he fled in 1987. Even before he spoke at a university here Tuesday, Gao had whipped up a tempest in this former British colony. Pro-Beijing figures warned him to watch his tongue, while pro-democracy leaders sharply criticized Hong Kong's government for snubbing the first Chinese novelist to win a Nobel Prize. ``Literature is above politics,'' Gao told a crowded lecture hall at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. ``It does not serve politics. For the past century, politics has interfered with literature.'' As if on cue, Gao was asked by a journalist in the audience to comment on reports that Hong Kong's chief executive, Tung Chee-hwa, and other dignitaries had declined to attend a reception in his honor. ``We're here to talk about literature,'' Gao said doggedly. ``I try my best to isolate politics from literature.'' Moments later, another questioner asked the writer how he could avoid talking about politics, given that he had been driven to leave China because of harassment by the Communist Party. ``Writers need freedom of expression,'' Gao replied in the closest he came to a political statement. ``They pay such great importance to freedom of expression. That's why they go into exile.'' Gao, who is 60 and now lives outside Paris, is a playwright and artist as well as a novelist. Although he has not returned to mainland China in 14 years _ and his works have been banned there since 1985 _ Gao has been a regular visitor to Hong Kong. Until the Nobel Prize turned him into a sudden celebrity, his visits here passed unnoticed. But Gao's triumph struck a nerve in Beijing. The Chinese government denounced the Nobel Committee for having ``ulterior political motives.'' ``China has had an outpouring of outstanding literary works and literary giants,'' the foreign ministry said, making it clear that in its view Gao was not among them. In 1983, a senior Communist official condemned his celebrated play, ``Bus Stop,'' as ``the most pernicious work since the establishment of the People's Republic.'' Gao renounced his party membership after the massacre in Tiananmen Square in 1989; he became a French citizen in 1998. Beijing's hostility put Hong Kong in an awkward spot. Under the terms of its return to Chinese rule in 1997, the city is guaranteed a high degree of autonomy. It remains open to visitors like Gao, or members of the Falun Gong spiritual movement, who are persona non grata on the mainland. Initially, Hong Kong seemed eager to play host to the Nobel laureate. Paul Leung, the director of leisure and cultural services, told the government-run radio station in October that Gao would be invited to a literature festival ``so that we can benefit from his experience as a writer.'' But the government later backtracked. A spokesman, John Tam, said Tuesday that the leisure and cultural services bureau was reorganizing the festival, and that Gao might no longer be a suitable participant. He denied that the author's political problems with the Chinese government were the reason. With no official invitation in the mail, Gao was invited instead by the Chinese University and the City University. The government tried to cushion the snub by sending the director of home affairs, Lam Woon-kwong, to attend Tuesday's lecture. But Tung, the Beijing-appointed chief executive of Hong Kong's government, declined to meet Gao, citing a previous obligation to meet with civil servants. ``The government won't have anything to do with him, to avoid angering Beijing,'' said Lau Siu-kai, a professor at Chinese University. ``But they have to allow him to come or else they'll be accused of suppressing free expression.'' Hong Kong navigated similar shoals earlier this month when it allowed a protest by Falun Gong. Officials said the Chinese government was furious at the decision, though it made no effort to reverse it. For the hundreds of students who flocked to hear the playwright who wrote ``Bus Stop'' (a collection of Gao's plays were published in English by the Chinese University Press in 1999) and the author of the 1989 novel ``Soul Mountain'' (published in English in 1999 by HarperCollins) the chance to see the Chinese writer of the moment overwhelmed any political considerations. ``I know he's under a lot of pressure from the Chinese government,'' said Brenda Ng, 17, a high school student who showed up with several friends. ``But we came because of his literature, not because of his politics.''

Nick Spence and his British rescue team fought for 12 hours to free a 10-year-old boy trapped under the ruins of his home by an earthquake that killed his mother and brother. At one point, it seemed the only hope was to saw off the boy's left leg, which was caught under debris. But the rescuers managed to free Parth Pradeep Joshi. Although Joshi's leg may still have to be amputated, he is alive. ``You live for those five seconds, when you pull someone out alive,'' said Spence, a 31-year-old paramedic working with the volunteer group RAPID U.K. ``You work in a confined space with your teammates, rolling in body fluids and decaying corpses, with bits of the building crashing down around you _ but then you have a moment like that.'' A small army of local and international rescue and relief workers is producing the occasional miracle for the beleaguered residents of Bhuj, near the epicenter of a 7.9 magnitude earthquake that struck Friday, killing thousands. But such moments are rare. British and Turkish rescuers had pulled five people alive from the ruined city by Tuesday _ and located more than 600 bodies. ``There can be voids in the rubble where people can survive for a few days, if they have water,'' said Mike Thomas, team leader for the 67-member British search and rescue efforts. ``But we're not seeing much sign of life.'' Spence and his 12-strong group are all volunteers _ including a fisherman, a shopkeeper and a college student _ who have completed a rigorous two-year training course. They work with saws, cutting tools, their bare hands, and even with wooden poles salvaged from the almost impassable maze of rubble that was Bhuj's historic old city. With other international groups and local charities, they are bringing survival and sustenance to this city. It is a piecemeal process, hampered by language barriers and lack of coordination in the first chaotic days after the quake. An American plane loaded with water purification equipment, blankets and other aid landed in New Delhi on Tuesday. The goods will be ferried to Gujarat on Indian air force planes, U.S. Embassy spokesman Gordon Duguid said. The United States had pledged $5 million in emergency help. India's chief regional rival, Pakistan, joined the list of countries offering help to victims Tuesday. The C-130 transport plane arrived in Ahmedabad, the commercial capital of Gujarat state, with about 13 tons of relief goods. At times, relief work is agonizingly slow. Arriving at one ruined house _ whose upper stories list like a sinking ship above the crushed ground floor _ the Britons and a Turkish team equipped with a sniffer dog receive a multilingual briefing with the aid of translators. Then Barney, a nine-year-old cocker spaniel who has worked in disaster zones from Turkey to Taiwan, Mozambique and El Salvador, is sent in to search for survivors. This time, there is no good news, and the group picks its way over the chunks of concrete and the dead bodies to the next house, the next family waiting with fading hope. Emergency workers say rescue efforts such as these, as well as aid for survivors, have yet to reach many parts of the earthquake-ravaged area. ``Even within the town there are pockets that haven't got any relief,'' said Usha Nath of Kutch Navnirman Abhiyan, an Indian volunteer group that is trying to coordinate the distribution of emergency aid. ``And outside Bhuj, the relief is only going to areas on the main road.''

Rescuers pulled survivors from the wreckage of India's earthquake just before bulldozers began to arrive Wednesday as the government of Gujarat state said 12,000 bodies had been recovered and the death toll was likely to reach 25,000. The estimate is based on the number of bodies recovered, those reported missing, the estimated number still lying under debris and reports gathered by government agencies, said Haren Pandya, home minister of Gujarat. ``The figure I am giving you today is the closest to the truth,'' Pandya said, announcing the higher numbers an hour after the state's emergency control room had said 7,162 bodies had been found. Indian Defense Minister George Fernandes on Wednesday maintained that over 100,000 had died, but Pandya said the state assessment was much lower. The increased numbers came as several rescue teams found people alive in the rubble of buildings just as bulldozers began smashing walls and experts laid explosives to clear away the rubble. A Russian rescue team in the town of Bhachau heard a woman screaming after a bulldozer smashed the wall of her three-story apartment building. The Russians found the woman's hand under a flattened concrete slab and held onto it until they pulled Kuntal Thakkar, 22, free. Then they freed her husband. In Bhuj, closest to the epicenter of the 7.9 earthquake, an army team rescued a 12-year-old girl named Viyanka and rushed her to the hospital. A demolition team hammering its way through a destroyed apartment block in Ahmedabad discovered Joytosna Gandhi still alive more than five days after the earthquake tore through the western Indian state. Gandhi was discovered next to the body of her teen-age son just as workers had all but given up hope of finding survivors and were beginning to knock down damaged buildings and clear away the wreckage. The condition of the 55-year-old woman testified to the slim chances of surviving for five days under a collapsed building. Both her legs and one hand had been crushed by concrete beams and had to be amputated, doctors said. She was in critical condition with kidney trouble. ``I don't know how she stayed alive with her dead son next to her,'' said Promila Ranadive, a neighbor. As the quake effort switched from rescue to relief, India faced expanding needs for food, clothing and shelter for survivors. The United Nations estimated there are 200,000 homeless in the western state of Gujarat where the quake did most of its damage. Countries and groups poured in aid as foreign rescue teams made their last rounds with trained dogs and seismographs before heading home. A U.N. World Food Program flight with 41 tons of cargo, including health kits and generators, left for India on Tuesday. Another flight was to leave on Thursday. Pakistan, with whom India has fought three wars, sent its second military plane in two days to Ahmedabad, loaded with tents and blankets. In Bhuj, volunteers from Germany, Finland, Belgium, India and the United States were working on a huge Red Cross field hospital with 310 beds and the capacity to treat up to 2,000 walk-in patients a day. Aftershocks jolted the quake zone early Wednesday, raising fears that more buildings could topple. India's Meteorological Department reported the strongest of the aftershocks at preliminary magnitude of 4.5. There were no reports of new injuries or damage. Special trains for people fleeing the region were scheduled to depart Ahmedabad on Wednesday afternoon. Among the luckiest survivors were the 800 people in a tent city in an open-air theater in Bhuj. With food from aid groups, neighbors have organized kitchens to feed tent-dwellers and thousands of others still living in the streets. Conditions, however, were grim. People were crowded under tents with sheets spread over the bare earth. Though food and drink were available, no sanitation system had been set up. Bharpi Thakkar, 42, huddled with her parents, three children, and four other families under a tent. ``We haven't had a chance to think about the future,'' she said, sipping tea. ``The challenge now is to deal with the present.'' Despite the dramatic rescues, hope of finding more survivors largely dried up Wednesday. Demolition crews using dynamite began clearing away the shells of damaged buildings and homes. In Ahmedabad, engineers wearing motorcycle helmets for protection broke up slabs of concrete with sledgehammers and crowbars. Clouds of dust rose into the air as bulldozers moved into the ruins. ``In most places we've used a small quantity of plastic explosives to pull down the more dangerously balanced parts,'' said Col. Rajat Raftogi, of the army engineering corps. ``It's a delicate operation which needs very careful handling.'' Trucks moved into town carrying large cranes and bulldozers. Wood was piled high along the sides of the roads in anticipation of further funeral pyres. At the Bhuj airport, workers put bodies into coffins on the runway, presumably for transport to other parts of India. The focus moved firmly Wednesday to the needs of survivors. Kenzo Oshima, U.N. undersecretary-general for humanitarian affairs, said Tuesday in New York that about 200,000 people were homeless. A U.N. disaster assessment team is working with the Indian government to coordinate international assistance teams, he said. Total damage from the quake has been estimated at up to $5.5 billion.

As the death toll from last week's devastating earthquake in India continues to rise volunteers and supplies from around the world are pouring into the shattered Indian State of Gujarat. Here in the United States Indian Americans are also working to provide help to their countrymen and women, while grieving the tremendous losses in their homeland. Joshua Livs reports on the relief efforts in and around the southeast city of Atlanta. At a Hindu temple in Clarkston, Georgia, people gather for the evening prayer. Devoted Hindus attend the prayer session every evening but this week there's an additional prayer for those afflicted by the earthquake. People who have lost close family in the disaster stay home and mourn for eleven days. Those here are praying for them and for the victims. It's not expressible, very heart breaking! Rajesh Patel is from Gujarat, the state worst hit by the quake. Large parts of it are nearly gone, as are some people he knew. We will pray to our God that nothing of this kind happens in any part of the world. This temple is part of the Swami Narayan Sect, several thousand strong in Atlanta. The sect is dominant in Gujarat so everyone in this temple shares a particular sense of loss. 24-year-old Ritesh Desai was born in Gujarat. He's still in shock from the news. Honestly speaking, I prefer not to picture the young children who don't have parents any more. There are parents who lost their kids. You know, you have mothers that know that their kid is buried under this rubble and they don't have any means of actually getting them out because even if you put 100 people on that slab to move it, you can't. There are cries from beneath the rubble. From the moment they heard the news about the earthquake Friday, Rajesh Patel and Ritesh Desai began mobilizing efforts to help the victims. The temple is part of the International Hindu Network VAPS that provides relief to disaster victims. The two men immediately started fund raising to support soup kitchens and shelters the group is sending out. They contacted friends and groups representing the 40,000 Indian people in Atlanta such as the National Federation of Indian Associations and the Gandhi Foundation. A local Indian TV program did a special report. Any organization which contributes more than 5000 dollars towards the relief will be entitled for a minimum of 5 minutes of Namaste Bombay airtime. The show has already promised free airtime... By the end of the weekend the groups had collected more than 40,000 dollars. Temple volunteer Dina Patel is helping run the collection. What we really need at this stage is cash. The reason is we have to respond faster. We are thinking both short-term and long-term. Short-term we have to help these people get food, have some kind... because it is at night it is about 40 degree or sometimes 35 degrees cold, so we want blankets, we want temporary shelter for them. Then what we need is medicines and all but what we need is the money so that we can quickly really, really react. Mr. Patel says in times like this many people are inclined to contribute clothing or even canned food but money is what best fuels the efforts of VAPS and there's relatively little delay in getting it there. Groups like Red Cross and Care are also on the scene feeding hundreds of thousands of people and providing shelter. The US government is providing military aircrafts and equipment to help sift through the rubble. The United Nations has offered millions of dollars in aid including plastic sheeting, blankets and generators. But giving in this case is especially meaningful for Indian-Americans according to Tilak Ratnalaswami, a Hindu religious leader who has been counseling the community. He says these people need to feel they are doing something. Yes, of course, because everybody wants to do something right now. Everybody wants to get involved, everybody wants to try and... especially the people in this country. They feel very helpless and it has brought everyone together. This weekend thousands will pack into Hindu Services in the Atlanta area and throughout the country. They will mourn loved ones and grieve the loss of part of their homeland. There will be more appeals for assistance and collections to help the victims. It will be a chance for people amid this tragedy. For VOA News now I'm Joshua Livs in Atlanta.
